thereof in the case of an Sterling Borrowing).

          (b)  Each Term Borrowing and each Revolving Borrowing denominated in
Dollars shall be comprised entirely of Eurocurrency Loans or ABR Loans, as the
Borrowers may request pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.04, as applicable. Each
Revolving Borrowing denominated in Sterling shall be comprised entirely of
Eurocurrency Loans. Each Lender may at its option make any Eurocurrency
Revolving Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; PROVIDED that any exercise of such option shall not
affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type
may be outstanding at the same time; PROVIDED,

<Page>

                                                                              21

HOWEVER, that none of the Borrowers shall be entitled to request any Borrowing
which, if made, would result in an aggregate of more than twelve separate
Borrowings being outstanding hereunder at any one time. For purposes of the
foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods or denominated in
different currencies, regardless of whether they commence on the same date,
shall be considered separate Borrowings.

          (c)  Subject to Section 2.05, each Lender shall make each Loan to be
made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer to such
account as the Administrative Agent may designate in federal funds (in the case
of any Loan denominated in Dollars) or such other immediately available funds as
may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in
Sterling not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, in the case of
fundings to an account in New York City, or 11:00 a.m., local time, in the case
of fundings to an account in another jurisdiction, and the Administrative Agent
shall by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of fundings to an account in
New York City, or 12:00 (noon), local time, in the case of fundings to an
account in another jurisdiction, credit the amounts so received to an account
designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, which
account must be in the country of the currency of the Loan (it being understood
that the funding may be for the credit of an account outside such country) or,
if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent
herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the
respective Lenders. Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with Section 2.16. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with this paragraph (c) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount in the required currency. If the Administrative Agent shall
have so made funds available then to the extent that such Lender shall not have
made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the
applicable Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon in
such currency, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the
applicable Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative
Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the
time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight
or short-term funds in the relevant currency (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error). If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute
such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
Borrower shall be entitled to request any Borrowing if the Interest Period
requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.

          SECTION 2.03.  LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, any Borrower may request the issuance of
Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or in Sterling for its own account, in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank,
at any time and from time to time after the date hereof and until the earlier of
the Maturity Date and the termination of the Commitments in accordance with the
terms hereof. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit

<Page>

                                                                              22

application or other agreement submitted by the applicable Borrower to, or
entered into by the applicable Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any
Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
Letters of Credit will be issued solely to support obligations owed to persons
that are Lenders as of the respective date of issuance of such Letters of
Credit.

          (b)  NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL, EXTENSION; CERTAIN
CONDITIONS. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the applicable
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing
Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of
Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on
which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c)
of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the
Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit
application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request
for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or
extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each
Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC
Exposure shall not exceed $15,000,000; (ii) the aggregate Revolving Exposures
shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments; and (iii)
the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Term Loans and the
aggregate Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in
effect.

          (c)  EXPIRATION DATE. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

          (d)  PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender
hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in
furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Revolving Percentage of each LC
Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable
Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any
reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be
made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                                                                              23

          (e)  REIMBURSEMENT. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the applicable Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is
received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii)
the Business Day immediately following the day that the applicable Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the
day of receipt. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due,
the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the applicable Borrower in respect
thereof and such Lender's Revolving Percentage thereof. Promptly following
receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent its Revolving Percentage of the payment then due from the applicable
Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to
Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.02(c) shall apply,
MUTATIS MUTANDIS, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to
this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving
Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by
a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for
any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Revolving Loan and shall not relieve
the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

          (f)  OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The applicable Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Affiliates, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any
direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages,

<Page>

                                                                              24

claims in respect of which are hereby waived by such Borrower to the extent
permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by the
Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and
other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross
negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank
may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

          (g)  DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank
has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; PROVIDED that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower
of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with
respect to any such LC Disbursement.

          (h)  INTERIM INTEREST. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount
thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the applicable Borrower
reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR
Loans; PROVIDED that, if the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC
Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section
2.09 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the
account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date
of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to
reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to
the extent of such payment.

          (i)  REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING BANK. The Issuing Bank may be replaced
at any time by written agreement among Holdings, the Administrative Agent, the
replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank.
At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the applicable Borrower
shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank
pursuant to Section 2.06. From and after the effective date of any such
replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and
obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of
Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing
Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall
require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced
Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the
rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                                                                              25

          (j)  CASH COLLATERALIZATION. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the applicable Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Lenders with LC Exposures
representing a majority in amount of the total LC Exposure demanding the deposit
of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the applicable Borrower shall
deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders, an amount in
cash equal to the total LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon; PROVIDED that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral
shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately
due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (l) or
(m) of Article VII. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent
as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the
Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive
dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits,
which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the applicable Borrower's risk and expense, such
deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the applicable Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders
with LC Exposure representing a majority in amount of the total LC Exposure), be
applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If
any Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a
result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not
applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business
Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

          SECTION 2.04.  BORROWING PROCEDURE. (a) In order to request a
Borrowing, the applicable Borrower shall give telephonic notice to the
Administrative Agent (confirmed by hand delivery or telecopy of a duly completed
Borrowing Request in the form of Exhibit A), (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency
Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, London time, three Business Days before a
proposed borrowing and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of a proposed borrowing. Such
notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case specify (i) in the case of a
Borrowing on the Effective Date, whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Term
Borrowing or a Revolving Borrowing, (ii) whether the Borrowing then being
requested is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing, (iii) the date
of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iv) the aggregate principal
amount of such Borrowing, (v) the currency of such Borrowing (which, in the case
of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, shall be Dollars) and (v) if such Borrowing is to
be a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no
election as to the currency of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing is specified
in any Borrowing Request, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested a Revolving Borrowing in Dollars. If no election as to the Type of
Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall
be an ABR Revolving Borrowing if denominated in Dollars or a Eurocurrency
Revolving Borrowing if denominated in Sterling. If no Interest Period with
respect to any Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
month's duration.

<Page>

                                                                              26

          SECTION 2.05.  INTEREST ELECTIONS. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall
be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of
a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in
such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such
Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of
a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided
in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to
different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing.

          (b)  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.04 if the Borrower were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery of
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

          (c)  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

               (i)   the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
          applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
          different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
          each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
          specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified
          for each resulting Borrowing);

               (ii)  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
          Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

               (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing
          or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

               (iv)  if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the
          Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
          election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of
          the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d)  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e)  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be (i)
in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, converted to an ABR

<Page>

                                                                              27

Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Sterling, converted
to a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default
is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be
converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid,
each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

          SECTION 2.06.  FEES. (a) Holdings agrees to pay to each Lender,
through the Administrative Agent, on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 31 and on the Maturity Date, a commitment fee (a "COMMITMENT Fee")
equal to 0.75% per annum on the daily average unused amount of the Revolving
Commitment of such Lender (whether or not the conditions set forth in Section
4.02 shall have been satisfied), during the preceding quarter (or shorter period
commencing with the date hereof or ending with the Maturity Date or any date on
which the Revolving Commitment of such Lender shall be terminated). All
Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall
commence to accrue on the date of this Agreement and shall cease to accrue on
the earlier of the Maturity Date and the date on which the Revolving Commitment
of such Lender shall have been terminated and the Loans of such Lender shall
have been repaid.

          (b)  Holdings agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in
Letters of Credit (an "LC PARTICIPATION FEE"), which shall accrue at the rate of
3.50% per annum, on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the later
of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which
such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a
fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately
agreed upon between Holdings and the Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of
the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
Disbursements) during the period from and including the date hereof to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date
on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's
standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder (together with such
fronting fee, the "ISSUING BANK FEES"). Participation fees and fronting fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
PROVIDED that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after
demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (c)  Holdings agrees to pay the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, such fees, and at such times, as have been separately agreed upon (the
"ADMINISTRATIVE FEES").

<Page>

                                                                              28

          (d)  All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as applicable, among
the Lenders (and, if applicable, to the Issuing Bank with respect to Fees owed
to it). Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable except in the case of
errors.

          SECTION 2.07.  REPAYMENT OF LOANS. (a) The outstanding principal
balance of each Loan shall be payable on the Maturity Date. Each Loan shall bear
interest from the date of the Borrowing of which such Loan is a part on the
outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.08.

          (b)  Each Lender shall, and is hereby authorized by the Borrowers to,
maintain, in accordance with its usual practice, records evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender hereunder from time to time,
including the date, amount, currency and Type of and the Interest Period
applicable to each Loan made by such Lender from time to time and the amounts of
principal and interest paid to such Lender from time to time in respect of each
such Loan.

          (c)  The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this Section 2.07 and in the Register maintained by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 10.04(d) shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations of each Borrower to which such entries
relate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative
Agent to maintain or to make any entry in such records or the Register, as
applicable, or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of any Borrower to repay any Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

          SECTION 2.08.  INTEREST ON LOANS. (a) Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.09, the Eurocurrency Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing
shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the LIBO Rate for the
Interest Period in effect for the Borrowing of which such Loan is part
multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 3.50% per annum.

          (b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09, the Loans comprising
each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, when
determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all
other times) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.50% per
annum.

          (c)  Interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement. The applicable LIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate for each
Interest Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.09.  DEFAULT INTEREST. If any Borrower shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration
or otherwise, such Borrower shall on demand from time to time from the
Administrative Agent pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the
actual number of days

                                                                              29

elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% per
annum (or, in the case of the principal of any Loan, if higher, the rate of
interest otherwise applicable, or most recently applicable, to such Loan
hereunder plus 2% per annum).

          SECTION 2.10.  ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing of any Type the Administrative
Agent shall have determined that Dollar deposits or deposits in Sterling in
which such Borrowing is to be denominated in the principal amounts of the Loans
comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the London interbank
market, or that the rates at which such deposits are being offered will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining
its Eurocurrency Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telecopy notice of such
determination to the applicable Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any
such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the
applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, any request by a Borrower for a Eurocurrency Borrowing
of the affected Type or in the affected currency shall be deemed to be a request
for an ABR Borrowing denominated in Dollars. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.11.  TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. (a) Unless
previously terminated under this Agreement, (i) the Term Commitments shall be
automatically and permanently terminated at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the Effective Date and (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall be automatically
terminated at the Administrative Agent's close of business in New York City on
the Maturity Date.

          (b)  Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or
telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, Holdings (on behalf of all the
Borrowers) may at any time in whole permanently terminate, or from time to time
in part permanently reduce, the Revolving Commitments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
(i) each partial reduction of a Revolving Commitment shall be in an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 or if
less, the remaining Revolving Commitment and (ii) no such termination or
reduction shall be made which would reduce the aggregate Revolving Commitments
to an amount less than the aggregate Revolving Exposures.

          (c)  On the date of any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section
2.12(e), the Revolving Commitments will be automatically reduced by an amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid multiplied by
a fraction of which the numerator is equal to the Revolving Commitments and the
denominator is equal to the outstanding Term Loans, in each case immediately
prior to such prepayment.

          (d)  Each reduction in the Revolving Commitments hereunder shall be
made ratably among the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective
Revolving Commitments. Holdings shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Revolving Lenders, on the date of each termination or reduction,
the Commitment Fees on the amount of the Revolving Commitments so terminated or
reduced accrued to but not including the date of such termination or reduction.

          SECTION 2.12.  PREPAYMENT. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part,
upon giving written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed
by written or telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent: (i) in the case of
Eurocurrency Loans no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business
Days prior to prepayment and (ii) in the case of ABR Loans, no later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the prepayment; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount which is (or the
Assigned Dollar Value of which is) not less than $5,000,000 and, except in the
case of Sterling Borrowing, an integral multiple of $1,000,000.

          (b)  On the date of any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.11, the Borrowers shall pay or prepay so much
of the Revolving Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate
Revolving Exposures will not exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments after
giving effect to such termination or reduction.

          (c)  In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Term Loans and the aggregate Revolving
Exposures exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrowers shall prepay Borrowings in
an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

          (d)  Each notice of prepayment under this Section shall specify the
prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof)
to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the applicable Borrower to
prepay such Borrowing (or portion thereof) by the amount stated therein on the
date stated therein. All prepayments under this Section shall be subject to
Section 2.15 but otherwise without premium or penalty.

          (e)  Each prepayment under this Section shall be applied first against
the Lenders' Revolving Loans to the extent of the amount of such Revolving Loans
that shall be outstanding at the time of such prepayment and then against
outstanding Term Loans.

          SECTION 2.13.  RESERVE REQUIREMENTS; CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement
any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender (or any
lending office of any Lender) or the Issuing Bank of the principal of or
interest on any Eurocurrency Loan made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
participation therein, or any Fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other
than changes in respect of taxes imposed on the overall net income or capital
stock of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal
office or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein), or shall
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or credit
extended by such Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or the Issuing
Bank, or shall impose on such Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank
market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any Eurocurrency Loan
made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein, and the
result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or to increase the cost to such
Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any
Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount
deemed by such

<Page>

                                                                              31

Lender to be material, then Holdings shall (or shall cause the Borrowers to) pay
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank upon demand such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b)  If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have determined that any
change after the date hereof in the applicability of any law, rule, regulation
or guideline adopted pursuant to or arising out of the July 1988 report of the
Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of
such Lender) or any Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with any
request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force
of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans or Letters of
Credit or participations therein made by such Lender or the Issuing Bank
pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender, the Issuing Bank or
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for
such applicability, adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's and the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's
and the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to be material, then from time
to time Holdings shall (or shall cause the responsible Borrower to) pay to such
Lender or the Issuing Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

          (c)  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth such
amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, shall be
delivered to Holdings and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Holdings
shall (or shall cause the responsible Borrower to) pay each Lender or the
Issuing Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it
within 10 days after the receipt of the same.

          (d)  Except as provided below in this paragraph (d), failure on the
part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation for any increased
costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on
capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand compensation with respect to such
period or any other period. The protection of this Section shall be available to
each Lender and the Issuing Bank regardless of any possible contention of the
invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other
change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed. Neither the
Issuing Bank nor any Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section
2.13 for any costs incurred or reductions suffered with respect to any date
unless it shall have notified Holdings that it will demand compensation for such
costs or reductions not more than 90 days after the later of (i) such date and
(ii) the date on which it shall have become aware of such costs or reductions.

          SECTION 2.14.  CHANGE IN LEGALITY. (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, if, after the date hereof, (i) any change in any law or
regulation or in the interpretation

<Page>

                                                                              32

thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or
interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
any Eurocurrency Loan or Sterling Loan or to give effect to its obligations as
contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan or Sterling Loan or
(ii) there shall have occurred any change in national or international
financial, political or economic conditions (including the imposition of or any
change in exchange controls) or currency exchange rates which would make it
impracticable for any Lender to make Loans denominated in Sterling or to any
Borrower, then, by written notice to the Borrowers and to the Administrative
Agent, such Lender may:

               (i)  declare that Eurocurrency Loans or Sterling Loans (in the
          affected currency or to the affected Borrower), as the case may be,
          will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness or
          impracticability) be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any
          request by a Borrower for a Eurocurrency Borrowing or Sterling
          Borrowing (in the affected currency or to the affected Borrower), as
          the case may be, shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request
          for an ABR Loan or a Loan denominated in Dollars, as the case may be,
          unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn (or, if a Loan
          to the requesting Borrower cannot be made for the reasons specified
          above, such request shall be deemed to have been withdrawn); and

               (ii) require that all outstanding Eurocurrency Loans or Sterling
          Loans (in the affected currency or to the affected Borrower), as the
          case may be, made by it be converted to ABR Loans or Loans denominated
          in Dollars, as the case may be, in which event all such Eurocurrency
          Loans or Sterling Loans (in the affected currency or to the affected
          Borrower) shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans or Loans
          denominated in Dollars, as the case may be, as of the effective date
          of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurocurrency Loans or Sterling Loans, as the case may be, that would
have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurocurrency Loans or Sterling
Loans, as the case may be, of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
ABR Loans or Loans denominated in Dollars, as the case may be, made by such
Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurocurrency Loans
or Loans denominated in Dollars, as the case may be.

          (b)  For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice to the Borrowers by
any Lender shall be effective as to each Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the
Interest Period currently applicable to such Loan; in all other cases such
notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrowers.

          SECTION 2.15.  INDEMNITY. The Borrowers agree to indemnify each Lender
against any actual loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) any failure by such Borrower to fulfill on the date of any
borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b) any
failure by such Borrower to borrow or to convert or continue any Loan hereunder
after irrevocable notice of such borrowing, conversion or continuation has been
given or deemed given pursuant to Section 2.04 or 2.05, (c) any payment,
prepayment, conversion or transfer of a Eurocurrency Loan required by any other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a date other
than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any default in
payment or prepayment of the principal

<Page>

                                                                              33

amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when
due and payable (at the due date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity,
acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise) or (e) the
occurrence of any other Event of Default, including, in each such case, any
actual loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be sustained or
incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties acquired to
effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurocurrency Loan. Such
loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds
for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted, transferred or not borrowed
(assumed to be the LIBO Rate) for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, conversion, transfer or failure to borrow to the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the
Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such
failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such
Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid,
prepaid, converted, transferred or not borrowed for such period or Interest
Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount
or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

          SECTION 2.16.  PRO RATA TREATMENT. (a) Except as required under
Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal
of any Revolving Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Revolving Loans,
each payment of the Commitment Fees, each payment constituting reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement, each reduction of the Revolving Commitments and each
conversion or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing with a Revolving Borrowing
of any Type, shall be allocated pro rata among the Revolving Lenders in
accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Revolving
Loans. Each Revolving Lender agrees that in computing such Revolving Lender's
portion of any Revolving Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative
Agent may, in its discretion, round each Revolving Lender's percentage of such
Revolving Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar (or comparable unit
of Sterling) amount.

          (b)  Except as required under Section 2.14, each Term Borrowing, each
payment or prepayment of principal of any Term Borrowing, each payment of
interest on the Term Loans, and each conversion or continuation of any Term
Borrowing with a Term Borrowing of any Type, shall be allocated pro rata among
the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective Term Commitments or, if
such Term Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with
the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Term Loans.

          SECTION 2.17.  SHARING OF SETOFFS. Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
against any Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title
11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in
lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means,
obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loan or Loans or
reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement (other than pursuant
to and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement) as a result of which
the unpaid principal portion of its Loans or LC Disbursements shall be
proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans or LC
Disbursements of any other Revolving Lender or Term Lender, as applicable, it
shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face
value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a
participation in the Loans and LC Disbursements of such other Lender, so that
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and LC

<Page>

                                                                              34

Disbursements and participations in the Loans and LC Disbursements held by each
Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of all Loans and LC Disbursements then outstanding as the principal amount of
its Loans and LC Disbursements prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff
or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans and LC
Disbursements outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim or other event; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if any such purchase or
purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.17 and the
payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or
purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and
the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The
Borrowers expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that any
Lender holding a participation in a Loan or LC Disbursement deemed to have been
so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by such Borrower to such
Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan or LC
Disbursement directly to such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          SECTION 2.18.  PAYMENTS. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment
(including principal of or interest on any Borrowing, reimbursements of LC
Disbursements or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under each other Loan
Document, without setoff or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 noon, local time
at the place of payment, on the date when due in immediately available funds.
Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at
1111 Fannin, 10th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002. Each such payment (other than
principal of and interest on Sterling Loans, which shall be made in Sterling)
shall be made in Dollars and each Sterling payment should be made at the offices
of the Administrative Agent at 125 London Wall, London, England EC2Y5AJ, or any
other account that the Administrative Agent may designate.

          (b)  Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing, reimbursements of LC Disbursements or any Fees or other amounts)
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would
occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

          SECTION 2.19.  TAXES. (a) Each Borrower covenants and agrees that,
whether or not any Loans are made by the Lenders or Letters of Credit are issued
by the Issuing Bank hereunder:

               (i)  all payments on account of the principal of and interest on
          the Loans, and all other amounts payable by each Borrower hereunder,
          to or for the account of the Lenders including, without limitation,
          amounts payable under clause (ii) of this Section 2.19(a), shall be
          made without any setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of, and
          without reduction by reason of, all present and future income, stamp,
          documentary, registration, excise, property and other taxes and
          levies, deductions, charges, compulsory loans and withholdings
          whatsoever (other than income or franchise taxes imposed on the
          overall net income or capital stock of the Administrative Agent, the
          Issuing Bank or any Lender, including any transferee or assignee
          thereof ("TRANSFEREE"), by the taxing authority of the jurisdiction in
          which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, has its
          principal lending office or under the laws of which the Administrative
          Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as applicable, is organized)
          and all interest,

                                                                              35

          penalties or similar amounts with respect thereto, now or hereafter
          imposed, assessed, levied or collected by any country or any political
          subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or by any
          federation or association of or with which any country may be a member
          or associated or by any jurisdiction from which any payment hereunder
          is made or any taxing authority thereof or therein, on or in respect
          of this Agreement, the recording, registration, notarization or other
          formalization of any thereof, the enforcement thereof or the
          introduction thereof in any judicial proceedings, or on or in respect
          of any payments of principal, interest, premiums, charges, fees or
          other amounts made on, under or in respect of any thereof (hereinafter
          called "Taxes"), all of which will be paid by the appropriate
          Borrower, for its own account, prior to the date on which penalties
          attach thereto;

               (ii)  the Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
          Issuing Bank and Lenders against, and reimburse the Administrative
          Agent, the Issuing Bank and Lenders (or Transferees) on demand for,
          any Taxes and any loss, liability, claim or expense arising therefrom
          or with respect thereto, including interest, penalties and reasonable
          legal fees and disbursements, which the Administrative Agent or the
          Issuing Bank may incur, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or
          legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority. A certificate as to
          the amount of such Tax, loss, liability, claim or expense prepared by
          the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, absent manifest error,
          shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such
          indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the
          Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank makes a written demand
          therefor;

               (iii) in the event that a Borrower is required by applicable law,
          decree or regulation to deduct or withhold Taxes from any amounts
          payable on, under or in respect to this Agreement, such Borrower shall
          pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the applicable
          Lenders, as the case may be, such additional amount(s) as may be
          required, after the deduction or withholding of Taxes (including any
          deduction or withholding of Taxes with respect to such additional
          amounts), to enable the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such
          Lender to receive from such Borrower an amount equal to the amount
          stated to be payable by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the
          Issuing Bank or such Lender under this Agreement;

               (iv)  each Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the
          official tax receipts in respect of each payment of Taxes required
          under this Section 2.19(a) within 30 days after the date such payment
          is due pursuant to applicable law, and each Borrower shall promptly
          furnish to the Bank, at the Administrative Agent's request, any other
          information, documents and receipts that the Administrative Agent may,
          from time to time, reasonably require to establish to its reasonable
          satisfaction that full and timely payment has been made of all Taxes
          required to be paid under this Section 2.19(a);

               (v)   in the event that the payments by a Borrower become exempt
          from or not subject to Taxes, such Borrower will, upon the reasonable
          request of the Administrative Agent, furnish to the Administrative
          Agent either a certificate

<Page>

                                                                              36

          from each appropriate taxing authority or an opinion of counsel
          reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in either case
          stating that payments hereunder are exempt from or not subject to
          taxes; and

               (vi)  if a Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing Bank or the
          Administrative Agent shall become aware that it is entitled to receive
          a refund in respect of Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a
          Borrower, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional
          amounts, pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall promptly notify the
          Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days
          after receipt of a request by the Borrower, make a claim to the
          relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority for such
          refund at the Borrower's expense. If any Lender (or Transferee), the
          Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent receives a refund (including
          pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the preceding
          sentence) in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified
          by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional
          amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall promptly repay such
          refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
          additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.19 with
          respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
          out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing
          Bank or the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower; each Borrower, upon
          the request of such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative
          Agent, agrees to return any such refund (plus penalties, interest or
          other charges) to such Lender (or Transferee), the Issuing Bank or the
          Administrative Agent in the event such Lender (or Transferee), the
          Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such
          refund to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental
          Authority.

               (vii) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
          reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in
          which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction
          is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall
          deliver to Holdings (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the
          time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed
          and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
          requested by Holdings as will permit such payments to be made without
          withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Lender has
          received written notice from the Borrower advising it of the
          availability of such exemption or reduction and supplying all
          applicable documentation.

          (b)  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations of each Borrower pursuant to
this Section 2.19 shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and
interest on the Loans.

          SECTION 2.20.  ASSIGNMENT OF COMMITMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
(a) Any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant
to Section 2.13 or Section 2.19 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with
legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document requested
by a Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if
the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the
amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue and would not,
in

<Page>

                                                                              37

the judgment of such Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to
such Lender (or Transferee).

          (b)  In the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice or
certificate pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.14, or a Borrower shall be required to
make additional payments to any Lender under Section 2.19, Holdings shall have
the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, to require such Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04) all
its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to another financial
institution approved by the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) which shall assume such obligations; PROVIDED that (i) no
such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority and (ii) the assignee shall pay to the affected Lender in
immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and
interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and a
Borrower shall pay to the affected Lender in immediately available funds on such
date all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder.

                   ARTICLE III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          Holdings and each Borrower represents and warrants that:

          SECTION 3.01.  CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND GOOD STANDING. Holdings and
each of its Material Subsidiaries: (a) is a corporation, partnership or other
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization; (b) has all requisite corporate or other
power, and has all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals, necessary to own its assets and carry on its business as now being or
as proposed to be conducted; and (c) is qualified to do business and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification necessary and where failure so to qualify or to be
in good standing could reasonably be expected to (either individually or in the
aggregate) result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.02.  CORPORATE POWER, AUTHORIZATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE
LAW. (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrowers of this
Agreement and by Holdings and the Subsidiaries of the other Loan Documents to
which they are to be party are within their respective corporate powers, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and will not violate any
provision of law of or their articles of incorporation, by-laws or memoranda or
articles of association, or result in the breach of or constitute a default
under or require any consent under any indenture or other material agreement or
instrument to which Holdings or any Subsidiary is a party or by which Holdings
or any Subsidiary or its respective properties may be bound or affected, or
cause any of its properties to become subject to any Lien; this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower; and each
other Loan Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Holdings and each Subsidiary (to the extent Holdings or such Subsidiary is party
thereto) enforceable against such person in accordance with its terms.

          (b)  The conduct by Holdings and its Subsidiaries of their respective
businesses as they are presently operated does not violate any material
provision of law or material rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority in
a manner which, when taken together with all other

<Page>

                                                                              38

such violations, could reasonably be expected to result in a Materially Adverse
Effect; and Holdings and its Subsidiaries have obtained all material consents
and approvals of Governmental Authorities required to conduct their respective
businesses as they are presently operated, except to the extent that failure to
obtain any such consents or approvals could not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.03.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION; ABSENCE OF MATERIAL ADVERSE
CHANGE. (a) The audited consolidated financial statements of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, certified by
independent public accountants selected by Holdings, fairly present the
financial condition of Holdings and its Subsidiaries at the date of such
statements and the results of their respective operations for the fiscal year
ended on said date, all in conformity with GAAP.

          (b)  The consolidating balance sheets by geographic region of Holdings
and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, were prepared by the management of
Holdings in good faith.

          (c)  The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Holdings and
its Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September
30, 2002, heretofore delivered to the Administrative Agent fairly present the
financial condition of Holdings and its Subsidiaries at the dates of such
statements and the results of their respective operations for the fiscal
quarters ended on such dates, all in conformity with GAAP.

          (d)  Since December 31, 2001, there has occurred no Material Adverse
Change.

          SECTION 3.04.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Each of the Borrowers and its
ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder. No Reportable Event has occurred in respect of any
Plan of any Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate. The present value of all benefit
liabilities of all underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions used to fund
each such Plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation dates applicable
thereto, exceed by more than $5,000,000 the value of the assets of all such
underfunded Plans. Neither the Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate have incurred
any Withdrawal Liability that materially adversely affects the financial
condition of any Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates taken as a whole. Neither the
Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate have received any notification that any
Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within the
meaning of Title IV of ERISA, and no Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected
to be in reorganization or to be terminated, where such reorganization or
termination has resulted or can reasonably be expected to result in an increase
in the contributions required to be made to such Plan that would materially and
adversely affect the financial condition of any Borrower and its ERISA
Affiliates taken as a whole.

          SECTION 3.05.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. The Borrowers are aware of no
events, conditions or circumstances involving environmental pollution or
contamination or employee health or safety that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Change.

          SECTION 3.06.  LITIGATION. (a) There are no suits, investigations or
proceedings pending or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened, against or
affecting Holdings or the Subsidiaries which call into question the validity of
this Agreement or could reasonably be

<Page>

                                                                              39

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than suits,
investigations or proceedings referred to in the definition of "Litigation
Liabilities" to the extent no Default shall have resulted therefrom under
Section 6.08 or any other provision of this Agreement).

          (b)  Except as described in Schedule 3.06(b) hereto, (i) all suits,
investigations or proceedings that have resulted or are expected to result in
Litigation Liabilities have been settled pursuant to the Settlement Agreements,
all of which have been approved by the applicable courts pursuant to
non-appealable orders, and (ii) all amounts due or to become due under the
Settlement Agreements have been accrued for or paid in full.

          SECTION 3.07.  TAXES. Holdings and its Subsidiaries have filed all
Federal and other material tax returns required to be filed and paid all Federal
and other material taxes due or assessed indicated thereon, including interest
and penalties, except for taxes which are being contested in good faith and by
applicable proceedings, and for which Holdings and its Subsidiaries have made
adequate reserves on the books of Holdings and its Subsidiaries.

          SECTION 3.08.  SUBSIDIARIES. Schedule 3.08, as the same shall be
updated by Holdings from time to time by means of one or more notices delivered
to the Administrative Agent, correctly sets forth the name of each Subsidiary of
Holdings, its jurisdiction of incorporation and the percentage of each class of
issued and outstanding capital stock owned by Holdings and any Subsidiary,
respectively, if any; the corporations listed on Schedule 3.08 are the only
Subsidiaries of Holdings as of the date of this Agreement.

          SECTION 3.09.  INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. Neither Holdings nor any of its
Subsidiaries is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

          SECTION 3.10.  NO MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS. No information, report,
financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of any
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with this
Agreement or included herein or delivered pursuant hereto contained or contains
any material misstatement of fact or omitted or omits any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, or are made, not misleading.

          SECTION 3.11.  FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS. (a) Neither Holdings nor
any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one if its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying Margin Stock.

          (b)  No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether
directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, (i)
to purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose
of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock or to refund indebtedness originally
incurred for such purpose or (ii) for any purpose which entails a violation of,
or which is inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of the Board,
including Regulation U or X.

          SECTION 3.12.  TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Holdings and its Subsidiaries have
good title in fee simple to, or valid and subsisting leasehold interests in, all
their respective material real properties, and good title to all their
respective material other properties, reflected on the financial statements of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries referred to in Section 3.03 above, except

property disposed of in the ordinary course of business and except that SIBS's
ownership interest in the York Avenue Property has been replaced by a leasehold
interest in favor of Sotheby's, Inc. pursuant to the Sale and Leaseback, and
none of such properties or documents of title relating to such properties are
subject to any Liens except Liens permitted by Section 6.01.

          SECTION 3.13.  USE OF PROCEEDS. The Borrowers will use the proceeds of
the Loans only for the purposes specified in the preamble to this Agreement.

          SECTION 3.14.  SECURITY DOCUMENTS. (a) The Pledge Agreement is
effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent a legal, valid and
enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined therein), and
constitutes a perfected first priority Lien on and security interest in all

          (d)  The Collateral and Guarantee Requirement has been satisfied.

          (e)  The UK Securities Mortgage is effective to create in favor of the
Collateral Agent a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the pledged
equity interests of the UK Borrowers, and constitutes a perfected first priority
Lien on and security interest in all right, title and interest of each pledgor
thereunder.

          (f)  The Swiss Securities Mortgage is effective to create in favor of
the Collateral Agent a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the

first priority Lien on and security interest in all right, title and interest of

                             ARTICLE IV. CONDITIONS

The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the

          SECTION 4.02.  EACH BORROWING DATE. On the date of each Borrowing and
on the date of issuance of any Letter of Credit:

               (a)  The Administrative Agent shall have received a notice of
          such Borrowing as required by Section 2.04.

               (b)  The representations and warranties set forth in Article III
          hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of
          the date of such Borrowing with the same effect as though made on and
          as of such date, except to the extent such representations and
          warranties expressly relate to an earlier date.

               (c)  Each Borrower shall be in compliance with all the terms and
          provisions set forth herein and at the time of and immediately after
          such Borrowing no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and
          be continuing.

               (d)  After giving effect to such Borrowing or the issuance of

Each Borrowing shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by
each Borrower on the date of such Borrowing (a) as to the matters specified in
paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 4.02 and (b) that no material event
has occurred since the previous fiscal quarter end that would require the
recording of a liability under FASB Statement No. 5 with respect to Litigation
Liabilities, which leads Holdings to believe that a Default will occur under
Section 6.08 or Section 6.09 as of the next fiscal quarter end.

                        ARTICLE V. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

          The Borrowers covenant and agree with each Lender that, so long as
this Agreement shall remain in effect or the principal of or interest on any
Loan, any Fees or any other expenses or amounts payable under any Loan Document
shall be unpaid, or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding, unless the
Required Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing, Holdings will, and will
cause each of the Subsidiaries to:

          SECTION 5.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. In the case of Holdings, furnish

          related statements of income and operations and changes in financial
          position and of shareholder's equity for such year, all prepared in

          quarter and the related statement of income for such period, all
          prepared in accordance with GAAP and certified by the Financial
          Officer of Holdings;

               (c)  (i) at the time of each delivery of financial statements

          amounts, ratios and baskets referred to in Sections 6.07, 6.08, 6.09
          and 6.10, and (ii) within 45 days after the end of each calendar
          quarter, a completed Borrowing Base Certificate setting forth the
          calculation of and certifying the Borrowing Base as of the last day of
          such calendar quarter, certified as complete and correct and signed on
          behalf of Holdings by a Financial Officer, together with such other
          supporting documentation and additional reports with respect to the
          Borrowing Base as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request;

               (d)  promptly after the filing thereof, copies of all forms and
          reports filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission and,

any event with respect to a Borrower described in paragraph (l) or (m) above,
the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans
then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued

                            ARTICLE VIII. THE AGENTS

          In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
JPMCB is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent on
behalf of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Agents to take such actions on behalf of such Lender and to exercise such powers
as are specifically delegated to the Agents by the terms and provisions hereof
and of the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly
authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to
receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on
the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to
distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) as
provided in Article VII, to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the
Borrowers of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the
Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency
hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial
statements and other materials delivered by any Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement as received by the Administrative Agent.

          Neither the Agents nor any of their directors, officers, employees or
agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by any of them
except for its or his own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, or be
responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the contents
of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or
to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrowers of
any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan
Document. The

                                                                              53

Agents shall not be responsible to the Lenders for the due execution,
genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this Agreement, or any
other Loan Documents or other instruments or agreements. The Agents shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance
with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders and, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action or
inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders. The Agents shall,
in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any
instrument or document believed by them in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons. Neither the
Agents nor any of their directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any
responsibility to the Borrowers on account of the failure of or delay in
performance or breach by any Lender of any of its obligations hereunder or to
any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any
other Lender or a Borrower of any of their respective obligations hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith. The Agents
may execute any and all duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents by
or through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of
legal counsel selected by them with respect to all matters arising hereunder and
shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by them in
accordance with the advice of such counsel.

          The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agents shall be under no duty
to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by them pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless they shall be
requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at
any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrowers. Upon any
such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York,
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate
of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

          With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, the Agents in their
individual capacity and not as Agents shall have the same rights and powers as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though they were not the Agents,
and the Agents and their Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if they were not the Agents.

          Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse the Agents, on demand, in the
amount of its pro rata share (based on its outstanding Term Loans, Revolving
Exposures and unused Commitments at the time of such demand) of any expenses
incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by the Agents, including counsel fees
and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of
the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed by one of the

                                                                              54

Borrowers and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless the Agents and any of their
directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro
rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against them in their capacity as Agents or any of them in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
any action taken or omitted by any of them under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the
Borrowers; PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable to the Agents for any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agents or any of their directors,
officers, employees or agents.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed applicable, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
applicable, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.


                              ARTICLE IX. GUARANTEE

          SECTION 9.01.  GUARANTEE. Subject to the last sentence of this Section
9.01(a), each Guarantor hereby guarantees to each Lender and the Administrative
Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full
when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by optional prepayment or
otherwise) of the Obligations, strictly in accordance with the terms thereof.
Each Guarantor hereby further agrees that if any Borrower shall fail to pay in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by optional
prepayment or otherwise) any of the Obligations, the Guarantor will promptly pay
the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the same will
be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, Oatshare Limited
and Sotheby's will not be liable as Guarantors for the Obligations of Holdings,
Sotheby's, Inc. and Sotheby's Global Trading GmbH.

          SECTION 9.02.  OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of each
Guarantor under Section 9.01 hereof are absolute and unconditional irrespective
of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the
obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or
exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Obligations, and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other
circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this
Section 9.02 that the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more
of the following shall not affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder:

                                                                              55

          (a)  at any time or from time to time, without notice to the
Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the
Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be
waived;

          (b)  any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this
Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein
shall be done or omitted; or

          (c)  the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be accelerated, or
any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any
respect, or any right under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of
the Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole
or in part or otherwise dealt with.

Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed
against any Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any other
guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations.

          SECTION 9.03.  REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of each Guarantor under
this Article IX shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower in respect of the
Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of
the Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration.

          SECTION 9.04.  SUBROGATION. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives
all rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising by operation of law
(including, without limitation, any such right arising under Title 11 of the
United States Code) or otherwise, by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IX and further agrees for the benefit of each of its
creditors (including, without limitation, each Lender and the Administrative
Agent) that any such payment by it of the Obligations of any Borrower shall
constitute a contribution of capital or a dividend, as the case may be, by such
Guarantor to such Borrower.

          SECTION 9.05.  REMEDIES. Each Guarantor agrees that, as between the
Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement
may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VII
hereof (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the
circumstances provided in said Article VII) for purposes of Section 9.01 hereof
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
declaration (or preventing such obligations from becoming automatically due and
payable) as against any Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or
such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable),
such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Borrower) shall
forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for purposes of such Section
9.01.

          SECTION 9.06.  CONTINUING GUARANTEE. The guarantee in this Article IX
is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising.

          date shall be at least five Business Days after the execution thereof,
          the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of
          the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
          have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and
          the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
          assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from
          its obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment
          and Assumption Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender's rights
          and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
          party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
          Sections 2.13, 2.15, 2.19 and 10.05, as well as to any Fees accrued
          for its account hereunder and not yet paid). Any assignment or
          transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
          that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for
          purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation
          in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of the
          Section.

               (iv)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption
          Agreement, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder
          shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other
          parties hereto as follows: (A) such assigning Lender warrants that it
          is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned
          thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that its Commitment,
          if any, and the outstanding balances of its Loans, if any, in each
          case without giving effect to assignments thereof which have not
          become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption

                                                                              59

          Agreement, (B) except as set forth in (A) above, such assigning Lender
          makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
          respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
          connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity,
          enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement,
          any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished
          pursuant hereto or the financial condition of the Borrowers or any
          Subsidiary or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of
          its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
          other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (C) such
          assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to
          enter into such Assignment and Assumption Agreement; (D) such assignee
          confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
          copies of the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to
          Section 5.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
          applicable to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
          such Assignment and Assumption Agreement; (E) such assignee will
          independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such
          assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
          information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
          its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
          Agreement; (F) such assignee appoints and authorizes the
          Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
          exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
          Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as
          are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) such assignee agrees that
          it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations
          which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by
          it as a Lender.

               (v)   The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
          agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of
          each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it and a
          register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
          Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and
          LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
          from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall
          be conclusive in the absence of manifest error and the Borrowers, the
          Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each
          person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
          hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
          notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
          available for inspection by the Borrowers, the Issuing Bank and any
          Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
          prior notice.

               (vi)  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
          Assumption Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee,
          an Administrative Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee
          (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the
          processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this
          section and any written consent to such assignment required by
          paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall (i)
          accept such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, (ii) record the
          information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt
          notice thereof to the Lenders. No assignment shall be effective for
          purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register
          as provided in this paragraph.

                                                                              60

          (c)  (i) Each Lender may, without the consent of Holdings, the Issuing
Bank or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment,
if any, and the Loans or LC Disbursements owing to it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
(A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B)
such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first provision to Section 10.08(b) that affects such
Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrowers agree
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.15
and 2.19 to the same extent as if it were a lender and had acquired its interest
by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.06
as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.

          (ii)  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.13, 2.15 and 2.19 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation is made with the prior written
consent of Holdings. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.19 unless Holdings is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to
comply with Section 2.19(a)(vii) as though it were a Lender.

          (d)  Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 10.04, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant any information relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender
by or on behalf of the Borrowers; PROVIDED that, prior to any such disclosure of
information, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall execute an agreement whereby such assignee or participant
shall agree on terms substantially similar to those set forth in Section 10.17
to preserve the confidentiality of such confidential information.

          (e)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including without limitation (i) any pledge or assignment to
secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank and (ii) in the case of any Lender
that is a fund that invests in loans, any pledge or assignment to any holders of
obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Lender, including to any trustee
for, or any other representative of, such holders, and this Section 10.04 shall
not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that
no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto. In order to facilitate such a pledge or
assignment, the applicable Borrower shall, at the request of the assigning
Lender, duly execute and deliver to the

                                                                              61

assigning Lender a promissory note or notes evidencing the Loans made to such
Borrower by the assigning Lender hereunder.

          SECTION 10.05. EXPENSES; INDEMNITY. (a) Each Borrower agrees to pay
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
or in connection with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions
hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be
consummated) or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection
with the enforcement or protection of their rights in connection with this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with the Loans made
hereunder, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Cravath,
Swaine & Moore, counsel for the Administrative Agent, and, in connection with
any such enforcement or protection, the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of any other counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender
and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in
connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or any demand for payment thereunder. Each Borrower further agrees that
it shall indemnify the Lenders from and hold them harmless against any
documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any Governmental Authority by
reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.

          (b)  Each Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, each Lender and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents (each such person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all actual losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees,
charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee
arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution
or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (as defined in this
Agreement as in effect at any time prior to, on or after the date hereof; and as
any such Loan Document shall have been in effect at any time prior to, on or
after the date hereof) or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the
performance by the parties thereto of their respective obligations thereunder or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) the actual or
proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans (including Loans made prior to the
date hereof) or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party
thereto; PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of such Indemnitee.

          (c)  The provisions of this Section 10.05 shall remain operative and
in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Letters of Credit, the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts due under this
Section 10.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.

          SECTION 10.06. RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time

<Page>

                                                                              62

or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any
time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) which such Lender may have.

          SECTION 10.07. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

          SECTION 10.08. WAIVERS; AMENDMENT. (a) No failure or delay of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any
Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No
notice or demand on any Borrower in any case shall entitle such Borrower to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

          (b)  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders; PROVIDED, however, that
no such agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the
maturity of or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of
any interest on any Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part
thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan, without the prior written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) change or extend the Commitment or
decrease the Commitment Fees of any Lender or extend any payment date therefor
without the prior written consent of such Lender or (iii) amend or modify the
provisions of Section 2.16, the provisions of Article IX, the provisions of this
Section or the definitions of the terms "Required Lenders", "Borrowing Base",
"Available Art Loans", "Consolidated Net Tangible Assets" or "Net Post-2002
Investment" without the prior written consent of each Lender; PROVIDED FURTHER
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent.

          SECTION 10.09. INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate, together
with all fees and charges which are treated as interest under applicable law
(collectively the "CHARGES"), as provided for herein or in any other document
executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for, charged, received,
taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the
"MAXIMUM RATE") which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or
reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest
payable on the Loans of such Lender, together with all Charges payable to such
Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

          SECTION 10.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents constitute the entire contract between the parties relative to the
subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, expressed
or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto
and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

          SECTION 10.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each party hereto hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 10.11.

          SECTION 10.12. SEVERABILITY. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor
in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

          SECTION 10.13. JUDGMENT CURRENCY. (a) The Borrowers' obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in Dollars,
Sterling or Euros (the "OBLIGATION CURRENCY") shall not be discharged or
satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or
converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the
extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender of the full amount of the Obligation Currency
expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or
enforcing judgment against any Borrower or in any court or in any jurisdiction,
it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the
Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the
"JUDGMENT CURRENCY") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion
shall be made at the Sterling Equivalent, Euro Equivalent or Dollar Equivalent,
in the case of any Sterling, Euros or Dollars, and, in the case of other
currencies, the rate of exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if
the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by
a known dealer in such currency designated by the Administrative Agent)
determined, in each case, as of the date immediately preceding the day on which
the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the
"JUDGMENT CURRENCY CONVERSION DATE").

          (b)  If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between
the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the
amount due, the Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any judgment, such additional amounts,
if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may be

<Page>

                                                                              64

necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial
award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.

          (c)  For purposes of determining the Sterling Equivalent, Euro
Equivalent or Dollar Equivalent or rate of exchange for this Section, such
amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the
purchase of the Obligation Currency.

          SECTION 10.14. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which
when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 10.03.

          SECTION 10.15. HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

          SECTION 10.16. JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS. (a) Each
Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any
Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents against any Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

          (a)  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the other Loan
Documents in any New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

          (b)  Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

          SECTION 10.17. CONFIDENTIALITY. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 10.04(c), the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral
Agent and each of the Lenders agrees to keep confidential (and (i) to cause its
respective officers, directors and employees to keep confidential and (ii) to
use its best efforts to cause its respective agents and representatives to keep
confidential) the Information (as defined below) and all copies thereof,

<Page>

                                                                              65

extracts therefrom and analyses or other materials based thereon, except that
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or any Lender
shall be permitted to disclose Information (a) to such of its respective
affiliates, officers, directors employees, agents and representatives as need to
know such Information, (b) to the extent requested by any bank regulatory
authority, (c)(i) to the extent otherwise required by applicable laws and
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process or (ii) in connection
with the enforcement of this Agreement, (d) to the extent such Information (i)
becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement
or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other
than the Borrowers or (e) to the extent Holdings shall have consented to such
disclosure in writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, each party hereto agrees that the obligations of confidentiality
contained herein or otherwise undertaken in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS") shall not apply to the
"structure or the tax aspects," as that phrase is used In Section
1.6011-4T(a)(3) (or any successor provision) of the Treasury Regulations (the
"CONFIDENTIALITY REGULATION") promulgated under Section 6011 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, of such transactions; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Confidentiality Obligations nevertheless shall apply to any and all items of
information not required to be freely disclosable in order for the transaction
or transactions not to be treated as "offered under conditions of
confidentiality" within the meaning of the Confidentiality Regulation. For the
purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" shall mean all information that is
received from and relates to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries other than any
such information available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to its
disclosure thereto by Holdings or any such Subsidiary. The provisions of this
Section 10.17 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
the expiration of this Agreement.

          SECTION 10.18. RELEASE OF LIENS AND GUARANTEES. (a) Except as provided
in paragraph (b) below, no amendment to the Loan Documents that has the effect
of releasing all or substantially all the Collateral or any of the guarantees
under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreements or hereunder shall be effective except
pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers
and all the Lenders. It is expressly understood that an amendment providing that
additional obligations will be secured under the Security Documents will not
constitute a release of Collateral for purposes of this paragraph.

          (b)  In the event that Holdings or any Subsidiary sells, transfers or
otherwise disposes of all or any portion of any of the Equity Interests, assets
or property owned by Holdings or such Subsidiary in a transaction not prohibited
by this Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall
promptly (and the Lenders hereby authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Borrower to release any Liens created by any
Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests, assets or property, including
the release and satisfaction of record of any mortgage or deed of trust granted
in connection herewith, and, in the case of a disposition of all or
substantially all the Equity Interests or assets of any Subsidiary, to terminate
such Subsidiary's obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement and each
other Loan Document. In addition, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the Liens and security interests created by the Security Documents will
automatically terminate when all the Obligations have been paid in full and the
Commitments have been terminated, and the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent will take such actions as are reasonably requested by the
Borrower to evidence such termination. Holdings agrees to pay all out-of-pocket
