         the Seller's possession or control, or to which the Seller has access
         or may obtain and which are or may be used for the Property or use of

                                   ARTICLE 3
                                 Purchase Price

         3.1 PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price (the "PURCHASE PRICE") for which
Seller agrees to sell, convey, transfer and assign the Property to Purchaser and
which Purchaser agrees to pay or deliver to Seller for the Property is ONE
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($120,000,000.00), subject to the
terms of this Agreement, plus or minus the adjustments and prorations as
provided herein. The Purchase Price shall be paid in the manner immediately
hereafter provided.

         3.2 EARNEST MONEY. Purchaser shall, as a condition precedent to
Seller's obligations hereunder, make a deposit of Four Million Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand And No/100 Dollars ($4,750,000.00) in cash or other immediately
available good funds (the "EARNEST MONEY") with the Title Company (hereafter
defined) acting in its capacity as an escrow agent in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (the "ESCROW AGENT"). Purchaser shall deposit the Earnest
Money with Escrow Agent no later than two (2) Business Days (as hereafter
defined) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser and
Seller (the "EFFECTIVE DATE"). A "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean a day other than
Saturday, Sunday, or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New
York or the State of California are authorized or obligated by law or executive
order to be closed. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Earnest Money for the
purpose of securing the performance of Purchaser under the terms and provisions
of this Agreement in escrow in an interest bearing account pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement and such other terms and conditions as are reasonably
acceptable to the Seller, the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent. If the
transactions contemplated hereunder are not consummated in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Earnest Money shall be disbursed in accordance with the terms
set forth in this Agreement. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated in accordance with the terms hereof, the Earnest Money shall be
applied to the Purchase Price at Closing. Interest earned on the Earnest Money
shall follow the Earnest Money.

         3.3 CASH AT CLOSING. At Closing, Purchaser shall, subject to the
adjustments and prorations herein provided, deposit the balance of the Purchase
Price (computed by subtracting the Earnest Money, plus interest earned thereon,
from the amount of $120,000,000.00) with the Escrow Agent, by the payment of
cash, by federal wire transfer or in other immediately available good funds.

         3.4 PURCHASER'S LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. SELLER AND PURCHASER HAVE DISCUSSED
THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES TO SELLER IN THE EVENT THAT THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER FAIL TO CLOSE. SELLER AND PURCHASER HAVE DETERMINED AND
HEREBY AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE


                                       6
<Page>


IMPRACTICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIX THE ACTUAL DAMAGES TO SELLER OCCURRING
IN THE EVENT OF PURCHASER'S DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES HAVE MADE
DILIGENT BUT UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO ASCERTAIN THE ACTUAL COMPENSATORY DAMAGES
SELLER WOULD SUFFER IN THE EVENT OF PURCHASER'S NONPERFORMANCE HEREUNDER, AND
HEREBY AGREE THAT, AFTER NEGOTIATION, A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES IS
AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT PLUS TWO MILLION DOLLARS
($2,000,000) (THE "LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AMOUNT"). THEREFORE, BY EXECUTING THIS
AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES CONFIRM THE PRECEDING AND EVIDENCE THEIR AGREEMENT THAT
IN THE EVENT OF PURCHASER'S DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THAT SELLER SHALL BE
ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AMOUNT AS FULLY AGREED LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES AS ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AT LAW, AND THE EARNEST MONEY SHALL BE
RELEASED TO SELLER IN PARTIAL SATISFACTION OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AMOUNT.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY ABOVE, THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT LIMIT
PURCHASER'S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH HEREUNDER IN SECTIONS 5.1 (REVIEW
PERIOD INSPECTIONS), AND 16.2 (NO RECORDATION). THE PAYMENT OF THE LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES AMOUNT TO SELLER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A
FORFEITURE OR PENALTY, BUT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO
SELLER PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 1671, 1676 AND 1677.

         Purchaser's Initials                        Seller's Initials

         3.5 ALLOCATION. The Purchaser and the Seller shall mutually allocate
the Purchase Price among the items comprising the Property according to sound
accounting practices and such allocation will be finalized on or before the
Review Period Deadline and will thereafter be incorporated into a supplemental
instrument to be executed by the Purchaser and the Seller on or before Closing.
In the event of any inability of Seller and Purchaser to reach mutual agreement
as to allocation of the Purchase Price, it is further agreed that, in such
event, the parties will independently allocate the Purchase Price.

                                   ARTICLE 4
                                Title Deliveries

         4.1 TITLE ACTIONS. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the Review Period Deadline, Purchaser shall obtain the following, with
the cost and expense thereof to be paid in accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.6 hereunder:

                  (a) TITLE REPORT. A preliminary title report (the "TITLE
         REPORT") issued by the Chicago Title Company ("TITLE COMPANY"), setting
         forth the current status of the title to the Land and Improvements,
         showing all liens, claims, encumbrances, easements, rights of way,
         encroachments, reservations, restrictions, and any other matters
         affecting the Land and Improvements;

<Page>


                  (b) SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS. A true, complete, and legible copy
         of all documents and instruments (the "SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS") referred
         to or identified in the Title Report, including, but not limited to,
         all deeds and other conveyance documents evidencing transfer of title
         into the Seller, lien instruments not to be satisfied at Closing, if
         any, Leases, plats, surveys, reservations, restrictions, and easements;

                  (c) UCC SEARCH. A current written report (the "UCC SEARCHES")
         from the offices of the appropriate Governmental Authorities,
         reflecting the results of current searches of the Uniform Commercial
         Code Records maintained by such offices. Said UCC Searches are to be
         made under the names of Seller and all owners of the Property within
         five (5) years prior to the date of this Agreement (the "PREDECESSORS")
         and under all trade names used by Seller and Predecessors at the
         Property; and

                  (d) OTHER TITLE EVIDENCE. Such other evidence as Purchaser may
         require of Seller's title to the Vehicles identified on the Schedule of
         Vehicles and the Trademarks.

         4.2 SURVEY. Seller has obtained an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey (the
"SURVEY") of the Land and Improvements made on the ground and certified by Rick
Engineering Company (the "SURVEYOR"). If different from the descriptions
contained in EXHIBIT "A", attached to this Agreement, the legal description of
the Land contained in the Survey, once the correctness thereof has been
confirmed by Seller, Purchaser and the Title Company in writing, shall be the
description of the Land attached to the quitclaim deed delivered by Seller to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.2(b).

                                   ARTICLE 5
                      Documents, Inspecting and Objections

         5.1 INSPECTIONS. For the time period from the effective date of this
Agreement through the Review Period Deadline (the "REVIEW PERIOD") Seller shall,
after reasonable prior notice from Purchaser (so as to permit good faith
coordination efforts between Purchaser and Seller and to avoid undue
interference with either Purchaser's due diligence efforts or Seller's continued
operation of the Resort consistent with Seller's prior practices), give
Purchaser and Purchaser's agents and representatives reasonable access to the
Property during normal business hours and the right to physically inspect the
Property and to conduct soil tests, environmental tests and inspections, and
other tests and inspections (so long as such tests and inspections do not
unreasonably interfere with the use and occupancy of the Property by the Seller,
by guests or patrons of the Property, or by Tenants). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary above, if Purchaser proposes to make any tests in connection
with any environmental report or any other test which involves drilling, boring
or other similar intrusive or invasive action on or under the Property, then
Purchaser shall obtain Seller's written consent prior to making any such tests,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld provided that the scope of work
of any such proposed invasive testing will not cause any undue interference with
Seller's continued operation of the Resort consistent with Seller's prior
practices. Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate in good faith to coordinate
any such invasive testing so that it does not unduly delay Purchaser's due
diligence efforts or unduly interfere with Seller's continued operation of the
Resort consistent with its prior practices. Notwithstanding the preceding, and
so long as Purchaser complies with the confidential treatment of such
information as hereafter required, Purchaser's


                                       8
<Page>


indemnity obligation set forth below in this paragraph will not apply to the
mere discovery and reporting of any Hazardous Materials to any Governmental
Authority, as such may be required by applicable Laws. The costs and expenses of
Purchaser's investigation shall be born solely by Purchaser. Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all costs,
expenses, claims, liens, actions, suits, proceedings, damages and other
liabilities, including without limitation attorneys' fees and litigation
expenses, incurred by Seller and arising out of Purchaser's exercise of any
right to inspect the Property, with this foregoing indemnity obligation of the
Purchaser to survive Closing and any earlier termination of this Agreement.
Purchaser will use due care and prudence in the exercise of its rights of
inspection and will restore any physical damage or injury to the Property as
nearly as possible to the condition which existed immediately prior to the
inspections conducted by Purchaser pursuant to this Section. Subject to Section
16.1, all information furnished by Seller to Purchaser in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement or obtained by Purchaser in the course of its
investigations shall be treated as confidential information by Purchaser, except
that Purchaser may disclose such information as provided in Section 16.1 to
prospective investors and lenders of Purchaser or any assignee or prospective
assignee, to assignees or prospective assignees, to attorneys and other parties
assisting or representing Purchaser or assignees or prospective assignees in
connection with the subject transaction, and to others as may be permitted under
this Agreement or as required under the law. In addition, Purchaser may disclose
information it may acquire in connection with its examination of the
environmental condition of the Property as may be required by law, and may
disclose any information as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement. The foregoing restoration and confidentiality obligations of
Purchaser shall survive any early termination of this Agreement. Purchaser shall
maintain, and shall ensure its agents, consultants and contractors maintain
commercial general liability insurance and property damage insurance insuring
against any liability arising out of any entry, tests or investigations of the
Property pursuant to the provisions hereof. Such insurance shall be maintained
by Purchaser and/or its consultants, agents and contractors (as applicable) and
shall be in an amount of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined
single limit for injury or death of one or more persons in an occurrence, and
for damages to tangible property (including loss of use) in an occurrence. The
policy maintained by Purchaser shall insure the contractual liability of
Purchaser covering the indemnity herein and shall (a) name the Seller and the
Operator (hereafter defined) as additional insureds, (b) contain a
cross-liability provision, and (c) contain a provision that "the insurance
provided by Purchaser hereunder shall be primary and noncontributing with any
other insurance available to Seller." Purchaser shall provide Seller with
evidence of such insurance coverage prior to any entry, tests or investigations
of the Property.

         5.2 PROPERTY DOCUMENTS; SCHEDULES. Seller shall allow Purchaser
reasonable access, after reasonable prior notice to Seller, to the location or
locations where in the ordinary course of Seller's or Operator's operations
true, correct and complete copies of the following documents and information and
any and all other documents and information pertaining to the Property (or where
specifically indicated, original counterparts), together with all amendments,
modifications, renewals or extensions thereof, are maintained. Furthermore, if
the Property is purchased by Purchaser, all such documents and information shall
thereupon be and become the property of Purchaser without payment of any
additional consideration therefor; provided, however, in the event that the
Closing does not actually occur, Purchaser shall return such information to
Seller. Such documents and information shall include those more particularly
described as follows:

         marketable title to the Trademarks and all other Property; provided,
         however, that Seller shall not be deemed to make any representation in

                  (qq) To the Knowledge of Seller, the Improvements are
         structurally sound and free of material defects, and that Seller has
         not done and that it will not between now and the Closing Date do
         anything or suffer any act which would cancel, terminate, reduce or
         interfere with the validity, effectiveness or good standing of any
         existing warranties on the Improvements.

                  (rr) Seller has the full power, authority and all rights
         necessary to transfer and assign the Trademarks, the Software and the
         other Property to Purchaser and to carry out the terms and provisions
         of this Agreement.

                  (ss) The Trademarks listed on the Schedule of Trademarks are
         all of the Trademarks owned by Seller, Operator or any Affiliate or
         used with respect to the Resort. The Trademarks, the Software and the

         assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered and is, in all
         respects, free and clear of all encumbrances including, without
         limitation, interests, claims, options, prior assignments, licenses,
         leases, liens, charges or any other restrictions of any nature
         whatsoever.

                  (tt) Seller has no Knowledge of any fact that would prevent
         Purchaser's registration of the Trademarks with the United States
         Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") or any other state or foreign
         registry.

                  (uu) Purchaser's continued use of the Trademarks will not
         infringe the rights of any person or entity.

                  (vv) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.2(bb) hereto, there are

         clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, sufficient levels of
         china, linen, silver and glass (collectively, the "Big Four"),
         necessary and appropriate to operate a four-diamond rated resort ("Par
         Levels"). Schedule L to the Agreement sets forth an inventory of the
         Big Four currently owned by Purchaser and used in connection with the
         operation of the Resort. To the extent that the Big Four are
         insufficient to meet Par Levels currently or on the date of Closing,
         Seller agrees that Purchaser shall receive a credit to the Purchase
         Price in an amount equal to the cost of acquisition of the Big Four
         sufficient to meet Par Levels.

                  (xx) Seller is not subject to any agreement, judgment or order
         inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.

5.2(vv) or the covenant set forth in Section 8.14. The provisions of this
paragraph shall survive the Closing.

All representations and warranties by Seller in this Section 5.2 shall survive
Closing for a period of only one (1) year; provided, however, that if Purchaser
shall within said one (1) year period notify Seller in writing of any breach by
Seller of any such representations or warranties, then Purchaser shall be
entitled to avail itself of any and all remedies provided hereunder or in law or
in equity notwithstanding the expiration of said one (1) year period.

5:00 P.M., Carlsbad, California local time on October 31, 2001 (the "REVIEW

but subject to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser has elected to proceed

amended or replaced by any similar Law (collectively "CERCLA") or under any
other Law now or hereafter in effect pertaining to health, air pollution, water
pollution, noise control, waste transportation or disposal, industrial hygiene
or the environment (collectively, the "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS") and (bb) all other
matters of public record relating to the Property, whether imposed by, or in
favor of, any Governmental Authority or any private party (the "RESTRICTIONS";

"LEGAL REQUIREMENTS"); (iii) the terms, conditions and status of all Licenses;
(iv) the terms, conditions and status of all Service Contracts; (v) the terms,

Agreement shall, notwithstanding the foregoing, not affect the covenants,
agreements, warranties or representations of Seller in the Agreement or the

and effect in accordance with this Agreement.

<Page>


                  (a) PURCHASER'S ACCEPTANCE. In the event the Purchaser
         provides notice to Seller of Purchaser's election to proceed with this
         Agreement prior to the Review Period Deadline, then the sole obligation
         of the Seller with respect to the condition of the Property, but
         subject to the Seller's continuing obligations under the
         representations and warranties of Seller referenced in this Agreement,
         will be to deliver possession of the Property to Purchaser in the
         substantial condition (normal wear and tear and casualty loss excepted)
         which existed on the Review Period Deadline and Purchaser agrees to
         accept delivery of the Property on the Closing Date in an AS IS
         CONDITION, WITH ALL FAULTS, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AS TO
         FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE, except as otherwise provided in this
         Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and once
         again subject to the Seller's continuing obligations under the
         representations and warranties of Seller in this Agreement, and the
         covenants of Seller set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser hereby
         expressly waives and relinquishes, with such waiver and release to
         survive Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement, any and
         all claims, rights and remedies Purchaser may now or hereafter have
         against Seller, whether known or unknown, with respect to (i) any past,
         present or future presence or existence of Hazardous Materials on, in,
         under or about the Property, (ii) any past, present or future
         violations of CERCLA, and (iii) any Laws, Legal Requirements and
         Environmental Laws, now or hereafter enacted, regulating or governing
         the use, handling, storage or disposal of Hazardous Materials,
         including without limitation CERCLA or Section 25359.7 of the
         California Health and Safety Code. Additionally Purchaser acknowledges
         and agrees that the sole inquiry and investigation obligations of
         Seller as conducted in connection with the environmental condition of
         the Property will be to assist Purchaser in making a reasonable inquiry
         as to the status of the environmental condition of the Property and in
         further assisting Purchaser in all other reasonable respects in
         obtaining such environmental reports and investigations as Purchaser
         deems appropriate during the Review Period. For purposes of California
         Health and Safety Code Section 25359.7, Seller will as a result of the
         preceding be deemed to have acted reasonably and that Purchaser will
         have solely relied upon it's own inquiry and investigation.

                  (b) NATURAL HAZARD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT COMPLIANCE.
         Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that Seller may be required to
         disclose if the Property lies within the following natural hazard areas
         or zones: (i) a special flood hazard area designated by the Federal
         Emergency Management Agency (California Civil Code Section 1103(c)(1);
         (ii) an area of potential flooding (California Government Code Section
         8589.4); (iii) a very high fire hazard severity zone (California
         Government Code Section 51178, et. seq.); (iv) a wild land area that
         may contain substantial forest fire risks and hazards (Public Resources
         Code Section 4135); (v) an earthquake fault zone (Public Resources Code
         Section 2622); or (vi) a seismic hazard zone (Public Resources Code
         Section 2696) (sometimes all of the preceding are herein collectively
         called the "NATURAL HAZARD MATTERS"). Purchaser and Seller acknowledge
         that Seller has engaged or will engage at its expense the services of
         VISTA Information Solutions, Inc., as a natural hazard consultant and
         advisor, the selection of whom Purchaser hereby approves (who, in such
         capacity, is herein called the "NATURAL HAZARD EXPERT") to examine the
         maps and other information specifically made available to the public by
         government agencies for the purposes of enabling Seller to fulfill its
         disclosure obligations, if and to the extent such obligations

                                       17
<Page>

         exist, with respect to the natural hazards referred to in California
         Civil Code Section 1103 and to report the result of its examination to
         Purchaser and Seller in writing. The written report prepared by the
         Natural Hazard Expert regarding the results of its full examination
         will fully and completely discharge Seller from its disclosure
         obligations referred to herein, if and to the extent any such
         obligations exist, and, for the purpose of this Agreement, the
         provisions of Civil Code Section 1103.4 regarding non-liability of
         Seller for errors or omissions not within its personal knowledge shall
         be deemed to apply and the Natural Hazard Expert shall be deemed to be
         an expert, dealing with matters within the scope of its expertise with
         respect to the examination and written report regarding the natural
         hazards referred to above.

                  (c) PURCHASER'S RELEASE. PURCHASER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
         HAS READ AND IS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE
         SECTION 1542 ("SECTION 1542"), WHICH IS SET FORTH BELOW:

                  "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE
         CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF
         EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY
         AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

BY INITIALING BELOW, PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1542
SOLELY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE FOREGOING
WAIVERS AND RELEASES:

                                    --------------------

reflected in or concerning the Property Status Matters. If Purchaser shall so
notify Seller of any objections, Seller may elect to cure such objections. If
Purchaser, in Purchaser's sole discretion, is not satisfied with the results of
any cure efforts by Seller, or Seller is unable to or elects not to satisfy
Purchaser's objections, Purchaser may allow this Agreement to terminate on the
Review Period Deadline as provided in Section 5.3. In addition to the preceding,
in the event that this Agreement does not terminate on the Review Period
Deadline and the Seller has made a written offer to Purchaser, signed by an
officer of the Seller, to cure any objection to the Property made by Purchaser,
and such offer has been properly accepted in writing by an officer of the
Purchaser, such agreement shall become a part of this Agreement and failure of
Seller to cure such objections in accordance with Seller's written offer as
accepted by Purchaser will constitute a default by Seller under this Agreement;


                                       18

in no other event shall Seller be obligated to cure any objections of Purchaser.
In the event Purchaser allows this Agreement to terminate as provided in Section
5.3, neither party shall have any further rights or obligations to the other,
except for those obligations which are specifically identified as surviving
termination of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall affect the covenants,
agreements, warranties or representations of Seller in this Agreement or the
conditions to Purchaser's obligations, all of which shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 6
                              Permitted Exceptions

         6.1 PERMITTED EXCEPTIONS. Any test items or any other Property Status
Matters (subject to the terms of Section 5.3), which in any instance arose prior
to the Review Period Deadline and to which in any such instance the Purchaser
has not objected in accordance with Article 5, will be deemed approved and
accepted by Purchaser (sometimes herein referred to as the "PERMITTED
EXCEPTIONS"). In addition to Seller's obligations pursuant to Section 5.5
hereof, at Closing, Seller agrees that it shall remove from title to the
Property, at Seller's sole cost and expense, any mortgages, deeds of trust or
any other taxes, liens or assessments granted by Seller against the Resort or
suffered to be incurred by Seller against the Resort; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall limit the conditions to Purchaser's obligations set forth
in this Agreement or the obligations of Seller under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 7
                              Operation of Property

         7.1 INTERIM OPERATION. Seller hereby covenants and agrees that upon
execution of this Agreement, Seller, unless otherwise approved in writing by
Purchaser, shall:

                  (a) Subject to the terms of this Section 7.1, operate, manage,
         advertise, market and maintain the Property consistent with the
         Seller's prior practices and as a reasonable and prudent operator of
         like-kind property in the same competitive market would operate,
         manage, and maintain the Property, including, without limitation, (i)
         using reasonable efforts to keep available the services of its present
         employees of the Resort and to preserve its relations with guests,
         suppliers and other parties doing business with the Seller with respect
         thereto, (ii) accepting booking contracts for the use of the Resort on
         terms not less favorable than the terms typically arranged by the
         Seller as of the date of execution of this Agreement and retaining such
         bookings, (iii) maintaining the current level of advertising and other
         promotional activities for the Resort, and (iv) maintaining its books
         of accounts and records in its usual, regular and ordinary manner;

                  (b) Not commit waste of any portion of the Property;

                  (c) Keep and maintain the Property in a state of repair and
         condition substantially the same as it exists on the date of this
         Agreement (normal wear and tear and casualty loss excepted);

                  (d) Keep, observe, and perform, in all material respects, its
         obligations under the Licenses, the Leases, the FF&E Leases, the
         Service Contracts (including the


                                       19
<Page>


         Collective Bargaining Agreements), the Membership Contracts and all
         other applicable contractual arrangements relating to the Property;

                  (e) Not enter into any new Service Contracts, FF&E Leases,
         Membership Contracts, Leases or other contracts relating to the
         Property or any amendments, modifications, renewals or extensions of
         any existing thereof, convert any existing memberships under any of the
         Membership Contracts, or make any commitments regarding membership
         programs without Purchaser's prior written consent. Seller shall not
         modify, renew or extend the World Golf Championship Facilities
         Agreement with PGA Tour, Inc. and PGA Tours International Federation
         dated September 27, 1998 (the "TOURNAMENT AGREEMENT"), or enter into
         any new agreement providing for golf tournaments at the Property
         without Purchaser's prior written consent. Seller shall enforce each of
         such Service Contracts, FF&E Leases, Membership Contracts, Leases or
         any other contracts relating to the Property in the ordinary course of
         business and shall not terminate any of such agreements without
         Purchaser's prior written consent;

                  (f) Not cause or permit the removal of FF&E from the Property
         except for the purpose of discarding and replacing, where needed or
         appropriate, worn items, provided the same are replaced in the ordinary
         course of business, and timely making all repairs, maintenance, and
         replacements to keep the Property and all FF&E in substantially the
         same condition at the time of Closing as it is on the date of execution
         of this Agreement (normal wear and tear and casualty loss excepted);

                  (g) Keep Supplies adequately stocked, consistent with a
         four-diamond rated resort, as if the transfer of the ownership
         interests to the Property hereunder were not to occur, including
         without limitation, maintaining adequate turns of linens and bath
         towels, washcloths, soaps and sundries at current levels existing as of
         the date hereof for all guest rooms on the Property and china, glass,
         silverware and other like items at full operational complements;

                  (h) Not grant any bonus, free rent, rebate or other concession
         to any present or future Tenant, except consistent with Seller's prior
         practices, as if the transfer of the ownership interests to the
         Property hereunder were not to occur, or as permitted pursuant to
         Purchaser's prior written consent. Seller shall not institute any new,
         or extend any existing, promotions or group sales with respect to the
         Property without Purchaser's prior written consent;

                  (i) Advise Purchaser promptly of any material change to any of
         the Pending Claims or of any additional litigation, arbitration, or
         administrative hearing before any court or other Governmental Authority
         concerning or affecting the Property which to the Knowledge of the
         Seller is instituted or threatened after the date of execution of this
         Agreement or any change to any Schedules provided for in this
         Agreement;

                  (j) Not settle, compromise, waive or release any of the
         Pending Claims or any other litigation, arbitration, administrative
         dispute, claim or other manner of dispute which will affect the
         Property after the date of execution of this Agreement in a material
         adverse fashion, without Purchaser's prior consent;


                                       20
<Page>


                  (k) Not sell or assign or enter into any agreement to sell or
         assign, or to create or permit to exist any lien or encumbrance on, the
         Property or any portion thereof;

                  (l) Not allow any License, Trademark or any other right or
         agreement actually Known to Seller to be currently in existence with
         respect to the operation, use, occupancy or maintenance of the
         Property, to be canceled or otherwise expire or be terminated without
         Purchaser's prior written consent. Without limiting the foregoing,
         Seller shall renew its City of Carlsbad business license before the
         same expires and reinstate the license for the Spa Facility and pay any
         back fees which may be due in connection with the failure to have
         renewed such license or have operated the Spa Facility without such
         license;

                  (m) Not cancel any existing booking contracts for the use of
         Resort facilities or cancel any new booking contracts obtained by the
         Seller after the date of execution of this Agreement, except as is
         consistent with Seller's prior practices, as if the transfer of the
         ownership interests to the Property hereunder were not to occur;

                  (n) Pay or cause to be paid all taxes, assessments and other
         impositions levied or assessed on the Property or any part thereof or
         the operation of the Property;

                  (o) Keep the existing insurance coverage for the Property and
         the Seller in full force and effect;

                  (p) Acquire all right, title and interest in and to the
         Trademarks free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances prior
         to the Closing. Seller further agrees to obtain any and all necessary
         consents, releases, waivers, permits, approvals and authorizations from
         any previous owners of or interest holders in the Trademarks, and to
         make any and all filings with all federal, state and local government
         bodies which are necessary to consummate and record the transfer of the
         Trademarks to Purchaser as contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall
         obtain any and all consents, releases, waivers, approvals or
         authorizations of all other persons or entities as may be required for
         the sale, assignment and transfer to Purchaser of the Trademarks
         including without limitation, such consent as may be required under the
         March 3, 1993 Agreement between Lacoste Alligator, S.A. and Seller and
         a full release of claims from any prior owners of or interest holders
         in the Trademarks as required by Purchaser. Seller shall make all
         filings necessary to maintain all Trademark applications and
         registrations that may become due up to and including the 30th day
         after the Closing, and pay all associated fees. Seller shall not grant
         any license or transfer any rights whatsoever in any Trademark without
         the prior written consent of Purchaser. Seller shall not use or begin
         using any Trademark in any manner that infringes the rights of any
         third party, and shall immediately report any infringement or alleged
         infringement by Seller or by a third party; and

                  (q) Take all actions necessary to cause each of the warranties
         and representations in this Agreement to remain true and correct in all
         respects from the date hereof to the Closing Date and will refrain from
         taking any action which will cause, or threaten to cause, any of such
         warranties or representations to become incorrect or untrue


                                       21
<Page>


         at any time during such period, unless this Agreement contemplates the
         taking of such action and the modification of the applicable warranties
         or representations.

                                   ARTICLE 8
                                Special Covenants

         8.1 LIABILITY ASSUMPTION. At the Closing, Purchaser shall assume all of
the liabilities, obligations and expenses of Seller under the Service Contracts,
the Leases and the FF&E Leases and all liabilities, obligations and expenses
with respect to certain access, use and enjoyment rights of the services and
facilities of the Resort (including the Hotel) existing in favor of certain
prior owners of the Resort, their affiliates and their designees (the "MOLASKY
RIGHTS"), as more specifically described on Schedule M attached hereto and made
a part hereof, in each case that first arises from and after the Closing (the
obligations to be assumed by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence are referred to
collectively as the "ASSUMED LIABILITIES" and individually, as an "ASSUMED
LIABILITY"). At Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller from and against any
loss, claim, liability, cost, expense or demand, including attorney's fees and
litigation expenses actually incurred, arising out of any claim or claims under
any of the Assumed Liabilities arising after the Closing Date, and Seller shall
indemnify Purchaser and its successors and assigns against any and all loss,
claim, liability, cost, expense or demand, including attorney's fees and
litigation expenses actually incurred, arising out of any claim or claims under
any of the Assumed Liabilities arising prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall also assume the Pending Claims. Purchaser shall not be deemed to assume
any other liabilities, obligations or expenses relating to the Property or
arising out of any matter or undertaking which relates to the ownership, use,
maintenance or development of the Property, including, without limitation, any
expenses, obligations or liabilities with respect to any employees working at
the Property except for those obligations specifically assumed hereunder with
respect to the H.E.R.E. Collective Bargaining Agreement. The indemnification
obligations in this Section shall survive the Closing.

         8.2 STANDBY LOAN. In the event that the purchase and sale contemplated
hereunder shall not close solely as a result of a default by Purchaser
hereunder, then Purchaser shall provide to Seller an EIGHTY-FIVE MILLION AND
NO/100 DOLLARS ($85,000,000.00) loan to Seller, the proceeds of which will be
used by Seller for repayment of the current loan from Fuji Bank Ltd. which is
secured by the Property (the "FUJI DEBT") and satisfy any other debt of Seller
secured by the Property. Such loan shall be secured by a first priority
mortgage, lien and security interest in and to all of the Property (including,
without limitation, the Trademarks, which shall be required to be owned by
Seller) and the Encinitas Land. No other liens, pledges, encumbrances or
security interests shall be allowed on such collateral. The basic terms of such
loan shall be as set forth on EXHIBIT "C" attached hereto and made a part
hereof, provided that all other conditions, requirements and documentation shall
be satisfactory in form and substance to Purchaser and Seller and their
respective counsel. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that EXHIBIT "C" does not
contain all of the terms, covenants, conditions or requirements of Purchaser
with respect to such loan.

         8.3 LIQUOR LICENSES. Purchaser or its lessee or management company or
an affiliate of any one of those entities (the "PURCHASER'S OPERATOR") shall, at
its own cost and expense, pursue such license applications and other documents
as it may deem necessary for the Purchaser


                                       22
<Page>


or the Purchaser's Operator to obtain all licenses and/or permits with respect
to the Property (the "LIQUOR LICENSES") which are necessary to serve or sell
liquor, beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages (the "LIQUOR ASSETS") from any
restaurants, snack bars, bars, mini bars, lounges and other food or beverage
sales locations located within the Property. Seller shall reasonably cooperate,
without cost to Seller, with the Purchaser's Operator to obtain or transfer the
Liquor Licenses in order that the acquisition of the necessary Liquor Licenses
shall take effect on or immediately after the Closing Date. Such shall include
the possibility of entering into a Liquor Assets agreement prior to the Review
Period Deadline with the Seller's Operator, with such agreement to be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, Seller and Seller's Operator.
In the event that it is mutually determined that an additional escrow account
for the Liquor Assets is appropriate or necessary with respect to the preceding,
such escrow (the "LIQUOR ESCROW") shall be established in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.7(c)(vii) by Purchaser additionally depositing, with
adjustment to the Purchase Price, the appropriate amount with respect to the
Liquor Assets with the Escrow Agent, or another party mutually acceptable to
Seller and Purchaser, and with such deposit amount determined consistent with
the specifics set forth in the Liquor Asset Inventory.

         8.4 PROPERTY EMPLOYEES. Seller and Purchaser agree that employees of
the Property will be dealt with in the following manner:

                  (a) UNION EMPLOYEES. Purchaser acknowledges that certain
         employees working at the Property are employed pursuant to the terms
         and conditions of the following collective bargaining agreements: (a)
         that certain Collective Bargaining Agreement between Seller and
         Teamsters Local No. 542, effective July 1, 1997 - June 30, 2002; (b)
         that certain Collective Bargaining Agreement between Seller and Hotel
         Employees and Restaurant Employees Union of San Diego, Local 30
         ("H.E.R.E. Local 30"), covering the period between November 1, 1997 -
         April 30, 2002, as amended by that certain Agreement between Seller and
         H.E.R.E. Local 30, dated June 28, 1999 and that certain Contract
         Extension Agreement dated October 23, 2001 (the "H.E.R.E. COLLECTIVE
         BARGAINING AGREEMENT"); and (c) that certain Agreement between Seller
         and Laborers' International Union of North America, Local No. 89, dated
         May 22, 1997, extended through December 31, 2001 (collectively the
         "COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS"). Subject to the following,
         Purchaser agrees to assume the H.E.R.E. Collective Bargaining
         Agreement: (1) all obligations or liabilities under the H.E.R.E. Local
         30 Collective Bargaining Agreement based on any and all acts or
         occurrences after the date of Closing will be the obligations and
         liabilities of Purchaser; (2) all obligations or liabilities under the
         H.E.R.E. Collective Bargaining Agreement based on any and all acts or
         occurrences up to and including the date of Closing shall remain the
         sole responsibility of Seller, except for pension or other retirement
         plan contributions, vacation pay and any sick pay/attendance bonus for
         which Purchaser shall receive a corresponding credit therefor on a
         prorata basis. Purchaser shall not assume the other two Collective
         Bargaining Agreements or any obligations arising thereunder, including
         any employee benefit plans. Seller shall terminate the employment of
         all H.E.R.E. Local 30 Union Employees effective 11:59 p.m. on the day
         before the Closing Date (it being understood that if for any reason the
         closing does not occur that such termination shall be deemed void).
         Purchaser shall, effective as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date (it
         being understood that if, for any reason the Closing does not occur,
         such hiring shall be deemed void), employ all H.E.R.E. Local 30 Union
         Employees. Other than as specifically set forth above as to the
         H.E.R.E. Local 30 Union employees, Purchaser will not assume any debts,
         obligations,


                                       23
<Page>


         responsibilities, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments, or
         settlements arising from any Employee Benefit Plans, contracts or
         agreements, or arising out of or relating to Seller's operation of the
         business, sale of the assets, termination of Seller's employees, or any
         other employment-related matter involving Seller, including, but not
         limited to Seller's violation of any federal, state or local laws; any
         such debts, obligations, responsibilities, liabilities, claims,
         damages, judgments or settlements contemplated hereunder shall be the
         sole and exclusive responsibility of Seller.

                  (b) I-9 FORMS. As to the H.E.R.E. Local 30 Union Employees,
         Seller shall provide Purchaser the I-9 Forms the Seller obtained and
         maintained for those employees.

                  (c) OTHER EMPLOYEES. Other than as set forth in (a) above,
         Purchaser intends to hire its workforce on the terms and conditions it
         chooses to establish. Seller shall terminate the employment of all
         other employees effective as of 11:59 p.m. on the day before the
         Closing Date (it being understood that if for any reason the Closing
         does not occur that such termination shall be deemed void). Purchaser
         shall have no obligation to employ those individuals. Purchaser will
         not assume any debts, obligations, responsibilities, liabilities,
         claims, damages, judgments, or settlements arising from any Employee
         Benefit Plans, contracts or agreements, or arising out of or relating
         to Seller's operation of the business, sale of the assets, termination
         of Seller's employees, or any other employment-related matter involving
         Seller, including, but not limited to Seller's violation of any
         federal, state or local laws; any such debts, obligations,
         responsibilities, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments or
         settlements contemplated hereunder shall be the sole and exclusive
         responsibility of Seller. However, Purchaser agrees to assume any
         obligations or liabilities to those individuals that arise under the
         Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101 et.
         seq. (the "WARN Act") due to their termination of employment.

                  (d) COBRA Obligations and Contributions. After Closing Seller
         shall maintain or reestablish group health plans for the purpose of
         satisfying any COBRA obligations to all employees. In the event that
         Seller fails to do so, then Seller agrees to hold harmless and
         indemnify Purchaser from any and all costs, including legal fees and
         expenses, incurred by Purchaser related to any COBRA obligations to
         those employees. In the event that Purchaser does not offer employment
         to any employee terminated by Seller pursuant to this Section 8.4 who
         was covered by a health plan maintained by Seller and who timely elects
         COBRA coverage under that plan, then upon proof of COBRA coverage by
         Seller and election by the employee Purchaser shall pay $1,000.00 to
         Seller as a contribution toward that employee's continuation coverage
         premiums under that plan.

                  (e) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. "Employee Benefit Plans" means
         each employment, collective bargaining or consulting contract or each
         deferred compensation, profit-sharing, pension, bonus, stock option,
         stock purchase or other fringe benefit or compensation contract,
         commitment, arrangement or plan ( whether written or oral), including
         each plan as defined in sections 3(3) or 3(37)(A) of the Employee
         Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), which
         Seller has established or maintained, or under which Seller has an
         obligation to make contributions or to pay benefits for the benefit of
         persons who are, were or will become entitled to such benefits in
         accordance with the terms of the plan as employees,


                                       24
<Page>


         former employees, retirees, directors, or independent contractors (or
         their dependents, spouses or beneficiaries) of Seller or its
         predecessor in interest or any employer which would constitute an ERISA
         Affiliate. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "ERISA Affiliate"
         includes all employers (whether or not incorporated) which by reason of
         common control are treated together with Seller as a single employer
         within the meaning of IRC section 414. Except as otherwise provided
         herein, Seller will make all contributions required under the terms of
         any Employee Benefit Plan, including those established or maintained in
         accordance with the provisions of any employee contracts or collective
         bargaining agreements and shall bear any withdrawal or other liability
         associated therewith. Seller will pay or otherwise satisfy in a timely
         fashion all obligations and liabilities accrued under or related to any
         of such Employee Benefit Plans.

                  (f) OTHER EMPLOYMENT MATTERS. Seller and Purchaser further
         agree that: (i) Seller and Purchaser will approve a formula or method
         to be used for determining the above referenced Closing proration
         credits with respect to the H.E.R.E. Local 30 Union Employee
         Liabilities which arose prior to the Closing Date; (ii) the Seller will
         not before or after the Review Period Deadline (aa) amend the
         Collective Bargaining Agreements or enter into any new employment
         arrangements (including any new collective bargaining agreement or

interference with either Purchaser's due diligence efforts or Seller's continued
operation of the Resort consistent with its prior practices) have reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to all executive staff at the Property, to
all Records, Financial Statements and to other books and information in the

                  such uncredited Accounts Payable to Seller for Seller's
                  approval. If Seller does not notify Purchaser within five (5)
                  days of receipt of such item of Seller's disapproval thereof,

                  Seller determines not to approve the uncredited Accounts
                  Payable, Seller shall so notify Purchaser in writing and then
                  Seller shall be solely responsible for such uncredited
                  Accounts Payable. In no event shall Purchaser be deemed to
                  assume uncredited Accounts Payable. If the amount of
                  uncredited Accounts Payable paid by Purchaser exceeds $250,000
                  prior to six (6) months after Closing (or such extended
                  period), Seller shall promptly reimburse Purchaser for such
                  entire amount. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser on or before
                  six (6) months after Closing for all remaining uncredited
                  Accounts Payable; and


                                       36

                           (x) Annual permits and/or inspection fees (calculated

                  other expenses normal to the operation and maintenance of the
                  Property.

                  (c) CASH, DEPOSITS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, BANK ACCOUNTS, AND
         SPECIAL ADJUSTMENTS. In addition to the allocations and prorations
         provided for in Section 9.7(b) above, the following amounts shall be
         credited to Seller or to Purchaser, as provided below:

                           (i) Utility deposits made by Seller, which are
                  credited or transferred to the account of Purchaser by the

                  Seller at Closing;

                           (ii) Prepaid Deposits for any guest reservations or
                  events occurring after the Closing, net of any commissions or
                  other expenses incurred in booking such events which were paid
                  by Seller prior to the Closing, shall be transferred to
                  Purchaser without adjustment to the Purchase Price;

                           (iii) Deposits made by Seller with any Governmental

                  Property conveyed to Purchaser shall, to the extent
                  assignable, be assigned to Purchaser and credited to Seller at
                  the Closing;

                           (iv) Amounts required to satisfy all outstanding gift

                  liabilities of the Property), shall be mutually agreed upon by

         Closing; and

                  (bb) All gift, barter or "script" certificates bearing an
         expiration date and which can expire under applicable law will be

                  been delivered by Seller to the credit card companies (net of
                  fees payable in connection with the processing of credit card
                  charges) (herein referred to as "CREDIT CARDS"), plus (ii) 95%
                  of the total amount of the Membership Accounts Receivable,
                  plus (iii) 70% of the amount of all other Accounts Receivable

                  and reassignment: (x) there shall be no reconciliation or
                  reassignment of the Membership Accounts Receivable, (y) on the
                  date that is three months after the Closing Date and again on
                  the date that is six months after the Closing Date, Purchaser
                  shall pay Seller any amounts received by Purchaser from and
                  after the Closing Date on account of the Credit Cards and the
                  Non-Membership Accounts Receivable in excess of the payment
                  Seller receives at the Closing for the Credit Cards and
                  Non-Membership Accounts Receivable (or, with respect to the
                  six-month reconciliation, in excess of payments received by
                  Seller at the Closing and at the three-month reconciliation),
                  and (y) upon completion of the six-month reconciliation, if it
                  is determined that Seller has received payments on account of
                  Credit Cards and Non-Membership Accounts Receivable greater
                  than amounts collected by Purchaser after the Closing with
                  respect thereto, then Seller shall promptly reimburse
                  Purchaser for such excess amounts. At the three-month
                  reconciliation and the six month reconciliation, Purchaser
                  shall provide an


                                       38

                  itemization and reconciliation of all receipts by Purchaser.
                  Purchaser shall re-assign to Seller the right to collect any
                  Credit Cards and Non-Membership Accounts Receivable remaining
                  unpaid as of such date. After the reconciliations made
                  pursuant to the preceding sentence, there shall be no further
                  adjustment between Seller and Purchaser with respect to
                  Accounts Receivable. All Accounts Receivable arising from a
                  Gap Membership Contract, pursuant to Section 9.7(b)(iv), will
                  be assigned to Purchaser at Closing and shall remain the
                  property of the Purchaser and will not be subject to the
                  prorations provided above.

                           (vii) At Closing Purchaser shall, subject to prior
                  depletion or consumption in the ordinary course of operation
                  of the Resort and replacement in the ordinary course of
                  business, receive possession of all items identified on the
                  FF&E Inventory and the Supply Inventory without adjustment to
                  the Purchase Price, provided that: (aa) if Purchaser notifies
                  Seller no later than five (5) business days prior to the
                  Closing Date in writing of Purchaser's specific rejection of
                  any items contained in the Supplies then, in such event,
                  Seller will retain each such rejected item, remove such
                  rejected item from the Property by Closing and the Purchase
                  Price will not be adjusted by the cost thereof and (bb) in the
                  event the Liquor Escrow has been established with respect to
                  the Liquor Assets, then the Purchase Price will be adjusted,
                  but the Purchaser will be entitled after Closing to receive
                  any funds thereafter released from the Liquor Escrow; and

                           (viii) All existing bank accounts of Seller shall be
                  retained by Seller and closed out by Seller in due course;
                  Purchaser shall open and fund its own bank accounts;

                  (d) SALES TAXES. All sales, use and occupancy taxes, if any,
         due or to become due in connection with revenues received from the
         Property for the period prior to the time of Closing will be paid by
         Seller. Purchaser shall be liable to pay all such sales, use and
         occupancy taxes due or to become due in connection with revenues for
         the period on and after the time of Closing. Seller and Purchaser shall
         each pay their respective share of all sales, use and occupancy taxes
         due or to become due in connection with revenues apportioned between
         Seller and Purchaser as provided in this Section. On or prior to the
         Closing, Seller shall obtain an Escrow Clearance from the California
         State Board of Equalization confirming that Purchaser will not have any
         liability for any sales taxes for the period prior to the Closing.

                  (e) BIG FOUR. At Closing Purchaser shall receive such credit
         against the Purchase Price, if any, as is required under Section
         5.2(ww).

                  (f) CAPITAL LEASES. At Closing, Purchaser shall receive a
         credit against the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the amount of
         all obligations under capital leases of equipment or FF&E at the
         Property from the Closing Date through the expiration thereof,
         including any amounts payable under purchase options or buy-outs at the
         end of the lease contained therein.

<Page>


                  (g) SOFTWARE LICENSES. At Closing Purchaser shall receive a
         credit against the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the amount
         necessary to be paid to renew the Licenses relating to any Software
         listed on the Schedule of Software.

                  (h) REMOVAL OF MONETARY ENCUMBRANCES. Purchaser may at Closing
         direct the Escrow Agent to satisfy from the Purchase Price the Fuji
         Debt and any other mechanic's liens, outstanding taxes or assessments
         or other liens against the Property which are not accepted by Purchaser
         pursuant to this Agreement and were created by or on behalf of the
         Seller, and Purchaser shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price
         therefor.

                  (i) SURVIVAL. All obligations of Purchaser and Seller which by
         the terms of this Section 9.7 are to be performed following the Closing
         shall survive the Closing.

         9.8 RECONCILIATION AND FINAL PAYMENT. A preliminary schedule of the
prorations and closing adjustments provided for hereunder shall be initially
prepared by Purchaser and submitted to Seller for review and approval, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Once finalized, such adjustment and
prorations shall be incorporated into the Closing Memorandum. In the event,
however, that any of such prorations or adjustments cannot be calculated
accurately by Closing, then Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate
after Closing to make a final determination of the prorations and adjustments
required hereunder within six (6) months of Closing. Upon the final
reconciliation of the prorations and adjustments, the party which owes the other
party any sums hereunder shall pay such party such sums, together with interest
thereon at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from Closing to the date of
payment. Such payment shall be made within ten (10) days after the
reconciliation of such sums. In any event, Seller and Purchaser shall pay their
own costs and expenses in preparation of the preliminary schedule and any costs
and expense of any accountant as above provided shall be paid equally between
Seller and Purchaser. The obligations to calculate such prorations, make such
reconciliations and pay any such sums shall survive the Closing.

         9.9 LIABILITY ESCROW. On the Closing Date, Escrow Agent shall retain
the sum of $7,000,000.00 from Seller's proceeds and create an escrow (the
"LIABILITY ESCROW"). Escrow Agent shall establish the Liability Escrow, and
shall handle and disburse the funds held therein, in accordance with a liability
escrow agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
Seller, which shall generally provide that the Liability Escrow shall be held
and disbursed as provided in this Section 9.9. The Liability Escrow shall be
security for Seller's payment of any liability to Purchaser arising following
the Closing for breaches of covenants, warranties, representations or
obligations of Seller under this Agreement and the performance of any
post-closing obligations of Seller set forth in this Agreement (the "CONTINUING
OBLIGATIONS"). In the event that Purchaser on or before the date that is one (1)
year following the Closing Date asserts the existence of a Continuing Obligation
of Seller, it shall give prompt written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent
specifying the nature and amount of the claim asserted. If Seller, within thirty
(30) days after receiving such notice from Purchaser, shall not give written
notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent announcing its intent to contest such
claim, such assertion shall be deemed accepted by Seller and Escrow Agent shall
pay to Purchaser the amount of such claim from the Liability Escrow. In the
event, however, that Seller contests the assertion of the claim by giving a
written notice to Purchaser and Escrow Agent within such thirty (30) day period,
then if Purchaser and Seller, acting in good faith, cannot reach agreement with
respect to such


                                       40
<Page>


claim within sixty (60) days after such notice is first given to Seller, such
parties may seek any remedy available to them at law or in equity. In the event
that it is determined following the pursuit of such remedies that Seller is
responsible for payment of any such claim to Purchaser, then Purchaser shall be
entitled to receive from Escrow Agent the amount thereof from the Liability
Escrow, regardless of whether such determination is made within such one (1)
year period or not. On the date which is one (1) year following the date of the
Closing Date, Escrow Agent shall pay to Seller the amount remaining in the
Liability Escrow, as such amount has been reduced by the amount of any claims
that have been accepted by Seller as valid claims or which have otherwise been
determined to be valid claims, and by the amount of any claims which are the
subject of a contest as to whether such claims are valid or not. In the event it
is determined following the expiration of such one (1) year period that any
pending claim was not a valid obligation of Seller, Escrow Agent shall promptly
pay to Seller the amount of such disputed claim from the Liability Escrow.

                       Conditions Precedent to the Closing

         11.1 PURCHASER'S CONTINGENCIES. In addition to any other conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Purchaser's obligations to consummate the Closing are
subject to the timely satisfaction of, and contingent upon, Purchaser's written
approval or written waiver of the following conditions and requirements on or
before the Closing Date (the "PURCHASER'S CONTINGENCIES"), which shall be
conditions precedent to Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement. Should the
Purchaser's Contingencies not be satisfied on or before the Closing Date, the
Purchaser will be entitled to either waive the same in writing or to terminate
this Agreement and receive the Earnest Money. Purchaser's Contingencies are as
follows:

         acquisition of that certain 4.3 acre tract of real property located in
         the City of Encinitas, County of San Diego, California (commonly known

         set forth in an Agreement for the Purchase and Sale of Real Estate
         between Encinitas Resort Corporation, as seller, and the Purchaser or
         its designee or assignee, dated contemporaneously herewith (the

         to occur for any reason other than Purchaser's or its designee's or
         assignee's default following execution and delivery of the Encinitas
         Contract, and this Agreement is terminated as herein provided, then the
         Earnest Money hereunder will be paid to Purchaser. On the occurrence of
         such default by Purchaser or its designee or assignee resulting in a
         termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(a), Seller
         will be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under Section 3.4
         above.

                  (c) REPRESENTATIONS. The truth and accuracy, as of the date of
         this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, of each and every warranty
         or representation made herein by Seller which for purposes of this
         subparagraph, it shall be assumed that each and every warranty and

         and not limited to Seller's Knowledge.

                  (d) NO SELLER DEFAULT. Seller shall duly perform each and

         premium required to be paid by Purchaser under this Agreement, of a
         Form B-1970 Extended Owner's Title Policy (the "TITLE POLICY") on the
         most recent form of ALTA extended coverage owner's policy, all of which
         shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser in all
         material respects, with the Title Policy containing such material
         endorsements and direct access reinsurance agreements as Purchaser may
         require. In addition, Purchaser shall have received a final Survey
         which shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser in all
         material respects.

                  (g) SCHEDULES. All Schedules shall have been accurate and
         complete when made or delivered. Without limiting the terms of Section
         11(c) above, there shall be no matters not disclosed on any Schedule
         hereto which should have been disclosed on a Schedule which are not
         acceptable to Purchaser in its sole discretion.

                  (h) SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS. As of Closing, Purchaser shall
         not object to any material matter disclosed by Seller to Purchaser

         restaurants, bars and lounges presently located on the Property,
         including, without limitation, the Liquor Licenses. To that end, Seller
         and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other, and each shall execute
         such transfer forms, license applications and other documents as may be
         necessary or desirable for Purchaser or its designees to maintain or
         obtain such Licenses, permits, approvals and other authorizations.

         11.2 SELLER'S CONTINGENCIES. In addition to any other condition set
forth in this Agreement, Seller's obligations to consummate the Closing are
subject to the timely satisfaction of, and contingent upon, Seller's written
approval or written waiver of each and every one of the conditions and
requirements set forth in this Section on or before the dates indicated (the
"SELLER'S CONTINGENCIES"), all of which shall be conditions precedent to
Seller's obligations under this Agreement. Should any of Seller's Contingencies
not be satisfied, the Seller will be entitled to either waive the same in
writing or to terminate this Agreement. Seller's Contingencies are as follows:

                  (a) ENCINITAS CLOSING. The closing of the Encinitas Contract
         fails to occur by reason of a default by Purchaser or its designee or
         assignee under the Encinitas Contract. Upon such default, Seller will
         be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under Section 3.4
         above.

                                   ARTICLE 12
                            Casualty and Condemnation

         12.1 CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION. In the event of actual or threatened
condemnation or damage to or destruction of all or any part of the Property
prior to the Closing Date, it is agreed as follows:

                  (a) MINOR LOSS. If the value of the Property which is subject
         of the condemnation or insured casualty loss is not more than One
         Million Dollars ($1,000,000), this Agreement will continue, all
         condemnation or insurance proceeds collectible by reason of such taking
         or damage will be absolutely payable to the Purchaser, the Purchase
         Price will be reduced by the sum of any deductible amount under any
         insurance claim, any uninsured amount or the amount of any
         uncollectible insurance claim, and the sale of the Property will be
         otherwise closed in accordance with this Agreement.

                  (b) MAJOR LOSS. If the value of the Property which is the
         subject of the condemnation or casualty loss is more than One Million
         Dollars ($1,000,000) or the casualty loss is not insured, the Purchaser
         will have the option for ten (10) business days after receipt of
         written notice of such taking or destruction (which notice shall be
         promptly given by Seller) to cancel this Agreement by service of
         written notice of cancellation. On the exercise of such option, this
         Agreement will become null and void, and the Earnest Money will be
         returned to the Purchaser. If, in such event, the Purchaser does not
         affirmatively exercise the option to cancel this Agreement, such option
         will lapse, the Purchaser will be entitled to receive all condemnation
         or insurance proceeds collectible by reason of such taking or
         destruction, the Purchase Price will be reduced by the sum of any
         deductible amount under any insurance claim, any uninsured amount or
         the amount of any uncollectible insurance claim, and the sale of the
         Property will be otherwise closed in accordance with this Agreement.

                              Default and Remedies

         13.1 PURCHASER'S DEFAULT. If for any reason other than termination
hereof pursuant to any right of termination specifically granted to Purchaser
hereunder, or except as excused by a default by Seller or a default by Encinitas
Resort Corporation under the Encinitas Contract (i) Purchaser refuses or fails
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) Purchaser or its
designee or assignee fails to perform any of its obligations under the Encinitas
Contract, or (iii) if any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of
Purchaser herein shall have been materially incorrect when made; then Seller may
make written demand for performance by Purchaser. If Purchaser fails to comply
with such written demand within ten (10) business days after receipt thereof,
then Seller shall have the right to: (a) terminate this Agreement by giving
Purchaser and Escrow Agent written notice thereof; and (b) exercise its right to
liquidated damages under Section 3.4 above as its sole remedy. On such
termination neither party shall have any further rights, duties or obligations
hereunder (except to the extent this Agreement may specifically provide for the
survival of certain obligations of Seller or Purchaser) and Seller shall be
entitled to receive liquidated damages under Section 3.4 above. Seller and
Purchaser hereby acknowledge that, as above agreed, the amount of damages
resulting from a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser would be difficult or
impossible to accurately ascertain, and the Escrow Agent shall immediately
deliver the Earnest Money to Seller in partial satisfaction of the Liquidated
Damages Amount.

         13.2 SELLER'S DEFAULT.

                  (a) SELLER'S PRE-CLOSING DEFAULT. If for any reason other than
         termination hereof pursuant to a right granted to Seller hereunder to
         do so or except as excused by a default by Purchaser (i) Seller refuses
         or fails to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, or
         (ii) Encinitas Resort Corporation fails to perform any of its
         obligations under the Encinitas Contract, (iii) any representation or
         warranty made by or on behalf of Seller herein shall have been
         materially incorrect when made or when reaffirmed at Closing; then
         Purchaser may make written demand for performance by Seller. If Seller
         fails to comply with such written demand within ten (10) business days
         after receipt thereof, then Purchaser may elect to either (a) proceed
         against Seller by bringing an action for specific performance under
         this Agreement and/or (b) terminate this Agreement in which event the
         Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser and, to thereafter
         maintain a cause of action for damages against Seller for recovery of
         such amounts as to which Purchaser may prove to be entitled, provided
         however, notwithstanding anything hereunder to the contrary, Purchaser
         agrees Purchaser will not be entitled to seek or collect any damage
         award or awards resulting from Seller's default under this Agreement
         and Encinitas Resort Corporation's default under the Encinitas Contract
         which, on a cumulative basis, exceed the sum of SEVEN MILLION AND
         NO/100 DOLLARS ($7,000,000.00) and no other damage amounts in excess
         thereof against Seller or Encinitas Resort Corporation shall be
         collectible, enforceable or otherwise available to Purchaser. In the
         event that the Encinitas Resort Corporation fails to perform any of its
         obligations under the Encinitas Contract, Purchaser may adjourn the
         Closing Date hereunder for such period of time as the purchaser under
         the Encinitas Contract may require to obtain the performance by
         Encinitas Resort Corporation of its


                                       45
<Page>


         obligations under the Encinitas Contract. Notwithstanding anything to
         the contrary above, the foregoing shall not limit Seller's or Encinitas
         Resort Corporation's indemnity obligations set forth in this Agreement,
         the Encinitas Contract or in any agreement delivered at Closing or at
         the closing under the Encinitas Contract.

                  (b) Seller's Post-Closing Default. If Purchaser purchases the
         Property, Purchaser agrees that with respect to any and all defaults by
         Seller under this Agreement, including without limitation any default
         or breach with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or
         indemnity of Seller set forth in this Agreement, that Purchaser will
         not be entitled to seek or collect any damage award or awards resulting
         from Seller's default under this Agreement and Encinitas Resort
         Corporation's default under the Encinitas Contract which, on a
         cumulative basis, exceeds the sum of SEVEN MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS
         ($7,000,000.00) and no other damage amounts in excess thereof against
         Seller or the Encinitas Resort Corporation shall be collectable,
         enforceable or otherwise available to Purchaser. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary above, the foregoing shall not limit Seller's
         or Encinitas Resort Corporation's indemnity obligations set forth in
         this Agreement, the Encinitas Contract or in any agreement delivered at
         Closing or at the closing under the Encinitas Contract.

                  (c) Purchaser further agrees that under no circumstances
         (whether any default occurs prior to or after the Closing) shall
         Purchaser be entitled to recover any consequential or punitive damages.

Any address or name specified above maybe changed by a notice given to the other
party. Unless otherwise stated herein, any notice, demand or other communication
shall be deemed given and effective as of the date of receipt. The inability to
deliver because of changed address of which no notice was given, or rejection or
other refusal to accept any notice, demand or other


                                       47
<Page>


communication, shall be deemed to be receipt of the notice, demand or other
communication as of the date of such attempt to deliver or rejection or refusal
to accept. Notices, demands and other communications may be given by the
parties' counsel which shall have the same force and effect as if given by the
parties themselves.

         15.2 ENTIRE AGREEMENT, MODIFICATIONS AND WAIVERS, CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.
This Agreement constitutes (and the Encinitas Contract if and when executed and
delivered will constitute) the entire agreement between the parties hereto and
thereto and may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto and thereto, and no provisions or conditions may be
waived other than by a written document signed by the party benefited by such
provision waiving such provisions or conditions. No delay or omission in the
exercise of any right or remedy accruing to Seller or Purchaser upon any breach
under this Agreement shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a
waiver of any such breach theretofore or thereafter occurring. The waiver by
Seller or Purchaser of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein
stated shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach, or of a
subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or condition herein
contained.

         15.3 EXHIBITS. All exhibits referred to in this Agreement and attached
hereto are hereby incorporated in this Agreement by reference.

         15.4 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The rights of the Purchaser under this
Agreement may be assigned without the prior written consent of the Seller. In
the event of any such assignment, such assignment shall release the entity
originally named as the Purchaser in this Agreement from continuing liability
for the performance of the obligations of the Purchaser hereunder and each
assignee of the Purchaser by accepting such assignment will be bound by the
terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if the assignee had been the
person originally named as the Purchaser in this Agreement. Furthermore, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of Seller and
Purchaser and their respective legal representatives, successors, and permitted
assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, Seller shall
not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which
Purchaser may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.

         15.5 ARTICLE AND SECTION HEADINGS. Article and section headings and
Article and Section numbers are inserted herein only as a matter of convenience
and in no way define, limit or prescribe the scope or intent of this Agreement
or any part thereof and shall not be considered in interpreting or construing
this Agreement.

         15.6 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is being delivered and is intended
to be performed in Carlsbad, San Diego County, California. This Agreement is to
be construed according to the internal laws of the State of California
applicable to contracts to be performed entirely within the State of California,
by parties who are residents of the State of California. All actions with
respect to this Agreement will be instituted in the courts of the State of
California or the United States District Court sitting in San Diego, California.
By execution of this Agreement, the parties irrevocably and unconditionally
submit to the jurisdiction (both subject matter and personal) of any such court
and irrevocably and unconditionally waive: (a) any objection any party might now
or hereafter have to the venue in any such court; and (b) any


                                       48
<Page>


claim that any action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

         15.7 TIME PERIODS. If the final day of any time period or limitation
set out in any provision of this Agreement falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal
holiday under the laws of the State where the Property is located or of the
federal government, then and in such event the time of such period shall be
extended to the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Time
is of the essence in this Agreement.

         15.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by either party hereto on a separate counterpart, each of which
when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original and all of which
taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

         15.9 SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements and indemnities contained in
the Agreement which either specify performance after earlier termination of this
Agreement or performance after the Closing Date, shall survive. All
representations and warranties referenced or contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing for a period of only one (1) year (subject to the provisions
of this Agreement regarding the bringing of claims with respect thereto). None
of the foregoing shall be deemed to merge into, or be waived by any closing
documents.

         15.10 FURTHER ACTS. In addition to the acts, deeds, instruments and
agreements recited herein and contemplated to be performed, executed and
delivered by Purchaser or Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall perform, execute
and deliver or cause to be performed, executed and delivered at the Closing or
after the Closing, any and all further acts, deeds, instruments and agreements
and provide such further assurances as the other party or the Title Company may
reasonably require to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder.
However, the foregoing shall not be deemed to (a) require Seller to expend a sum
of money which it could not reasonably have anticipated on the date of execution
of this Agreement, or (b) require Purchaser to expend a sum of money which it
could not reasonably have anticipated on the expiration of the Review Period.

         15.11 SEVERABILITY. In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein.

         15.12 ATTORNEYS' FEES. Should either party employ an attorney or
attorneys to enforce any of the provisions hereof or to protect its interest in
any manner arising under this Agreement, the non-prevailing party in any action
pursued in a court of competent jurisdiction (the finality of which is not
legally contested) agrees to pay to the prevailing party all reasonable costs,
damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred or
expended in connection therewith.

                                 Confidentiality

         16.1 CONFIDENTIALITY. Except as otherwise provided herein, Purchaser
and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to not disclose the terms of this
Agreement or the Encinitas Contract prior to the Close of Escrow to any person
or entity not a party to this Agreement prior to Closing; provided that nothing
in this Section 16.1 shall prohibit the disclosure of the existence of this
Agreement, the possibility of the transactions contemplated hereunder, or the
disclosures and contacts with employees, union representatives, government
officials and others contemplated by this Agreement. Except to the extent
otherwise provided herein, until the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser and Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to hold and cause each of its affiliates, representatives, agents,
consultants and advisors to hold all information and documents obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby confidential, as well as
all oral and written information concerning the Seller or the Property (the "DUE
DILIGENCE MATERIAL") whether received from the Seller, generated by Purchaser in
the course of Purchaser's inspections or from any third party. The Due Diligence
Material shall not be disclosed, discussed or made known without the prior
written consent of the Seller, except to the Purchaser, any assignee or
prospective assignee, or any hotel franchisers, any marketing company employed
to do feasibility studies, any banking, accounting, legal or other advisors
needed to consult with Purchaser or any assignee or prospective assignee in
connection with the proposed transaction or as necessary to enforce the terms of
this Agreement. If the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated for
any reason whatsoever, the Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable, return to
Seller such information and documents (and any copies thereof which have not
been destroyed by Purchaser) that were provided to Purchaser by Seller.

         16.2 NO RECORDATION; NO GOVERNMENTAL CONTACT. In furtherance of the
above confidentiality provisions, Seller and Purchaser agree (a) that neither
this Agreement nor any memorandum or notice hereof will be recorded and (b) that
neither Purchaser nor any of its representatives or agents shall contact any
Governmental Authority, or any official, agent or representative thereof,
without Purchaser giving Seller not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior
notice of such intended contact and Seller will be entitled to have a
representative present at each such meeting or contact. In all events, Purchaser
agrees to indemnify, defend and save Seller harmless against all costs, expenses
and damages, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, incurred by Seller by reason of Purchaser's failure of
performance or compliance with Purchaser's preceding obligations.

         16.3 EXCLUSIVITY. Seller hereby agrees that up until November 15, 2001,
Seller will not solicit or entertain negotiations with any other party to sell
the Property, or accept any offer to sell the Property or any portion thereof,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser. ACCEPTANCE. This Agreement shall
be regarded as an offer by Purchaser to Seller, and is open for acceptance by
Seller until 5:00 p.m. P.S.T. on November 2, 2001. Acceptance shall occur upon
the return to Purchaser of a dated and fully executed original counterpart
hereof and upon acceptance by Encinitas Resort Corporation of the Encinitas
Contract.

                  10.6.1 Subject to Sections 10.6.3, 10.6.4 and 10.6.5 below,
         subsequent to the Closing, Adelson, Molasky and Roen, and the then
         current spouse of each of them and the children of each of them (the
         "Children") shall for the life of each be provided with the following
         uses, food, beverages, goods and services of the La Costa Hotel & Spa
         without charge:

                           (a) personal use of the spa, tennis, golf, country
                  club and other non-hotel facilities and services, including
                  normal VIP transportation;

                           (b) personal use of hotel rooms on an as-available
                  basis, including, on an as-available basis, use of a
                  Presidential Suite and next-best accommodations;

                           (c) a generous allowance for food and beverage
                  services, which allowance shall be determined from time to
                  time in the reasonable discretion of Mr. Howard James or Mr.
                  Donald Stephenson during such period as either of them remains
                  an officer of Management Company; and

                           (d) a continuation of the existing thirty percent
                  (30%) discount received by such individuals at certain shops
                  located on La Costa Hotel & Spa, to the extent that such shops
                  are and continue to be owned and operated by Buyer after the
                  Closing, and a discount at shops opened or leased to third
                  parties hereafter (including the leasing of shops currently
                  owned by Partnership) at La Costa Hotel & Spa equal to the
                  best discount that is made available to the President or any
                  other executives of Buyer.

                  10.6.2 Subject to Sections 10.6.3 and 10.6.4 below, subsequent
         to the Closing and until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, and
         thereafter if and to the extent extended from time to time in the sole
         discretion of Buyer, Adelson, Molasky and Roen each shall have the
         right to request that the uses, food, beverages and services described
         in Sections 10.6.1(a), (b) and (c) above be provided without charge to
         persons they designate, and upon such request, Buyer shall provide such
         uses, food, beverages and services if, with prior notice, Management
         Company determines in its reasonable discretion that doing so is in the
         best interest of promoting the La Costa Hotel & Spa and is permitted by
         law.

                  10.6.3 All parties entitled to the uses of La Costa Hotel &
         Spa permitted by this Section shall make such use consistent with
         normal, reasonable and customary guest use in full compliance with all
         generally-applicable rules, regulations and standards of conduct
         established by the Management Company. The foregoing requirement shall
         not limit the rights expressly granted in Section 10.6.1. Use of hotel
         rooms as herein provided does not contemplate residence by any person
         for extended periods, and the duration of any stay shall be consistent
         in duration with pre-Closing use by such person but shall not be more
         than thirty (30) consecutive days. For

<Page>


         purposes of this Section 10.6, "as-available" means available as of the
         time that a reservation is made, but no such reservation shall be made
         more than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the requested
         stay.

                  10.6.4 All complimentary uses, food, beverages, goods and
         services to which any individual shall be entitled under this Section
         10.6 shall be extended based upon charge slips signed by the
         individuals entitled thereto.

                  10.6.5 In the event that a person entitled to complimentary
         uses, food, beverages, goods and services under Section 10.6.1 above is
         accompanied by other persons not so entitled, the uses, food,
         beverages, goods and services furnished to such other persons shall be
         billed and collected at the full normal charge therefor.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the then current spouses of the Children
         shall be entitled to complimentary uses, food, beverages, goods and
         services under Section 10.6.1 above during the life of their spouse,
         and the children of the Children shall be entitled to the complimentary
         uses, food, beverages, goods and services under Section 10.6.1 above
         only when accompanying their parents.

                  10.6.6 Molasky, Adelson and Roen shall, at their own expense,
         be entitled to remain on the health insurance policy provided by Buyer
         to employees of La Costa Hotel & Spa, for so long as permitted under
         the applicable insurance policy. When a policy from an acceptable
         insurer which will permit Molasky, Adelson and Roen at their own
         expense to be on the policy is generally available on the same price
         and other terms and conditions as other policies which will not so
         permit, Buyer agrees to procure such a policy so long as it is not
         unreasonable, under all the facts and circumstances, to require it to
         do so.

                  10.6.7 The benefits provided by this Section 10.6 are not an
         encumbrance upon or other interest in, charge upon or reservation from
         any of the Partnership Property. Buyer agrees to cause any buyer to
         whom it sells the Business to agree to assume Buyer's obligations
         hereunder.
