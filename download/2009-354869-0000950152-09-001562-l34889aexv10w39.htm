<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, FIRSTMERIT CORPORATION, a corporation, organized under
the laws of Ohio (the &#147;<U>Borrower</U>&#148;), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to the order of SunTrust Bank
(the &#147;<U>Lender</U>&#148;) for the account of its Applicable Lending Office (as defined in the Credit
Agreement referred to below) on the Commitment Termination Date (as so defined) the principal sum
of FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ($15,000,000) or, if less, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the Advances (as defined below) pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from the
date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates, and
payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.
 In addition, should legal action or an attorney at-law be utilized to collect any amount due
hereunder, the Borrower further promises to pay all costs of collection, including the reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees of the Lender.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both principal and interest are payable in lawful money of the United States of America in
immediately available funds at the office of the Lender at 303 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia
30308. Each Advance made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all
payments made on account of principal thereof, shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any
transfer hereof, endorsed on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Note; <U>provided</U>,
that the failure of the Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Note is the Note referred to in, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement
dated as of July&nbsp;20, 2007 (the &#147;<U>Credit Agreement</U>&#148;, the terms defined therein being used
herein as therein defined) between the Borrower and the Lender. The Credit Agreement contains
provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated events and
also for prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and
conditions therein specified.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind. Time is of
the essence. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights hereunder on the part
of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.
