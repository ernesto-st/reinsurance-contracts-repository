claim and interpose at their own expense in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated
any defense or defenses which they may deem available to the insolvent party or its liquidator,
receiver, or statutory successor; that the expenses thus incurred by the reinsurer shall be
chargeable subject to court approval against the insolvent party as part of the expense of
liquidation to the extent of the proportionate benefit which may accrue to the insolvent party

opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Agreement, it is hereby mutually agreed that such
dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration before a panel of three
arbitrators, all of whom shall be active or retired disinterested officers of property and casualty
insurance companies, reinsurance companies or underwriters at Lloyd&#146;s, London. One arbitrator
shall be chosen by each party to the dispute, and the third, an umpire, to be chosen by the other
two arbitrators before they enter upon arbitration. In the event of any party refusing or
neglecting to appoint an arbitrator within 90&nbsp;days after the other party requests it to do so, or
if the arbitrators fail to appoint an umpire within 60&nbsp;days after they have accepted their
appointments, such arbitrator or umpire, as the case may be, shall, upon the application of any
party, be appointed by The American Arbitration Association and the arbitrators and the umpire
shall thereupon proceed. The arbitrators shall consider this Agreement as an honorable engagement
rather than merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial formalities and may
abstain from following the strict rules of law. The decision of the majority of the arbitrators
shall be final and binding on all parties. Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator
and shall jointly and equally bear the other expenses of the umpire and of the arbitration. Any
such arbitration shall take place in Erie, Pennsylvania, or such other place as may be mutually
agreed.
