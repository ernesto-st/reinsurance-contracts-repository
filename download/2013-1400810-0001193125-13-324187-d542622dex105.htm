demand, or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment to the Company of the aggregate amount of any such taxes and other amounts. If Shares are deliverable upon exercise or payment of an Award, the Committee may permit
a Participant to satisfy all or a portion of the Federal, state and local withholding tax obligations arising in connection with such Award by electing to (a)&nbsp;have the Company withhold Shares otherwise issuable under the Award, (b)&nbsp;tender

requires. In any case, the Company may defer making payment or delivery under any Award if any such tax may be pending unless and until the Participant has fulfilled all obligations with respect to such tax in a manner which is satisfactory to the
