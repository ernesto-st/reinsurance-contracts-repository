simultaneously with each change in the Prime Rate.  Each LIBOR Advance shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including
the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including)
the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined by the
Agent as applicable to such LIBOR Advance based upon Borrower's selections
under Section 2.9 and 2.10 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof.
      -----------     ----
No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date.

     2.12. Rates Applicable After Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the
	   ------------------------------
contrary contained in Section 2.9 or 2.10, during the continuance of a
		      -----------    ----
Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to Borrower
(which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders
notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of
				 -----------
the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no Advance may be
made as, converted into or continued as a LIBOR Advance.  During the
continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice
to Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required
Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous
					 -----------
consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that each Loan
shall bear interest at a higher rate which is two percentage points (2.00%)
per annum above the Interest Rate then in effect hereunder; provided, that
							    --------
during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the higher rate
					  -----------    ---
set forth above shall be applicable to all Loans without any election or
action on the part of the Agent or any Lender.

<PAGE>

     2.13. Method of Payment.  All payments of the Obligations hereunder
	   -----------------
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to
Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in
------------
writing by the Agent to Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due
and shall be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment
delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered
promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent
received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending
					      ------------
Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender.
The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of Borrower maintained
with Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees payable thereby
as it becomes due hereunder.

     2.14. Evidence of Indebtedness.
	   ------------------------

	   (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the Obligations of Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time
to time hereunder.

	   (b) The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record
(i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest
Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due
and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder
from Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

	   (c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence
and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, that the failure
						 --------
of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of Borrower to repay the
Obligations in accordance with their terms.

	   (d) In addition to the foregoing, each Lender's Commitment for
Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by a promissory note (a "Revolving Note")
							    --------------
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto.
			     ---------

     2.15. Telephonic Notices.  Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and
	   ------------------
the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types
of Advances and to transfer funds based in each case on telephonic notices
made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes
to be a person identified on the List of Authorized Persons set forth on
Schedule 2.15 hereto, as the same may be amended in writing from time to time,
-------------
who is acting on behalf of Borrower.  Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the
Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized
Officer.  If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from
the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and
the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.

				    19
<PAGE>

     2.16. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest accrued
	   ----------------------------------------------
on each Prime Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof and at
maturity.  Interest accrued on each LIBOR Loan shall be payable on the last
day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the LIBOR Loan is
prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest
accrued on each LIBOR Loan having an Interest Period longer than three months
shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during
such Interest Period.  Interest and non-use fees shall be calculated for
actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.  Interest shall be
payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on
the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place
of payment.  If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall
become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment,
such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection
with such payment.

     2.17. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and
	   Commitment Reductions.
	   ---------------------------------------------------------
Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of the
contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice,
Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.
The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each
LIBOR Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give
each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Prime Rate.

     2.18. Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans at any
	   ---------------------
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to
any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder
shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of such Lending
Installation.  Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and Borrower
in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending
		   ------------
Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account
Loan payments are to be made.

     2.19. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent.  Unless Borrower or a Lender,
	   ---------------------------------
as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does
not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has
been made.  The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of
such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption.  If such Lender or Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact
made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on
demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together
with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on
the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the
Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of
payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (y) in
the case of payment by Borrower, the Interest Rate applicable to the relevant
Loan.

				ARTICLE III
			  YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES
			  -----------------------

     3.1. Yield Protection.  If, on or after the Initial Closing Date, any
	  ----------------
Lender determines that the adoption of or change in any law or any
governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or
directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

	  (a) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to
	      any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other
	      than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect
	      of its LIBOR Loans, or

	  (b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
	      assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar
	      requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
	      of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending
	      Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into
	      account in determining the interest rate applicable to LIBOR
	      Advances), or

	  (c) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
	      the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of
	      agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining its LIBOR
	      Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any
	      applicable Lending Installation in connection with its LIBOR
	      Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending
	      Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the
	      amount of LIBOR Loans held or interest received by it, by an
	      amount deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
or applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining its LIBOR
Loans or Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation in connection with such LIBOR Loans or
Commitment, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, Borrower shall pay
such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such Lender fails to notify Borrower within 180 days of such
change, then such Lender shall only be entitled to payment for additional
amounts incurred from and after the date which is 180 days prior to the date
that such Lender gives such notice.

     3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations.  If a Lender determines
	  ---------------------------------------
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender,
any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand
by such Lender, Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary

				    21
<PAGE>

to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this
Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking
into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy); provided, that
							     --------
if any Lender fails to notify Borrower within 180 days after it obtains
actual knowledge of any event giving rise to the payment of additional
amounts under this Section 3.2, then such Lender shall only be entitled to
		   -----------
payment for additional amounts incurred from and after the date which is 180
days prior to the date that such Lender gives such notice.  "Change" means
							     ------
(a) any change after the Initial Closing Date in or change in the
interpretation of the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (b) any adoption of
or change in or change in the interpretation of any other law, governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this
Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation
controlling any Lender.  "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (x) the
			  -----------------------------
risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of
this Agreement, including transition rules, and (y) the corresponding capital
regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States
implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation
and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital
Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any
amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

     3.3. Availability of Types of Advances.  If any Lender determines that
	  ---------------------------------
maintenance of its LIBOR Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (a)
deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund LIBOR Advances are
not available or (b) the interest rate applicable to a Type of Advance does
not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining such Advance, then
the Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of Advance and
require any affected LIBOR Advances to be repaid or converted to Prime Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts
required by Section 3.4.
	    -----------

     3.4. Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a LIBOR Advance occurs
	  -----------------------
on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether
because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a LIBOR Advance is not
made on the date specified by Borrower for any reason other than default by
the Lenders, Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred
by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in
liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such LIBOR
Advance.

     3.5. Taxes.
	  -----
	  (a) Subject to Section 3.5(d), all payments by Borrower to or for
			 --------------
the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes.  If
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.5) such Lender or the
-----------
				    22

<PAGE>

Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower shall make such
deductions, (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) Borrower shall furnish
to the Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof within
30 days after such payment is made.  Any amounts paid by Borrower hereunder
which are subsequently determined to be overpayments shall be refunded to
Borrower within 30 days of such determination.

	  (b) In addition, Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes,
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made pursuant to this
Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise
with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").
					      -----------

	  (c) Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation,
any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.5)
							       -----------
paid by the Agent or such Lender in respect of this Agreement or any Note and
any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority.  Payments due under this indemnification shall be
made within 30 days of the date the Agent or such Lender makes demand
therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.
		     -----------

	  (d) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees
						     ---------------
that it will, not less than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
(i) deliver to each of Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of
United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in
either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of Borrower and the Agent a United States
Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is
entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.  Each
Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of Borrower and the
Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor form)
on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and
(y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent
forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may
be reasonably requested by Borrower or the Agent.  All forms or amendments
described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of
any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without
limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly
completing and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and
such Lender advises Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving
payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income
tax.


	  (e) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
provide Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (d) above
(unless such failure is due to a

				    23
<PAGE>

change in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to
the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such
Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided,
-----------                                                     --------
that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its
failure to deliver a form required under clause (d) above, Borrower shall take
such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such
Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.

	  (f) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction
of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note
pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver
to Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed
by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding
or at a reduced rate.

     3.6. Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent reasonably
	  ----------------------------------------
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its LIBOR Loans to reduce any liability of Borrower to such Lender
under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of LIBOR
      ------------  ---     ---
Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the
	       -----------
reasonable judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each
Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to Borrower (with a
copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
						       ------- ---  ---  ---
or 3.5.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
   ---
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be
final, conclusive and binding on Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a
LIBOR Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its LIBOR Loan
through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to
the deposit used as a reference in determining the LIBOR Rate applicable to
such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided
herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be
payable on demand after receipt by Borrower of such written statement.  The
obligations of Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive
			      ------------  ---  ---     ---
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     3.7. Substitution of Lender.  Upon the receipt by Borrower from any
	  ----------------------
Lender (an "Affected Lender") of a claim for compensation under
	    ---------------
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 or a notice in accordance with Section 3.3 regarding
-----------  ---    ---                                -----------
the unavailability of a Type of Advance, Borrower may: (a) request the
Affected Lender to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
replacement bank or other entity satisfactory to Borrower to acquire and
assume all or a ratable part of all of such Affected Lender's Loans and
Commitment at the face amount thereof (a "Replacement Lender"); (b) request
					  ------------------
one or more of the other Lenders to acquire and assume all or part of such
Affected Lender's Loans and Commitment (which request each such other Lender
may decline or agree to in its sole discretion); or (c) designate a
Replacement Lender.  Any such designation of a Replacement Lender under
clause (a) or (c) shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Agent
(which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld).  Any transfer of Loans or
Commitment pursuant to this Section shall be made in accordance with
Section 12.3 and Section 3.4, if applicable.

				   ARTICLE V
			 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
			 ------------------------------

     Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that, both before and
after giving effect to the Closing Transactions:

     5.1. Existence and Standing.  Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a
	  ----------------------
corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly and properly
incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the
extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite
authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business
is conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or
authorized could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.2. Authorization and Validity.  Borrower has the power and authority
	  --------------------------
and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which it is a

identify and evaluate potential risks and liabilities accruing to Borrower
due to Environmental Laws.  On the basis of this consideration, Borrower has
concluded that Environmental Laws cannot reasonably be expected to have a

or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and
the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the
inability of Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall
not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial exercise of
any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of
the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be
valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to
Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set

forth.  All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall

the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit
to Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

     9.3. Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for convenience
	  --------
of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the
provisions of the Loan Documents.

     9.4. Entire Agreement.  The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement

and understanding among Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings among Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders

Section 10.13.
-------------

     9.5. Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.  The respective
	  -----------------------------------------------
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such).  The failure of any Lender to perform
any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any
of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be construed so as to
confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.

     9.6. Expenses; Indemnification.  (a)  Borrower shall reimburse the Agent
	  -------------------------
for all reasonable costs associated with the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including, but not limited to, all of Agent's
out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not to exceed $3,500, and all reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses of attorneys engaged by the Agent. Borrower also
agrees to reimburse the Agent and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges
and out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of
attorneys for the Agent and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of
the Agent or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Agent or any Lender in
connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents.
Expenses being reimbursed by Borrower under this Section include, without
limitation, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Reports
described in the following sentence.  Borrower acknowledges that from time to
time Agent may prepare and may distribute to the Lenders (but shall have no
obligation or duty to prepare or to distribute to the Lenders) certain audit
reports (the "Reports") pertaining to Borrower's assets for internal use by
	      -------
Agent from information furnished to it by or on behalf of Borrower, after
Agent has exercised its rights of inspection pursuant to this Agreement.

	(b)  Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify the Agent and each
Lender and the directors, officers and employees of each against all losses,
claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including,
without limitation, all expenses of litigation or

				    47

<PAGE>

preparation therefor whether or not the Agent or any Lender is a party
thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated
hereby, the other Closing Transactions or the direct or indirect application
or proposed application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder except to the
extent that (i) they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification or (ii) that they
arise solely from any dispute of or any litigation or other proceeding
instituted by any Lender against the Agent (if the Agent was determined to
have breached its obligations to such Lender hereunder) or (for Persons other
than the Agent and its directors, officers and employees) any other Lender.
The obligations of Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive the
				       -----------
termination of this Agreement.

     9.7. Number of Documents.  All statements, notices, closing documents,
	  -------------------
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient
counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.

     9.8. Accounting.  Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
	  ----------
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with GAAP or SAP, as the
case may be.

     9.9. Severability of Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan Document that
	  --------------------------
is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are
declared to be severable.

     9.10. Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between Borrower on the
	   -----------------------
one hand and the Lenders and the Agent on the other hand shall be solely that
of borrower and lender.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any
fiduciary responsibilities to Borrower.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender
undertakes any responsibility to Borrower to review or inform Borrower of any
matter in connection with any phase of Borrower's business or operations.
Borrower agrees that neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have liability to
Borrower (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses
suffered by Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by
the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from (a) the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought
or (b) the failure of the party from which recovery is sought to honor its
Commitment hereunder.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any
liability with respect to, and Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees
not to sue for, any special, indirect or consequential damages suffered by
Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the
Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

     9.11. Confidentiality.  Each of the Agent and each Lender agrees to hold
	   ---------------
any confidential information which it may receive from Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure (a) to its Affiliates and
to other Lenders and their respective

				    48

<PAGE>

Affiliates, (b) to legal counsel, accountants, and other professional
advisors to that Lender or to a Transferee, (c) to regulatory officials, (d)
to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required by law, regulation, or
legal process, provided that if not prohibited by law, the Agent or such
Lender will use reasonable efforts to provide notice to Borrower of the
requested disclosure and give Borrower a reasonable opportunity to seek a
protective order with respect to such information prior to delivering
confidential information in response thereto, (e) to any Person in connection
with any legal proceeding to which that Lender is a party, to the extent
reasonably necessary, and (f) permitted by Section 12.4.
					   ------------

     9.12. Nonreliance.  Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying
	   -----------
on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the Loans
provided for herein.

     9.13. Disclosure.  Borrower and each Lender hereby (a) acknowledge and
	   ----------
agree that Agent and/or its Affiliates from time to time may make other loans
to or have other relationships with Borrower, and (b) waive any liability of
Agent or such Affiliate to Borrower or any Lender, respectively, arising out
of or resulting from such loans or relationships other than liabilities
arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or its
Affiliates.

				  ARTICLE X
				  THE AGENT
				  ---------

     10.1. Appointment; Nature of Relationship.  LaSalle is hereby appointed
	   -----------------------------------
by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to
as the "Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the
	-----
Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents.  The Agent agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this
Article X.  Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is
---------
expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (a) does not hereby assume any
fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (b) is a "representative" of the
Lenders within the meaning of Section 9-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code
and (c) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of
which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.  Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against
the Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of
fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.  The
Documentation Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

     10.2. Powers.  The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under
	   ------
the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of
each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to
the Lenders to take any action thereunder, except any action specifically
provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

				    49

<PAGE>

     10.3. General Immunity.  Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
	   ----------------
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to Borrower, the Lenders or any
Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except
to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

     10.4. No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc.  Neither the Agent nor
	   ------------------------------------------
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement,
warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any
borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information
directly to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in
Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the
----------
Agent; (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured
Default; (e) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished
in connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or
priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the financial
condition of Borrower or of any of Borrower's Subsidiaries.  The Agent shall
have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to
be furnished by Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily
furnished by Borrower to the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its
individual capacity as a Lender).

     10.5. Action on Instructions of Lenders.  The Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed
by the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.  The
Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any
discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in
writing to do so by the Required Lenders.  The Agent shall be fully justified
in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan
Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may
incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

     10.6. Employment of Agents and Counsel.  The Agent may execute any of its
	   --------------------------------
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.  The Agent shall be entitled to advice
of counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the
Lenders and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under
any other Loan Document.

     10.7. Reliance on Documents; Counsel.  The Agent shall be entitled to

				    50

<PAGE>

persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel
selected by the Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Agent.

     10.8. Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to
	   -----------------------------------------
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to
their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts
not reimbursed by Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement
by Borrower under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two
or more of the Lenders) and (c) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection
therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without
limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent
in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between
two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the
Loan Documents or of any such other documents; provided, that no Lender
					       --------
shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the
foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Agent.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall
							 ------------
survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     10.9. Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
	   -----------------
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default".  In the event
that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lenders.

     10.10. Rights as a Lender.  In the event the Agent is a Lender, the
	    ------------------
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other
Loan Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender"
or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the
context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity.
The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with Borrower or any Subsidiary in which Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.  The Agent, in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

     10.11. Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
	    ----------------------
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and
based on the financial statements prepared by Borrower and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance

				    51

<PAGEa>

upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     10.12. Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving
	    ---------------
written notice thereof to the Lenders and Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
its intention to resign.  The Agent may be removed at any time with or
without cause by written notice received by the Agent from the Required
Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required
Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint, with the consent of Borrower (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), on behalf of Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Agent giving notice
of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of
Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent.  Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, the Agent may at any time without the consent of Borrower or any
Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a
successor Agent hereunder.  If the Agent has resigned or been removed and no
successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of
the Agent hereunder and Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the
Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal
directly with the Lenders.  No successor Agent shall be deemed to be
appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment.
Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and
retained earnings of at least $500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent.  Upon the
effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder
and under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the resignation or
removal of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in
					    ---------
effect for the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents.  In the event that there is a successor to
the Agent by merger, or the Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an
Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used
			   -------------
in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate
of the new Agent.

     10.13.  Agent's Fee.  Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for its own
	     -----------
account, the fees agreed to by Borrower and the Agent pursuant to that
certain fee letter agreement dated as of even date herewith, or as otherwise
agreed from time to time.

     10.14. Delegation to Affiliates.  Borrower and the Lenders agree that
	    ------------------------
the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates.  Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers,
agents and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement
shall be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and
other protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX
								 -----------
and X.

				 ARTICLE XI
			 SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS
			 ------------------------

     11.1. Setoff.  In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
	   ------
the Lenders under applicable law, if Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender
or any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such
Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be
due.  Notwithstanding the above, this right of setoff shall not apply to any
deposits held by Borrower or a Subsidiary in a fiduciary or custodial
capacity.

     11.2. Ratable Payments.  If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
	   ----------------
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant
to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received
   -----------  ---  ---    ---
by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a
portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase
each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans or, in the alternative,
to submit such overpayment received by such Lender to Agent for application
by Agent to the other Lenders such that each Lender will hold its ratable
proportion of Loans.  If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or
amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or
other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to
setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral
ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In case any such payment is disturbed
by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made.
If an amount to be setoff is to be applied to the Obligations of Borrower to
a Lender other than Indebtedness comprised of Loans made by such Lender, such
amount shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the
Indebtedness comprised of the Loans.

Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (a) Borrower
shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan
Documents and (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3.  Notwithstanding clause (b) of this Section, any Lender
     ------------
may at any time, without the consent of Borrower or the Agent, assign all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal
Reserve Bank; provided, that no such assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank
	      --------
shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.  The Agent
may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with
Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other
------------
transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Agent.  Any
assignee or transferee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by
acceptance of such transfer or assignment to be bound by all the terms and
provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or consent of any
Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent is the owner of the rights to any

				    53

<PAGE>

Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of
the rights to such Loan.

     12.2. Participations.
	   --------------
	   12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Lender may, in
		  ------------------------------
the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at
any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
						       ------------
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by
such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest, right and/or
obligation of such Lender under the Loan Documents.  In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the
holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the
Loan Documents, all amounts payable by Borrower under this Agreement shall be
determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and
Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents.


	   12.2.2 Voting Rights.  Each Lender shall retain the sole
		  -------------
right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any
amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in
which such Participant has an interest which forgives principal, interest or
fees or reduces the Interest Rate or fees payable with respect to any such
Loan or Commitment, extends the Facility Termination Date, postpones any date
fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees
on, any such Loan or Commitment, or releases all or substantially all of the
collateral, if any, securing any such Loan.

	   12.2.3 Benefit of Setoff.  Borrower agrees that each
		  -----------------
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in
Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under
------------
the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating
interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents,
provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in
Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to
------------
each Participant.  The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each
Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1,
							   ------------
agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise
of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with
Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.
------------

     12.3. Assignments.
	   -----------

	   12.3.1 Permitted Assignments.  Any Lender may, in the
		  ---------------------
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any
						     ----------
part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.  Such assignment
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B or in such other form as may
				      ---------
be agreed to by the parties thereto.  The consent of Borrower, the Lender and
the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with
respect to a Purchaser which is not a

				    54

<PAGE>

Lender or an Affiliate thereof; provided, that if a Default has occurred and
				--------
is continuing, the consent of Borrower shall not be required.  Such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Each such assignment shall
(unless (x) each of Borrower and the Agent otherwise consents or (y) the
proposed Purchaser is already a Lender) be in an amount not less than the
lesser of (a) $5,000,000 or (b) the remaining amount of the assigning
Lender's Commitment (calculated as at the date of such assignment).

	   12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date.  Upon (a) delivery to the
		  ----------------------
Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit I to Exhibit B (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents
	     ---------     --------------------
required by Section 12.3.1, and (b) payment of a $3,500 fee (payable by the
	    --------------
assigning Lender or its assignee) to the Agent for processing such assignment,
such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such
Notice of Assignment.  The Notice of Assignment shall contain a representation
by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the
purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement
are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of
the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under
ERISA.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser
shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan
Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights
and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if
it were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action by
Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be required to release the transferor
Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans
assigned to such Purchaser.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to a

				  FORM OF
			   ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT


	This Assignment Agreement (this "Assignment Agreement") between
	       (the "Assignor") and                                 (the
--------------                      -------------------------------
"Assignee") is dated as of                     .  The parties hereto agree as
			   --------------------
follows:

     1. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.  The Assignor is a party to the Credit
	---------------------
Agreement (which, as it may be amended, supplemented, modified, renewed or
extended from time to time is herein called the "Credit Agreement") described
in Item 1 of Schedule 1 attached hereto.  Capitalized terms used but not
	     ----------
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the
Credit Agreement.

     2. ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION.  The Assignor hereby sells and
	-------------------------
assigns to the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from
the Assignor, an interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations
under the Credit Agreement such that after giving effect to such assignment
the Assignee shall have purchased pursuant to this Assignment Agreement the
percentage interest specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1 of all outstanding
					   ----------
rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement relating to the Loans and
the other Loan Documents.  The aggregate Commitment (or Loans, if the
applicable Commitment has been terminated) purchased by the Assignee hereunder
is set forth in Item 4 of Schedule 1.
			  ----------

     3. EFFECTIVE DATE.  The effective date of this Assignment
	--------------
Agreement (the "Effective Date") shall be the later of the date specified in
Item 5 of Schedule 1 or two Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by
	  ----------
the Agent) after a Notice of Assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit I
								     ---------
attached hereto has been delivered to the Agent.  Such Notice of Assignment
must include any consents required to be delivered to the Agent pursuant to
Section 12.3.1 of the Credit Agreement.  In no event will the Effective Date
occur if the payments required to be made by the Assignee to the Assignor on
the Effective Date under Section 4 hereof are not made on the proposed
			 ---------
Effective Date.  The Assignor will notify the Assignee of the proposed
Effective Date no later than the Business Day prior to the proposed Effective
Date.  As of the Effective Date, (a) the Assignee shall have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to the rights
and obligations assigned to the Assignee hereunder, and (b) the Assignor shall
relinquish its rights and be released from its corresponding obligations under
the Loan Documents with respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the
Assignee hereunder.

     4. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.  On and after the Effective Date, the
	-------------------
Assignee shall be entitled to receive from the Agent all payments of
principal, interest and fees with respect to the interest assigned hereby.
The Assignee shall advance funds directly to the Agent

				   B-1

<PAGE>

with respect to all Loans and reimbursement payments made on or after the
Effective Date with respect to the interest assigned hereby.  [In
consideration for the sale and assignment of Loans hereunder, (a) the
Assignee shall pay the Assignor, on the Effective Date, an amount equal to
the principal amount of the portion of all Prime Rate Advances assigned to
the Assignee hereunder, and (b) with respect to each LIBOR Advance made by
the Assignor and assigned to the Assignee hereunder which is outstanding on
the Effective Date, (i) on the last day of the Interest Period therefor,
(ii) on such earlier date agreed to by the Assignor and the Assignee, or
(iii) on the date on which any such LIBOR Advance either becomes due (by
acceleration or otherwise) or is prepaid (the date as described in the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) being hereinafter referred to as the
"Payment Date"), the Assignee shall pay the Assignor an amount equal to the
principal amount of the portion of such LIBOR Advance assigned to the
Assignee which is outstanding on the Payment Date.  If the Assignor and the
Assignee agree that the Payment Date for such LIBOR Advance shall be the
Effective Date, they shall agree to the interest rate applicable to the
portion of such Loan assigned hereunder for the period from the Effective
Date to the end of the existing Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR
Advance (the "Agreed Interest Rate") and any interest received by the
Assignee in excess of the Agreed Interest Rate shall be remitted to the
Assignor.  In the event interest for the period from the Effective Date to but
not including the Payment Date is not paid by Borrower with respect to any
LIBOR Advance sold by the Assignor to the Assignee hereunder, the Assignee
shall pay to the Assignor interest for such period on the portion of such
LIBOR Advance sold by the Assignor to the Assignee hereunder at the applicable
rate provided by the Credit Agreement.  In the event a prepayment of any LIBOR
Advance which is existing on the Payment Date and assigned by the Assignor to
the Assignee hereunder occurs after the Payment Date but before the end of the
Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Advance, the Assignee shall remit to
the Assignor the excess of the prepayment penalty paid with respect to the
portion of such LIBOR Advance assigned to the Assignee hereunder over the
amount which would have been paid if such prepayment penalty was calculated
based on the Agreed Interest Rate.  The Assignee will also promptly remit to
the Assignor (x) any principal payments received from the Agent with respect
to LIBOR Advances prior to the Payment Date, and (y) any amounts of interest
on Loans and fees received from the Agent which relate to the portion of the
Loans assigned to the Assignee hereunder for periods prior to the Effective
Date, in the case of Prime Rate Loans, or the Payment Date, in the case of
LIBOR Loans, and not previously paid by the Assignee to the Assignor.]* In the
event that either party hereto receives any payment to which the other party
hereto is entitled under this Assignment Agreement, then the party receiving
such amount shall promptly remit it to the other party hereto.

     *  Each Assignor may insert its standard payment provisions in lieu of
the payment terms included in this Exhibit.

     5. FEES PAYABLE BY THE ASSIGNEE.  The Assignee shall pay to the
	----------------------------
Assignor a fee on each day on which a payment of interest or non-use fees is
made under the Credit Agreement with respect to the amounts assigned to the

				    B-2

<PAGE>

Assignee hereunder (other than a payment of interest or non-use fees for the
period prior to the Effective Date or, in the case of LIBOR Loans, the Payment
Date, which the Assignee is obligated to deliver to the Assignor pursuant to
Section 4 hereof).  The amount of such fee shall be the difference between
---------
(a) the interest or fee, as applicable, paid with respect to the amounts
assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (b) the interest or fee, as applicable,
which would have been paid with respect to the amounts assigned to the
Assignee hereunder if each interest rate was    of 1% less than the interest
rate paid by Borrower or if the non-use fee was      of 1% less than the non-
						 ---
use fee paid by Borrower, as applicable.  In addition, the Assignee agrees to
pay    % of the recordation fee required to be paid to the Agent in
    ---
connection with this Assignment Agreement.

     6. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ASSIGNOR; LIMITATIONS ON THE ASSIGNOR'S
LIABILITY.

purporting to secure the Loans, or (g) any mistake, error of judgment, or
action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with the Loans or the Loan
Documents.

under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms thereof,

which by the terms of the Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as

entitled to receive payments under the Loan Documents without deduction or

without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) and liabilities incurred by
the Assignor in connection with or arising in any manner from the Assignee's
non-performance of the obligations assumed under this Assignment Agreement.
The obligations of the Assignee under this Section 8 shall survive the payment
					   ---------
of all amounts hereunder and the termination of this Agreement.

     9. SUBSEQUENT ASSIGNMENTS.  After the Effective Date, the
	----------------------
Assignee shall have the right pursuant to and in accordance with Section 12.3
of the Credit Agreement to assign the rights which are assigned to the
Assignee hereunder to any entity or person; provided, that (a) any such
					    --------
subsequent assignment does not violate any of the terms and conditions of the
Loan Documents or any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction
or decree and that any consent required under the terms of the Loan Documents
has been obtained, and (b) unless the prior written consent of the Assignor is
obtained, the Assignee is not thereby released from its obligations to the
Assignor hereunder, if any remain unsatisfied, including, without limitation,

     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Ohio Casualty Corporation ("Borrower") HEREBY
PROMISES TO PAY to the order of

(the "Lender") the principal sum of                             United States
				     -------------------------
Dollars ($          ) or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
	  ----------
the Revolving Loans made by the Lender to Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1 of
							       -----------
the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined), on or before the Facility
Termination Date; together, in each case, with interest on any and all
principal amounts remaining unpaid hereunder from time to time.  Interest upon
the unpaid principal amount hereof shall accrue at the rates, shall be

accrued interest shall be payable upon demand.  Both principal and interest
shall be payable in accordance with the Credit Agreement to LaSalle Bank
National Association, as Agent (the "Agent") on behalf of the Lender in
immediately available funds.  The Revolving Loans made by the Lender to
Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement and all payments on account of
principal hereof shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer
thereof, endorsed on Schedule A attached hereto which is part of this
		     ----------
Revolving Note or otherwise in accordance with its usual practices; provided,
								    --------
however, that the failure to so record shall not affect Borrower's obligations

     This Revolving Note is a Revolving Note referred to in, and is
entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement dated as of July 31, 2002 by
and among Borrower, the financial institutions signatory thereto (including

kind in connection with this Revolving Note.

				   EXHIBIT D

			      SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE


     The undersigned,                        , hereby certifies that the
		      -----------------------
undersigned (a) is the                              of Ohio Casualty
		       ----------------------------
Corporation (the "Borrower"), (b)  is familiar with the properties, business
		  --------
and assets of the Borrower and (c) is authorized to execute and deliver this
Certificate on behalf of the Borrower.  The undersigned further certifies that
the undersigned has carefully reviewed the contents of this Certificate and,
in connection herewith, has made such investigations and inquiries as the
undersigned deemed necessary and prudent.  The undersigned further certifies
that the undersigned believes that the financial information and assumptions
which underlie and form the basis for the representations made in this
Certificate were reasonable when made and continue to be reasonable as of the
date hereof.  Capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Credit
Agreement dated as of July 31, 2002 (as amended or otherwise modified from
time to time, the "Credit Agreement") among the Borrower, the Lenders named
		   ----------------
therein (the "Lenders"), LaSalle Bank National Association, as agent for the
	      -------
Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent") and ING Capital LLC, as Documentation
				-----
Agent, are used herein as so defined.  The undersigned hereby further
certifies that it is the belief of the undersigned that:

     1. As of the date hereof, and after giving effect to the initial
Loans under the Credit Agreement, the value (in accordance with GAAP or SAP)
of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis
will exceed the debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

     2. As of the date hereof, and after giving effect to the initial
Loans under the Credit Agreement, the present value (in accordance with GAAP
or SAP) of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis on their debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured.

     3. As of the date hereof, and after giving effect to the initial
Loans under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become
absolute and matured.

     4. As of the date hereof, and after giving effect to the initial
Loans under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to
conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such businesses are now
conducted and are proposed to be conducted after the date hereof.

     5. The Borrower or its Subsidiaries do not intend, in
consummating the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, to delay
hinder or defraud either present or future

<PAGE>

creditors or other Persons to which the Borrower or its Subsidiaries is or
will become, on or after the date hereof, indebted.

     6. The Credit Agreement was executed and delivered by or on
behalf of the Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders in good faith and in
exchange for a reasonably equivalent value.

     7. In reaching the conclusions set forth in this Certificate, I
have considered, among other things,:

	(a) the cash and other current assets of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries;

	(b) refinancing or other replacements of existing
liabilities, debts, obligations and commitments which the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries reasonably expect will be available on the dates of
their respective maturities;

	(c) the estimated value of all property, real and
personal, tangible and intangible, of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries;

	(d) the audited financial statements of the Borrower dated
December 31, 2001 and the unaudited financial statements of the
Borrower dated March 31, 2002, all as previously delivered to the
Agent and the Lenders;

	(e) all liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
known to me on all claims, whether or not reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured, unsecured, fixed or contingent, including,
among other things, claims arising out of pending or, to my knowledge,
threatened litigation against the Borrower and its Subsidiaries;

	(f) historical growth in revenues and cash flows of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and anticipated growth in revenues and
cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and (1) certain pro
forma financial information of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and
(2) the Borrower's business plan, both as previously delivered to the
Agent and the Lenders; and

	(g) the amount of equity capital of the Borrower.

				     2
