compensate such Lender for Additional Costs resulting from any Regulatory Change which (i)&nbsp;subjects
such Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the Loan or its Note, or changes the

any event occurring after the date hereof which would entitle it to compensation pursuant to this
paragraph as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request
such compensation, and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for those portions of
the Loan affected by such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in such Lender&#146;s sole opinion, be disadvantageous to it,

Participation in the Loan from a Lender. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, in accordance with instructions signed by the Required
Lenders, and such instructions of the Required Lenders and any action taken or failure to act

not acting as Administrative Agent, and the terms &#147;Lender&#148; and &#147;Lenders&#148; shall include
Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender. Administrative Agent and its affiliates may
(without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to (on a
secured or unsecured basis), and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business
with, Borrower or Guarantor (and any affiliates of them) as if it were not acting as Administrative
Agent.

Each Lender shall pay its ratable share, based on the respective outstanding principal balances
under its Note and the other Notes, of any expenses incurred (and not paid or reimbursed by
Borrower after demand for payment is made by Administrative Agent) by or on behalf of Lenders in
connection with any Default or Event of Default, including, without limitation, costs of
enforcement of the Loan Documents and any advances to pay taxes or insurance premiums, to complete
the Improvements or otherwise to preserve the lien of the Mortgage or to preserve or protect the
Mortgaged Property. In the event a Lender fails to pay its share of expenses as aforesaid, and all
or a portion of such unpaid amount is paid by Administrative Agent and/or one or more of the other
Lenders, then the defaulting Lender shall reimburse Administrative Agent and/or the other Lender(s)
for the portion of such unpaid amount paid by it or them, as the case may be, together with
interest thereon at the Prime Based Rate from the date of payment by Administrative Agent and/or
the other Lender(s). In addition, each Lender agrees to reimburse and indemnify Administrative
Agent (to the extent it is not paid by on or behalf of Borrower, after demand for payment is made
by Administrative Agent, under Section&nbsp;8.13 or under the applicable provisions of any other Loan
Document, but without limiting the obligation of Borrower under said Section&nbsp;8.13 or such
provisions), for such Lender&#146;s ratable share, based upon the respective outstanding principal
balances under its Note and the other Notes, of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which Borrower is obligated to pay under
Section&nbsp;8.13 or under the applicable provisions of any other Loan Document) or the enforcement of
any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents or instruments; <U>provided</U>,

arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified or (ii)&nbsp;any

analysis of the collateral for the Loan and of the credit of Borrower and Guarantor, and its own
decision to enter into this Agreement, and that it will, independently and without reliance upon

required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by Borrower of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or
to inspect the properties (including, without limitation, the Properties) or books of Borrower.

to Lenders by Administrative Agent hereunder, Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of Borrower or Guarantor (or any affiliate of them) which may come
into the possession of Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates. Administrative Agent shall

required of Administrative Agent hereunder, Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall have received further assurances
(which may include cash collateral) of the indemnification obligations of Lenders under Section
7.05 in respect of any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action. If any indemnity furnished to Administrative Agent
for any purpose shall, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired,
Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, the action
indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.

Lenders shall be promptly notified thereof. Upon such resignation or removal of Administrative
Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which
successor Administrative Agent shall (provided there exists no Event of Default) be subject to
Borrower&#146;s approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted
