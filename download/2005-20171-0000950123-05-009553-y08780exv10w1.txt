circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), then such
rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 7; (ii)
if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P
for the Index Debt shall fall within different Categories, the pricing shall be
based on the higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or
more Categories lower than the other, in which case the pricing shall be

the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations,
the Borrower and the Banks shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of

amendment, the pricing shall be determined by reference to the rating most
recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

      Money Market Margin or a Money Market Absolute Rate.

The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans for more than one

as the Borrower and the Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified
to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the
first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be
effective); provided that Money Market Quotes submitted by the Agent (or any
affiliate of the Agent) in the capacity of a Bank may be submitted, and may only

of the offer or offers contained therein not later than (x) one hour prior to
the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 15
minutes prior to the deadline for the other Banks, in the case of an Absolute

shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Agent given on the
instructions of the Borrower.

            (ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the form of
      Exhibit D hereto and shall in any case specify:

            (A) the proposed date of Borrowing,

            (B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which each
      such offer is being made (expressed in Dollars), which principal amount
      (w) may be greater than or less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank,
      (x) must be $1,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, (y) may not
      exceed the principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers were
      requested and (z) may be subject to an aggregate limitation as to the
      principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers being made by such
      quoting Bank may be accepted,

            (C) the currency of the Money Market Loan for which each such offer
      is being made,

            (D) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above or below the
      applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (the "Money Market Margin")
      offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a percentage
      (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted
      from such base rate,

            (E) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest
      per annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market
      Absolute Rate") offered for each such Money Market Loan, and

            (F) the identity of the quoting Bank. A Money Market Quote may set
      forth up to five separate offers by the quoting Bank with respect to each
      Interest Period specified in the related Invitation for Money Market
      Quotes.

            (iii) Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it:

<PAGE>

                                                                              17

            (A) is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto or does
      not specify all of the information required by subsection (d)(ii);

            (B) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language;

            (C) proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in
      the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or

            (D) arrives after the time set forth in subsection (d)(i).

            (e) Notice to Borrower. The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
of the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in
accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any Money Market Quote that amends,
modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote
submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request. Any
such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent unless such
subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in
such former Money Market Quote. The Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify
(A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers have
been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Money Market
Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money Market Margins or
Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered and (C) if
applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans
for which offers in any single Money Market Quote may be accepted.

            (f) Acceptance and Notice by Borrower. Not later than 10:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction for Money Market
Loans to be made in Dollars, (y) the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of
an Absolute Rate Auction for Money Market Loans to be made in Dollars or (z) the
fifth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the
case of a LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for Money Market Loans to be
made in an Alternative Currency (or, in any case, such other time or date as the
Borrower and the Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the
Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote Request for the first
LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which such change is to be
effective), the Borrower shall notify the Agent of its acceptance or
non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to subsection (e). In
the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall
specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that
are accepted, expressed in Dollars. The Borrower may accept any Money Market
Quote in whole or in part; provided that:

            (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing
      may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in, and the currency
      thereof must be the currency set forth in, the related Money Market Quote
      Request,

            (ii) the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be
      $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000,
<PAGE>

                                                                              18

            (iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
      ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case
      may be, and

            (iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in
      subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the
      requirements of this Agreement.

            (g) Allocation by Agent. If offers are made by two or more Banks
with the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case
may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of
which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal
amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall
be allocated by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples
of $1,000,000, as the Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate
principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by the Agent of the pro rata
amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.

            (h) Money Market Loans in an Alternative Currency. The Borrower may
request Money Market Loans in an Alternative Currency subject to the terms and
conditions of this subsection (h), in addition to the other conditions
applicable to such Loans hereunder. Any request for Money Market Loans in an
Alternative Currency shall be subject to the condition that if there shall occur
at or prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of any Money Market
Borrowing to be denominated in an Alternative Currency any change in national or
international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange
rates or exchange controls which would, in the reasonable opinion of any Bank
that shall have offered to make any Money Market Loan in connection with such
Borrowing, make it impracticable for such Bank's Loan to be denominated in such
Alternative Currency, then such Bank may by notice to the Borrower and the Agent
withdraw its offer to make such Loan.

            Any Money Market Loan which is to be made in an Alternative Currency
in accordance with this subsection (h) shall be advanced in the Equivalent
Amount of the Dollar Amount thereof and shall be repaid or prepaid in such
Alternative Currency in the amount borrowed. Interest payable on any Loan
denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be paid in such Alternative
Currency.

            For purposes of determining whether the aggregate principal amount
of Loans outstanding hereunder exceeds any applicable limitation expressed in
Dollars, each Money Market Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be
deemed to be in a principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount thereof. The
Dollar Amount of any Money Market Loan with an Interest Period exceeding six
months in duration shall be adjusted on each date that would have been the last
day of an Interest Period for such Loan if such Loan had successive Interest
Periods of six months duration. Each such adjustment shall be made by the Bank
holding such Loan by determining the amount in Dollars that would be required in
order to result in an Equivalent Amount in the applicable Alternative Currency
equal to the principal amount of the applicable Loan outstanding on the date of
<PAGE>

                                                                              19

the adjustment, and the amount in Dollars so determined shall be the Dollar
Amount of such Loan unless and until another adjustment is required hereby. Each
Bank that makes a Money Market Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency
agrees to determine any such adjustments if and when required to be made
pursuant to this paragraph and to notify the Borrower and the Agent of each such
adjustment promptly upon making such determination.

            SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans. (a) During the Revolving Credit
Period each Swingline Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, to make Loans to the Borrower pursuant to this Section
from time to time in amounts such that (i) the aggregate principal amount of
Swingline Loans of such Swingline Lender at any time outstanding shall not
exceed the amount of its Swingline Commitment and (ii) the aggregate Committed
Exposure of all the Banks at any time shall not exceed the Total Commitments.
All Swingline Loans shall be made in Dollars. Each Swingline Loan shall be made
as part of a Borrowing consisting of Swingline Loans made by the Swingline
Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Swingline Commitments.

            (b) In order to request a Swingline Borrowing, the Borrower shall
notify the Agent of such request not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time)
on the day of a proposed Swingline Borrowing, specifying the proposed date
(which shall be a Domestic Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline
Borrowing (which shall be $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000) and the
duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of
the definition of Interest Period. The Agent will promptly advise the Swingline
Lenders of any such notice received from the Borrower. Each Swingline Lender
shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Agent in the same manner as for
other Domestic Loans as provided in Section 2.05 (except that each Swingline
Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Agent by 5:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the requested date of such Swingline Loan), unless such
Swingline Lender and the Borrower agree otherwise.

            (c) Each Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Banks
not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any Domestic Business Day
require the Banks to acquire participations on such Domestic Business Day in all
or a portion of the Swingline Loans of such Swingline Lender outstanding. Such
notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which the Banks
will acquire participations. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Bank hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above,
to pay to the Agent, for the account of the relevant Swingline Lender, such
Bank's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Bank
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever. Each Bank shall comply with its obligation under this
paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Bank (and Section
2.05 shall apply,
<PAGE>

                                                                              20

mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Banks). The Agent shall
notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired
pursuant to this paragraph. Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from the
Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline
Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of
participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Agent; any such amounts
received by the Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Agent to the Banks that
shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the relevant
Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations
in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of
any default in the payment thereof.

            SECTION 2.05. Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of
a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents
thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of
Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

            (b) Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of
each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in
Section 2.04 and subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of
such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York
City, to the Agent at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01 or,
subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(h), if such Borrowing is to be made in
an Alternative Currency, make available the Equivalent Amount of such
Alternative Currency on that day (in such funds as may then be customary for the
settlement of international transactions in the Alternative Currency) to the
account of the Agent at such place as shall have been notified by the Agent to
the Banks by not less than five Domestic Business Days' notice. Unless the Agent
determines that any applicable condition specified in Article III has not been
satisfied, the Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to
the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

            (c) If any Bank (including a Swingline Lender) makes a new Loan
hereunder on a day on which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an
outstanding Loan denominated in the same currency from such Bank, such Bank
shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an
amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and
the amount being repaid shall be made available by such Bank to the Agent as
provided in subsection (b), or remitted by the Borrower to the Agent as provided
in Section 2.13, as the case may be.

            (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to
the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent
such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has
made such share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.05 and the Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made
such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
<PAGE>

                                                                              21

available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at
(i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the
Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section
2.08 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank
shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

            SECTION 2.06. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such
Bank, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
Bank from time to time hereunder.

            (b) The Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i)
the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the type thereof and the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable
or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii)
the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder for the account of the
Banks and each Bank's share thereof.

            (c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Bank or the Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            (d) Any Bank may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such
Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such
Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns). Thereafter, the Loans
evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.06) be represented by one or more Notes payable
to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such Note is a registered note,
to such payee and its registered assigns).

            (e) Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Agent, request
that its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a separate Note in an amount
equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans. Each such Note
shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto with appropriate
modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans of the relevant
type. Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be
deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may
require.

            (f) Upon receipt of a Bank's Note pursuant to Section 3.01(b), the
Agent shall forward such Note to such Bank. Each Bank shall record the date,
amount, type and maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of
each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto and, in the
case of Money Market Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the currency,
amount and Dollar Amount of
<PAGE>

                                                                              22

such Loans, and prior to any transfer of its Note shall endorse on the schedule
forming a part thereof appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing
information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding; provided that the
failure of any Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect
the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes. Each Bank is
hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse its Note and to
attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and
when required.

            SECTION 2.07. Maturity of Loans. (a) All Committed Loans of each
Bank shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable by
the Borrower, together with accrued interest thereon, on the Maturity Date.

            (b) Each Money Market Loan and Swingline Loan shall mature, and the
principal amount thereof shall be due and payable by the Borrower, together with
accrued interest thereon, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to
such Loan.

            SECTION 2.08. Interest Rates. (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date
such Loan is made until it becomes due, (i) at a rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate for such day, if such day falls within any calendar quarter with
respect to which the Utilization Percentage is less than or equal to 50% or (ii)
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base Rate for such day and 0.05%, if
such day falls within a calendar quarter with respect to which the Utilization
Percentage is greater than 50%. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof, and, with respect to the principal amount of any
Base Rate Loan converted to a Euro-Dollar Loan, on each date a Base Rate Loan is
so converted; provided that the portion of interest accruing at 0.05% pursuant
to clause (ii) above shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of
each calendar quarter and upon the date of termination of the Commitments in
their entirety (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their
entirety). Any overdue principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal
to the sum of 2% plus the Base Rate.

            (b) Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin plus the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period
on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three
months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof; provided that
the portion of interest accruing at 0.05% pursuant to clause (ii) of the
definition of the term "Euro-Dollar Margin" below shall be payable quarterly in
arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter and upon the date of
termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, the date the
Loans shall be repaid in their entirety). In addition, with respect to the
principal amount of any Euro-Dollar Loan converted to a Base Rate Loan, such
interest (except interest payable pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence) shall be payable on each date a Euro-Dollar Loan is so converted.
<PAGE>

                                                                              23

            "Euro-Dollar Margin" applicable to any Euro-Dollar Loan outstanding
on any day means (i) the Applicable Rate, if such day falls within any calendar
quarter with respect to which the Utilization Percentage is less than or equal
to 50% or (ii) the sum of the Applicable Rate plus 0.05%, if such day falls
within a calendar quarter with respect to which the Utilization Percentage is
greater than 50%.

            The "London Interbank Offered Rate", applicable to any Interest
Period means the (i) the rate per annum for Dollar deposits with maturities
comparable to such Interest Period, which appears on the Telerate Page 3750 (the
"Telerate Page") at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on the day that is
two Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period and (ii) if no
such rate so appears on the Telerate Page 3750, the rate per annum determined by
the Agent to be the average (rounded upwards if necessary, to the next higher
1/32 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which Dollar deposits are
offered to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London interbank
deposit market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second full
Euro-Dollar Business Day preceding the first day of such Interest Period in an
amount equal to $5,000,000 and for a period of time equal to such Interest
Period. In the case of any Money Market LIBOR Loan denominated in an Alternative
Currency, the London Interbank Offered Rate for any Interest Period shall be
determined pursuant to clause (ii) above based upon deposits in the relevant
Alternative Currency.

            (c) Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan
shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the date
payment thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment, at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the higher of (i) the sum of the
Euro-Dollar Margin plus the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such
Loan and (ii) the Euro-Dollar Margin plus the average (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/32 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at
which one day (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar
Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer than one month as
the Agent may select) deposits in Dollars in an amount approximately equal to
such overdue payment due to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks are offered
to such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the
applicable period determined as provided above (or, if the circumstances
described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such
day).

            (d) Subject to Section 8.01(a), each Money Market LIBOR Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest
Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London
Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with
Section 2.08(c) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed
Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by the
Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Each Money Market
Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal
to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such Loan in
accordance with Section 2.03. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than
<PAGE>

                                                                              24

three months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof. Any
overdue principal of or interest on any Money Market Loan shall bear interest,
payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum
of 2% plus the Base Rate for such day.

            (e) Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at such rate per annum as shall be agreed to in writing by the Borrower
and the applicable Swingline Lender with respect to such Swingline Loan or, if
no such agreement shall be made, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for
such date. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last
day thereof. Any overdue principal of or interest on any Swingline Loan shall
bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of 2% plus the Base Rate for such day.

            (f) The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the
Loans hereunder in accordance with the provisions hereof. The Agent shall give
prompt notice to the Borrower and the participating Banks by telex, cable or
telecopy of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

            (g) Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to furnish
quotations to the Agent as contemplated by this Section. If any Reference Bank
does not furnish a timely quotation, the Agent shall determine the relevant
interest rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations furnished by the
remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on
a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

            SECTION 2.09. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for the account of the Banks ratably a facility fee, which shall accrue at
the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of each Bank (whether
used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the date on which the Commitments terminate; provided that, if any
Loans remain outstanding after the Commitments terminate, then such facility fee
shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Loans outstanding from and
including the date on which the Commitments terminate to but excluding the date
on which such Loans cease to be outstanding.

            (b) Payments. Accrued fees under subsection (a) of this Section
shall be payable quarterly on the last day of February, May, August and November
in each year (commencing August 2005) and upon the date of termination of the
Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, the date the Loans shall be repaid
in their entirety).

            SECTION 2.10. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a)
The Borrower may without penalty or premium of any kind, upon at least three
Domestic Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice to the Agent, (i)
terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are outstanding at such time
or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of $10,000,000
or any larger
<PAGE>

                                                                              25

multiple of $1,000,000, the aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans; provided that the Swingline
Commitments must be terminated if the Commitments are terminated and, if the
Commitments are reduced, the Swingline Commitments also must be reduced, if
necessary, so that after giving effect to such reduction the aggregate amount of
the Swingline Commitments shall not exceed the Total Commitments.

            (b) The Borrower may without penalty or premium of any kind, upon at
least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent, (i) terminate the
Swingline Commitments at any time, if no Swingline Loans are outstanding at such
time or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, the aggregate amount of the
Swingline Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the Swingline Loans.

            SECTION 2.11. Mandatory Termination of Commitments. The Commitments
and the Swingline Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date and any Loans
then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and
payable on such date.

            SECTION 2.12. Optional Prepayments. (a) Subject to Section 2.14 in
the case of Fixed Rate Loans but otherwise without penalty or premium of any
kind, the Borrower may, upon at least one Domestic Business Day's notice to the
Agent, prepay any Group of Loans (other than Swingline Loans, as to which
subsection (b) below shall apply), or any Money Market Borrowing bearing
interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section 8.01, in whole at any time, or
from time to time in part in amounts aggregating $10,000,000 or any larger
multiple of $1,000,000 (based on the Dollar Amount thereof, in the case of a
Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency), by paying the principal
amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment; provided that, except as expressly provided above, the Borrower may
not prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of any Money Market Loan
prior to the maturity thereof. Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to
prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in such Group or
Borrowing.

            (b) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Agent prior to 12:00 Noon
(New York City time) on the date of prepayment (which shall be a Domestic
Business Day), prepay any Swingline Borrowing in whole at any time, or from time
to time in part in amounts aggregating $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of
$1,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued
interest thereon to the date of prepayment. Each optional prepayment shall be
applied to prepay ratably the Swingline Loans of the Swingline Lenders included
in such Swingline Borrowing.

            (c) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section,
the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan,
each Swingline Lender) of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share
(if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by
the Borrower.

                                                                              26

            SECTION 2.13. General Provisions as to Payments. (a) Except as
expressly provided in subsection (b) of this Section, the Borrower shall make
each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder,
in Dollars, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due,
in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Agent
at its address referred to in Section 9.01. The Agent will promptly distribute
to each Bank (or Swingline Lender, as applicable) its ratable share of each such
payment received by the Agent for the account of the Banks (or Swingline
Lenders, as applicable).

            (b) All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder or under the
Loans in an Alternative Currency pursuant to Section 2.03(h) shall be made in
such Alternative Currency in such funds as may then be customary for the
settlement of international transactions in such Alternative Currency for the
account of the Agent, at such time and at such place as shall have been notified
by the Agent to the Borrower and the applicable Banks by not less than four
Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice. The Agent will promptly cause any such
payments for the account of any Bank to be distributed to the Bank entitled
thereto in like funds.

            (c) Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Domestic Loans, Swingline Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a
Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Domestic Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a
Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day
falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof
shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day. Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, any Money Market Loans shall be due on a day which
is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day. If the date for any
payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest
thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

            (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks or Swingline Lenders
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may
assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date
and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to
each Bank or Swingline Lender, as applicable, on such due date an amount equal
to the amount then due such Bank or Swingline Lender. If and to the extent that
the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank or Swingline Lender,
as applicable, shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Bank or Swingline Lender together with interest thereon, for
each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank or Swingline
Lender until the date such Bank or Swingline Lender repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

            SECTION 2.14. Funding Losses. If the Borrower makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan or any Fixed Rate Loan is
converted
<PAGE>

                                                                              27

(pursuant to Article II, VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or the end of an applicable
period fixed pursuant to Section 2.08(c), or if the Borrower fails to borrow any
Fixed Rate Loans (excluding a failure to borrow in a specified Alternative
Currency due to the occurrence of any change in conditions described in Section
2.03(h)) after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section
2.05(a), the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for
any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective
Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss
incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but
excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or failure to
borrow, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail as to the amount of such loss or
expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
For purposes of this Section, any Swingline Loan bearing interest at a fixed
rate shall be deemed to be a Fixed Rate Loan.

            SECTION 2.15. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on
the Prime Rate hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days
(or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and
fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the
actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day).

            SECTION 2.16. Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a) The Loans
included in each Committed Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type
of rate specified by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Committed
Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or
continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each
case to the provisions of Article VIII), as follows:

            (i) if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the Borrower may elect to
      convert such Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans as of any Euro-Dollar Business
      Day; and

            (ii) if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower may elect to
      convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans or elect to convert or continue such
      Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans for a different or additional Interest Period,
      in each case effective on any Euro-Dollar Business Day.

Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a "Notice of Interest
Rate Election") to the Agent at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days before the
conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective. A Notice
of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of
the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided that (i)
such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii)
the portion to which such Notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it
does not apply, are each $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000.

            (b) Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:
<PAGE>

                                                                              28

            (i) The Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such notice
      applies;

            (ii) the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in
      such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the applicable
      clause of subsection (a) above;

            (iii) if the Loans comprising such Group are to be converted, the
      new type of Loans and, if such new Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the
      duration of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto; and

            (iv) if such Loans are to be continued as Euro-Dollar Loans for an
      additional Interest Period, the duration of such additional Interest
      Period.

Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall
comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

            (c) Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate Election from the
Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Agent shall promptly notify each
Bank of the contents thereof and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable
by the Borrower. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Interest
Rate Election to the Agent for any Group of Fixed Rate Loans, such Loans shall
be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then current Interest
Period applicable thereto.

            SECTION 2.17. Regulation D Compensation. If and for so long as any
Bank maintains reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or any other
category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions
of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of
such Bank to United States residents), then such Bank may require the Borrower
to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on Euro-Dollar Loans,
additional interest on the related Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per
annum determined by such Bank up to but not exceeding the excess of (i)(A) the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B) one minus the
Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable London Interbank Offered
Rate. Any Bank wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall
so notify the Borrower and the Agent, in which case such additional interest on
the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank shall be payable to such Bank at the place
indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at
least four Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y)
shall notify the Borrower at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to each
date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar Loans of the amount then
due it under this Section.

            SECTION 2.18. Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining
judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower
hereunder or under any of the Loans in the currency expressed to be payable
herein or under the Loans ( the "specified currency") into another currency, the
parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures the Agent could purchase the
<PAGE>

                                                                              29

specified currency with such other currency at the Agent's New York office on
the Euro-Dollar Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.
The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Bank or the
Agent hereunder or under any Loan shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a
currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent
that on the Euro-Dollar Business Day following receipt by such Bank or the Agent
(as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency
such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal
banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency; if
the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum
originally due to such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified
currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do
so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify
such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount
of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any
Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any
amounts shared with other Banks as a result of allocations of such excess as a
disproportionate payment to such Bank under Section 9.04, such Bank or the
Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.

            SECTION 2.19. Increase in Commitments. (a) At any time after the
Effective Date and no more than two times during any calendar year, the Borrower
may, by written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each
of the Banks), request at any time or from time to time that the Total
Commitments be increased; provided that (i) the aggregate amount of each such
increase pursuant to this Section shall not be less than $25,000,000 and the
aggregate amount of all such increases pursuant to this Section shall not exceed
$250,000,000, (ii) each such request of the Borrower shall be deemed to be an
offer to each Bank to increase its Commitment by its Applicable Percentage of
the proposed increased amount, and (iii) each Bank, in its sole discretion, may
either (A) agree to increase its Commitment by all or a portion of the offered
amount or (B) decline to increase its Commitment. Any such notice shall set
forth the amount of the requested increase in the Total Commitments and the date
on which such increase is requested to become effective. In the event that the
Banks shall have agreed to increase their Commitments by an aggregate amount
less than the increase in the Total Commitments requested by the Borrower, the
Borrower may arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any
such bank or other financial institution being called an "Augmenting Bank"),
which may include any Bank, to extend Commitments or increase its existing
Commitment in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount; provided
that each Augmenting Bank, if not already a Bank hereunder, shall be subject to
the approval of the Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Increases to and new Commitments created pursuant to this paragraph
(a) shall become effective upon the execution and delivery by the Borrower, the
Agent and any Banks (including any Augmenting Banks) agreeing to increase their
existing Commitments or extend new Commitments, as the case may be, of an
agreement providing for such increased or additional Commitments (a "Commitment
Increase Agreement"), subject to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in
such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Total
Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Bank) shall become effective under this
paragraph unless, on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in
Sections 3.02 (c) and (d) shall be
<PAGE>

                                                                              30

satisfied (as though a Borrowing were being made on such date) and the Agent
shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by
an authorized officer of the Borrower.

            (b) At the time that any increase in the Total Commitments pursuant
to paragraph (a) above (a "Commitment Increase") becomes effective, if any
Committed Loans are outstanding, the Borrower shall prepay the aggregate
principal amount outstanding in respect of such Committed Loans in accordance
with Section 2.12 (the "Initial Loans"); provided that (i) nothing in this
Section shall prevent the Borrower from funding the prepayment of Initial Loans
with concurrent Committed Loans hereunder in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, giving effect to the Commitment Increase, and (ii) no such
prepayment shall be required if, after giving effect to the Commitment Increase,
each Lender has the same Applicable Percentage as immediately prior to such
Commitment Increase.

                                   ARTICLE III

            (b) if requested pursuant to Section 2.06(d), receipt by the Agent
for the account of each applicable Bank of a duly executed Note dated on or

LLP, counsel to the Borrower, substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 hereto;

            (d) receipt by the Agent of written confirmation from the Borrower
that the Borrower has (i) terminated all lending commitments under the Existing
Credit Agreements and (ii) repaid all loans and other amounts, if any,
outstanding or accrued thereunder;

            (e) receipt by the Agent of all documents it may reasonably request

provided that this Agreement shall not become effective or be binding on any
party hereto unless all of the foregoing conditions are satisfied not later than
June 23, 2005. The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of the
Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto.

            SECTION 3.02. Borrowings. The obligation of any Bank to make a Loan
on the occasion of any Borrowing is subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions:

            (a) receipt by the Agent of a Notice of Borrowing as required by
Section 2.02 or 2.03 or receipt of a notice requesting a Swingline Borrowing as

            (b) the fact that, immediately after such Borrowing, (i) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans will not exceed the

the date of such Borrowing, except that the condition set forth in this clause

for any Loans made after the Effective Date.

Each Borrowing hereunder shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by
the Borrower on the date of such Borrowing as to the facts specified in clauses
(b), (c) and (d) of this Section.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         Representations and Warranties

            The Borrower represents and warrants that:

Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article III,
except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the
validity, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, the Loans or any other
instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith. The Agent shall not
incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate,
statement, or other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile
transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by
the proper party or parties.

            SECTION 7.06. Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in
accordance with its Commitment, indemnify the Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel fees
and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as
result from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct) that the Agent
may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any action taken or
omitted by the Agent hereunder.

            SECTION 7.07. Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking any action under this Agreement.

            SECTION 7.08. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent, subject to the approval of the Borrower (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, shall not be required). If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of resignation, then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which
shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $250,000,000 or a commercial bank organized under the laws
of any country which is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, or a political subdivision of any such country, and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000, provided that such bank
is acting through a branch or agency located in the United States. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent.

            SECTION 7.09. Agent's Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Agent.

                                                                              42

            SECTION 7.10. Arrangers; Swingline Lenders. The Borrower and the
Banks acknowledge and agree that (a) Arrangers do not have any duties or
responsibilities hereunder in their capacities as such and (b) Arrangers and
Swingline Lenders shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 7.05 and 7.06 to
the same extent as the Agent.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             Change in Circumstances

            SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or
Unfair. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any
Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan:

            (a) the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks that deposits in the
applicable currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to the
Reference Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or

            (b) in the case of Euro-Dollar Loans, Banks having 50% or more of
the aggregate principal amount of the affected Loans advise the Agent that the
London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Agent will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for
such Interest Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Banks to
make Euro-Dollar Loans or to convert outstanding Loans into or continue
outstanding Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended and (ii) each
outstanding Euro-Dollar Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the
last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto. Unless the
Borrower notifies the Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date
of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been
given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate
Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a
Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market
LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall
bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such
day.

            SECTION 8.02. Illegality. If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change
in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any
Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its
Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall
forthwith

<PAGE>
                                                                              43

give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such
Bank notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to
such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar
Loans, or to convert outstanding Loans into or continue outstanding Loans as
Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Agent
pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice
and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain
and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so
specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then
outstanding principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with
accrued interest thereon. Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar
Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount
from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and
such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

            SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If on or after
(x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to make
Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case
of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or
deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement
imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding
with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an
applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, insurance
assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office)
or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the United
States market for certificates of deposit or the London interbank market any
other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note or its obligation to
make Fixed Rate Loans, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the
cost to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining
any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable
by such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under
its Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material,
then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

            (b) If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof,
the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or any request or directive

<PAGE>
                                                                              44

regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a
consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that which
such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change,
request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from
time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the
Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction. It is understood
that the Banks are entering into this Agreement on the assumption that they will
not be required to maintain capital in respect of their Commitments, and that
the Borrower's obligations under this paragraph will apply in the event such
assumption proves to be incorrect.

            (c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any
event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a
different Applicable Lending Office or attempt to assign its Loans to a
different branch or affiliate of such Bank, as applicable, if such designation
or assignment will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation
under this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount
or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods. The Borrower shall not be obligated to
compensate any Bank pursuant to this Section for increased costs or reduced
return accruing prior to the date which is 90 days before such Bank requests
compensation (in the case of a request for compensation pursuant to subsection
(a) above) or prior to the first day of the most recent fiscal year of such Bank
ending more than 90 days before such Bank requests compensation (in the case of
a request for compensation pursuant to subsection (b) above).

            SECTION 8.04. Taxes. (a) For purposes of this Section 8.04, the
following terms have the following meanings:

            "Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Agent, taxes
imposed on its net income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be)
is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the
case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in
the case of each Bank, any United States withholding tax imposed on such
payments but only (i) to the extent that such Bank is subject to United States
withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes party to this Agreement (or
in the case of any Participant, the time such Participant purchases the relevant
participation) or (ii) where such Bank designates a new lending office, except
to the extent such Bank was entitled, at the time of the designation of a new
lending office, to receive additional

<PAGE>
                                                                              45

amounts from the Borrower with respect to such withholding tax pursuant to this
Section 8.04.

            "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or documentary taxes
and any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which
arise from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from
the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or
any Note.

            (b) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
any Bank or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without
deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 8.04) such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent,
at its address referred to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified copy of
a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

            (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Agent for the
full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section 8.04) paid by such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) and any
liability (including penalties, interest and reasonable expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be paid within 15
days after such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor.

            (d) If a Bank or the Agent shall determine, in its sole discretion,
that it has received a refund from a taxation authority in respect of Taxes or
Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect
to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 8.04,
it shall pay over the amount of such refund to the Borrower, net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of such Bank or the Agent and without interest (other
than interest paid by the relevant taxation authority with respect to such
refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of such Bank or the Agent,
agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest
or other reasonable charges) to such Bank or the Agent in the event such Bank or
the Agent is required to repay such refund to such taxation authority. This
Section shall not be construed to require any Bank or the Agent to make
available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which
it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

            (e) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States (a "Non-U.S. Lender"), on or prior to the date of its execution
and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature
pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case
of each other Bank, (or, in the

<PAGE>
                                                                              46

case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the
related participation), promptly on the obsolescence, expiration, or invalidity
of any form previously delivery by such Non-U.S. Lender, and from time to time
thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such
Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower and the Agent
with one copy of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form
W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly
completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption
from or a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the
Borrower under this Agreement or any Note. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position
to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other
form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).

            (f) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to
provide the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.04(e)
(unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring
subsequent to the date on which such form originally was required to be provided
by such Bank), such Bank shall not be entitled to receive additional amounts or
indemnification under Section 8.04(b) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by
the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or
subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because
of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take
such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover
such Taxes.

            (g) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for
the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.04, then such Bank will
change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of
such Bank, such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional payment
which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise disadvantageous to such
Bank. The Borrower will not be obligated to indemnify any Bank pursuant to
Section 8.04(c) for any amounts payable thereunder accruing more than 90 days
prior to the date that such Bank requests compensation therefor.

            SECTION 8.05. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed Rate
Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Euro-Dollar Loans
has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded
compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans
and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior notice
to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section
shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower
that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation
no longer apply:

            (a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as (or
continued as or converted into) Euro-Dollar Loans shall instead be Base Rate
Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with
the related Fixed Rate Loans of the other Banks), and

<PAGE>
                                                                              47

            (b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid (or
converted to a Base Rate Loan), all payments of principal which would otherwise
be applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base
Rate Loans instead.

            SECTION 8.06. Substitution of Bank. (a) If (i) the obligation of any
Bank to make or maintain Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to
Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank (or any Participant in its Loans) has demanded
compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04, the Borrower shall have the right to
seek a bank or banks ("Substitute Banks"), which may be one or more of the Banks
or one or more other banks satisfactory to the Agent, to purchase the Loan or
Loans and assume the Commitment of such Bank (the "Affected Bank") and, if the
Borrower locates a Substitute Bank, the Affected Bank shall, upon payment to it
of the purchase price agreed between it and the Substitute Bank (or, failing
such agreement, a purchase price in the amount of the outstanding principal
amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon to the date of payment) plus
any amount (other than principal and interest) then due to it or accrued for its
account hereunder, assign all its rights and obligations under this Agreement
and the Notes, (including its Commitment and its Loans) to the Substitute Bank,
and the Substitute Bank shall assume such rights and obligations, whereupon the
Substitute Bank shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the
rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment equal to the Commitment so
assigned and assumed.

            (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, if an
Affected Bank shall have outstanding Money Market Loans at the time it is
required to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any Note
or Notes to a Substitute Bank, such Affected Bank shall not be obligated to so
assign its rights with respect to such Money Market Loans prior to the maturity
date thereof and shall not be obligated to deliver its Note or Notes (if any) to
the Substitute Bank until it shall have received a new Note or Notes from the
Borrower to evidence such Money Market Loans.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  Miscellaneous

            SECTION 9.01. Notices. All notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire,
telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such
party: (x) in the case of the Borrower, any Swingline Lender or the Agent, at
its address or telex or telecopy number set forth on the signature pages hereof,
(y) in the case of any Bank, at its address or telex or telecopy number set
forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (z) in the case of any party, such
other address or telex or telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify
for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the Borrower; provided that notices,
requests and other communications to the Borrower shall not be communicated by
telex. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i)
if given by telex, when such telex is transmitted to the telex number specified
in this Section and the appropriate answerback is received, (ii) if given by
mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first
class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if

<PAGE>
                                                                              48

given by any other means, when delivered at the address or received at the
telecopy number specified in this Section; provided that notices to the Agent
under Article II or Article VIII shall not be effective until received.

            (b) Notices and other communications to the Banks hereunder may be
delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures
approved by the Agent; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to notices
pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Agent and the applicable
Bank. The Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices
and other communications by it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant
to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

            SECTION 9.02. No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Agent or any
Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Loan
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

            SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower shall pay
(i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, including reasonable
fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Agent, in connection with the
preparation of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment
hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of
Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent and each Bank,
including fees and disbursements of counsel, in connection with such Event of
Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings
resulting therefrom.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and hold each Bank
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by any Bank (or by the Agent in
connection with its actions as Agent hereunder) in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Bank
shall be designated a party thereto) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided
that no Bank shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction and shall promptly refund to the Borrower any previous
indemnification payments relating to such action adjudicated to have resulted
from such Bank's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            SECTION 9.04. Sharing of Set-Offs. Each Bank agrees that if it
shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due
with respect to its Loans which are greater than the proportion received by any
other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with
respect to the Loans of such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately
greater payment shall purchase such

<PAGE>
                                                                              49

participation in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments
shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and
interest with respect to the Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the
Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of
any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to
apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the
Borrower other than its indebtedness under the Loans. The Borrower agrees, to
the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
holder of a participation in a Loan acquired pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights
with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation
were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            SECTION 9.05. Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this
Agreement or the Loans may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment
or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks
(and, if the rights or duties of the Agent or a Swingline Lender are affected
thereby, by the Agent or such Swingline Lender, as the case may be); provided
that:

            (a) no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the
Banks, (i) except as contemplated by Section 2.19, increase or decrease the
Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all
Banks) or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the
principal of or rate of interest on any Committed Loan or Swingline Loan or any
fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or
interest on any Committed Loan or Swingline Loan or any fees hereunder or for
any termination of any Commitment, (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments
or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans or the number of Banks,
which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under
this Section or any other provision of this Agreement, or (v) amend, waive or
modify the provisions of this Section 9.05;

            (b) no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by each
affected Bank, (i) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Money
Market Loan, or (ii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or
interest on any Money Market Loan; and

            (c) the approval of Required Banks shall not be required for any
increase in the Total Commitments pursuant to Section 2.19.

            SECTION 9.06. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of all Banks.

            (b) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other
institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or
any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a
participating interest to a

                                                                              50

Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank
shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and
the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest
shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to
enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation,
the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such
Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement
described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.05 without the consent of
the Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent
provided in its participation agreement and subject to the provisions of Section
9.06(e), be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its
participating interest as if such Participant was a Bank. An assignment or other
transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given
effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating
interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

            (c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other
institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part of all (but, in
the case of a partial assignment, not less than a part representing a Commitment
of $10,000,000), of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
Notes (if any), and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations,
pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit F hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and
subject to) the subscribed consent of the Agent and each Swingline Lender (which
consents shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Borrower; provided that (i)
such assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in
respect of outstanding Money Market Loans or, in the case of a Bank that is a
Swingline Lender, its Swingline Commitment and Swingline Loans and (ii) no
consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing. Upon execution and delivery of such
instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount
equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such
Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have
all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such
instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or
action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment
pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Borrower
shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued
to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank
shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in
the amount of $2,000. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date
on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section
8.04.

                                                                              51

            (d) Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment
shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

            (e) A Participant (including any transferee of any Bank's rights
hereunder that is not an Assignee) shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 8.03 or 8.04 than the applicable Bank would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the rights or interests transferred to such
Participant, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written
consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.04
unless (i) (where the Participant is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States) the Borrower is notified of the rights or interests
sold to such Participant and (ii) such Participant agrees, for the benefit of
the Borrower, to comply with Section 8.04 as though it were a Bank.

            SECTION 9.07. Collateral. Each of the Banks represents to the Agent
and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not relying upon any
"margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or
maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.08. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This
Agreement and each Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City
for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

            SECTION 9.09. Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

            SECTION 9.10. Confidentiality. Any information disclosed by the
Borrower to the Agent or any of the Banks, which was either (x) so disclosed on
or before the Effective Date or (y) designated proprietary or confidential at
the time of receipt thereof by the Agent or such Bank, if such information is
not otherwise in the public domain, shall not be disclosed by the Agent or such
Bank to any other Person except (i) to its directors, officers, employees and
agents, including its independent accountants and legal counsel (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such
information confidential), (ii) pursuant to statutory and regulatory
requirements, (iii) pursuant to any mandatory court order, subpoena or other
legal

<PAGE>
                                                                              52

process, (iv) to the Agent or any other Bank, (v) pursuant to any agreement
heretofore or hereafter made between such Bank and the Borrower which permits
such disclosure, (vi) in connection with the exercise of any remedy under this
Agreement or the Notes or (vii) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to any participant in or
assignee of, or prospective participant in or assignee of, any Loan or
Commitment. The provisions of this Section 9.10 shall be deemed satisfied by
each Bank if and to the extent such Bank shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the data or information referred to
above, exercising the same degree of care that such Bank would accord to its own
confidential information or documents.

            SECTION 9.11. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Bank hereby notifies the
Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), such Bank is required to
obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information
that will allow such Bank to identify the Borrower in accordance with said Act.

            SECTION 9.12. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE AGENT
AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

            SECTION 9.13. Waiver of Notice of Termination Under Existing Credit
Agreements. Each bank that is a "Bank" under (and as defined in) the Existing
Credit Agreements hereby waives any requirement under the Existing Credit
Agreements that notice be given by The Chubb Corporation prior to the prepayment
of loans or termination of commitments thereunder; provided that such
commitments are terminated by notice by The Chubb Corporation to the Banks under
the Existing Credit Agreements on the Effective Date.

_______________ (the "Bank"), for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,
the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by the Bank to the Borrower
pursuant to the Credit Agreement referred to below on the last day of the
Interest Period relating to such Loan. The Borrower promises to pay interest on

            All Loans made by the Bank, the respective types and maturities
thereof and all repayments of the principal thereof shall be recorded by the
Bank and, prior to any transfer hereof, appropriate notations to evidence the
foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding shall be
endorsed by the Bank on the schedule attached hereto, or on a continuation of
such schedule attached to and made a part hereof; provided that the failure of
the Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement.

            This note is one of the Notes referred to in the Five Year Revolving
Credit Agreement dated as of June 22, 2005, among the Borrower, the banks listed

      (the"Borrower"), and not in any individual or other capacity, in
      connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit
      Agreement by the Borrower.

      I have examined and relied upon originals or copies of corporate documents
      and records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and officers
      of the Borrower and such other documents and instruments as I have deemed
      necessary or appropriate for purposes of rendering the opinions expressed
      below. In addition, I have made such other investigations of law and
      inquiries of officers of the Borrower as I have deemed necessary or
      appropriate. I have assumed, without verifying, the authenticity of all
      documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic
      original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified,conformed
      or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such
      documents. As to matters material to my opinions, I have relied upon
      representations of the Borrower, including those set forth in the Credit

      Based upon the foregoing, it is my opinion that (i) the Borrower is
      validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New

      the Credit Agreement and the Notes (a) are within the Borrower's corporate
      powers, (b) have been duly authorized by the requisite corporate action,
      and (c) do not contravene the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
      the Borrower; and (iii) the Borrower has duly executed and delivered the
      Credit Agreement.

      I am a member of the bar of the State of New Jersey. I express no opinion
      with respect to any matters governed by any law other than the corporate
      laws of the State of New Jersey.

      The foregoing opinions are rendered to you solely in connection with the
      matter described in the initial paragraph of this letter. The opinions
      expressed herein may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or

      to below, Citicorp USA, Inc.,
      and Deutsche Bank AG
      New York Branch, as Agent

     Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  We have acted as special counsel to The Chubb Corporation, a
      New Jersey corporation (the "Borrower"), in connection with the Five Year
      Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of June 22,
      2005, among the Borrower, the financial institutions listed on the
      signature pages of the Credit Agreement (the "Lenders"), Deutsche Bank AG
      New York Branch, as Agent (the "Agent"), Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and
      Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as arrangers, Deutsche Bank AG New York
      Branch and Citicorp USA, Inc., as swingline lenders, and Citicorp USA,
      Inc., as syndication agent. This opinion is being furnished to you at the
      request of the

                                                                               2

PAUL, WEISS, RIFKIND, WHARTON & GARRISON LLP

      Borrower as provided by Section 3.01(c) of the Credit Agreement.
      Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined have the respective
      meanings given those terms in the Credit Agreement.

                  In connection with this opinion, we have examined an original,
      or a copy certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction,of the
      Credit Agreement.

                  In addition, we have examined those other certificates,
      agreements and documents that we deemed relevant and necessary as a basis
      for our opinion. We have also relied upon the factual matters contained in
      the representations and warranties of the Borrower made in the Credit
      Agreement and upon certificates of public officials and the Borrower.

                  In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have
      assumed, without independent investigation,the genuineness of all
      signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have executed any of
      the documents reviewed by us, the authenticity of all documents submitted
      to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all documents
      submitted to us as certified, photostatic, reproduced or conformed copies
      of valid existing agreements or other documents, the authenticity of the
      latter documents and that the statements regarding matters of fact in the
      certificates, records, agreements, instruments and documents that we have
      examined are accurate and complete. We have also assumed, without
      independent investigation, the enforceability of the Credit Agreement
      against each party other than the Borrower.

                  In addition,in the case of Borrower, we have assumed, without
      independent investigation, that (i) it is validly existing and in good
      standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) it has
      all necessary corporate power and

<PAGE>

                                                                               3

PAUL, WEISS, RIFKIND, WHARTON & GARRISON LLP

      authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit
      Agreement, (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit
      Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
      do not violate its charter or other organizational documents or the laws
      of its jurisdiction of organization and (iv) the Credit Agreement has been
      duly executed and delivered by it under the laws of its jurisdiction of
      organization.

                  Whenever we indicate that our opinion is based upon our
      knowledge or words of similar import, our opinion is based solely on an
      officer's certificate of the Borrower and without any independent
      verification or investigation.

                  Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions,
      exceptions and qualifications stated below, we are of the opinion that:

                  1. The Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
      binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in
      accordance with its terms.

                  2. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit
      Agreement and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the
      Credit Agreement do not (i) violate any Covered Law (as defined below)
      (including Regulations U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
      Reserve System of the United States), or (ii) violate any order, writ,
      injunction or decree of which we have knowledge of any court or
      governmental authority or agency binding upon the Borrower or to which the
      Borrower is subject.

                  3. Except for any filings, authorizations or approvals as are
      specifically provided for in the Credit Agreement, no authorizations or
      approvals of, and

<PAGE>

                                                                               4

PAUL, WEISS, RIFKIND, WHARTON GARRISON & LLP

      no filings with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency are
      necessary under any Covered Law for the execution, delivery or performance
      by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement.

                  4. The Borrower is not required to be registered as an
      "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
      1940, as amended.

                  5. To our knowledge, there are no legal proceedings pending or
      overtly threatened against the Borrower which are reasonably likely to
      have a Material Adverse Effect on the Borrower taken as a whole or on the
      validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement.

                  This opinion is subject to the following assumptions,
      exceptions and qualifications:

                     (a) The enforceability of the Credit Agreement may be: (i)
      subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance
      or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
      generally; and (ii)subject to general principles of equity (regardless of
      whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

                     (b) We express no opinion as to: (i) the enforceability of
      any provisions contained in the Credit Agreement that purport to establish
      (or may be construed to establish) evidentiary standards, or (ii)the
      enforceability of forum selection clauses in the federal courts.

                  This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York
      and the federal laws of the United States of America that, in each case,
      in our experience, are normally applicable to credit transactions of the
      type contemplated by the Credit

                                                                               5

      Agreement, but excluding federal and state insurance laws (collectively,
      the "Covered Laws"). This opinion is rendered only with respect to the
      laws, and the rules, regulations and orders under those laws, that are
      currently in effect.

                  This opinion is furnished by us solely for your benefit in
      connection with the transactions referred to in the Credit Agreement and
      may not be circulated to, or relied upon by, any other Person, except that
      it may be circulated to any prospective Lender in accordance with the
      Credit Agreement and may be relied upon by any person who, in the future,
      becomes a Lender.

                              Very truly yours,

                        AGREEMENT dated as of      , 20__ among [ASSIGNOR] (the

                  CORPORATION (the "Borrower") and DEUTSCHE BANK AG NEW YORK
                  BRANCH, as Administrative Agent (the "Agent").

                               W I T N E S S E T H

            WHEREAS this Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the "Agreement")
relates to the Five Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of June 22, 2005,

            WHEREAS, as provided under the Credit Agreement, the Assignor has a
Commitment to make Loans to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not to exceed $___________;

            WHEREAS, Committed Loans made to the Borrower by the Assignor under
the Credit Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $__________ are
outstanding at the date hereof; and

            WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the Assignee all of the
rights of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement in respect of a portion of its
Commitment thereunder in an amount equal to $ (the "Assigned Amount"), together
with a corresponding portion of its outstanding Committed Loans, and the
Assignee proposes to accept assignment of such rights and assume the
corresponding obligations from the Assignor on such terms;

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

            SECTION 1. Definitions. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.

            SECTION 2. Assignment. The Assignor hereby assigns and sells to the
Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the
extent of the Assigned Amount, and the Assignee hereby accepts such assignment
from the Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of the Assignor under the
Credit Agreement to the extent of the Assigned Amount, including the purchase
from the Assignor of the corresponding portion of the principal amount of the
Committed Loans made by the Assignor outstanding at the date hereof. Upon the
execution and delivery hereof by the Assignor, the Assignee, the Borrower and
the Agent and the payment of the amounts specified in Section 3 required to be
paid on the date hereof (i) the Assignee shall, as of

<PAGE>

                                                                               2

the date hereof, succeed to the rights and be obligated to perform the
obligations of a Bank under the Credit Agreement with a Commitment in an amount
equal to the Assigned Amount, and (ii) the Commitment of the Assignor shall, as
of the date hereof, be reduced by a like amount and the Assignor released from
its obligations under the Credit Agreement to the extent such obligations have
been assumed by the Assignee. The assignment provided for herein shall be
without recourse to the Assignor.

            SECTION 3. Payments. As consideration for the assignment and sale
contemplated in Section 2 hereof, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the
date hereof in Federal funds an amount equal to $ (1). It is understood that
facility fees accrued to the date hereof are for the account of the Assignor and
such fees accruing from and including the date hereof are for the account of the
Assignee. Each of the Assignor and the Assignee hereby agrees that if it
receives any amount under the Credit Agreement which is for the account of the
other party hereto, it shall receive the same for the account of such other
party to the extent of such other party's interest therein and shall promptly
pay the same to such other party.

            SECTION 4. Consent of the Borrower and the Agent. This Agreement is
conditioned upon the consent of the Borrower and the Agent pursuant to Section
9.06(c) of the Credit Agreement. The execution of this Agreement by the Borrower
and the Agent is evidence of this consent. Pursuant to Section 9.06(c) the
Borrower agrees, if requested, to execute and deliver a Note payable to the
order of the Assignee to evidence the assignment and assumption provided for
herein.

representation or warranty in connection with, and shall have no responsibility
with respect to, the solvency, financial condition, or statements of the
Borrower, or the validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower
in respect of the Credit Agreement or any Note. The Assignee acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance on the Assignor, and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and will continue to be
responsible for making its own independent appraisal of the business, affairs
and financial condition of the Borrower.

            SECTION 6. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

            SECTION 7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

-----------------
      (1) Amount should combine principal together with accrued interest and
breakage compensation, if any, to be paid by the Assignee, net of any portion of
any upfront fee to be paid by the Assignor to the Assignee. It may be preferable
in an appropriate case to specify these amounts generically or by formula rather
than as a fixed sum.
