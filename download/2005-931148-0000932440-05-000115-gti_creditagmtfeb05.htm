2.11. <U>Fees.</U> (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the
daily unused amount of each Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including
the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued
commitment fees in respect of any Commitment shall be payable in arrears (i) on the last
day of March, June, September and December of each year commencing on the first such date
to occur after the date hereof, and (ii) on the date on which such Commitment terminates.
All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees with respect to Revolving
Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent
of the LC Exposure of such Lender, but not by the Swingline Exposure of such Lender. For
purposes of computing the average daily amount of any LC Exposure for any period under
this Section 2.11(a), the average daily amount of the Alternative Currency LC Exposure for
such period shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the average daily balance of each
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (expressed in the currency in which such Alternative
Currency Letter of Credit is denominated) by (ii) the Exchange Rate for each such
Alternative Currency in effect on the last Business Day of such period or by such other
reasonable method that the Administrative Agent deems appropriate, in consultation with
the Borrower. </FONT></P>

Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure (and any
such fees remaining unpaid after the Revolving Maturity Date or earlier termination of the

Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All
participation fees and fronting fees payable under this paragraph shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing the
average daily amount of any LC Exposure for any period under this Section 2.11(b), the
average daily amount of the Alternative Currency LC Exposure for such period shall be

would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the

is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and

Class not so benefited (it being agreed that no provision requiring the Borrower

0.25% lower at any time and in any circumstances than the Applicable Rate used
to determine interest rates applicable to such new Class. The loans, commitments
and borrowings of any Class established pursuant to this paragraph shall
constitute Loans, Commitments and Borrowings under, and shall be entitled to all
the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and

Guarantees and security interests and Liens created by the Guarantee Agreement

required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or demonstrate that the
Collateral and Guarantee Requirement continues to be satisfied after the

10.14. <U>Release of Liens and Guarantees.</U> In the event that any Loan Party or other
Subsidiary disposes of any asset in a transaction not prohibited by Section&nbsp;7.05, the
Agents are hereby directed and authorized to take such action and execute such documents
as the Borrower may reasonably request, at the Borrower&#146;s sole expense, to release
any Lien on such asset created by any Loan Document and, if the asset disposed of is a
portion of the Capital Stock of any Guarantor or CFC Guarantor that is owned by the Loan
Parties and the Subsidiaries that will result in such Guarantor or CFC Guarantor ceasing
to be a Subsidiary after giving effect to such disposition, to release any Guarantee of
such Guarantor or CFC Guarantor under any Guarantee Agreement. Any representation,
warranty, covenant or condition contained in any Loan Document relating to any such
Capital Stock, asset or Subsidiary shall no longer be deemed to be made or applicable once
such Capital Stock or asset is disposed of as described above. In addition, the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent agree to take such actions as are reasonably
requested by the Borrower and at the Borrower&#146;s expense to terminate the Liens and
security interests created by the Loan Documents when all the Obligations have been paid
in full and all Letters of Credit and Commitments have been terminated or have expired. </FONT></P>

any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another
currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so,

Currency,           the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking
procedures in the           relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with
the Judgment           Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is
less than the           sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement
Currency, the           Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any
such judgment,           to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss. The
obligations of the           Borrower contained in this Section 10.15 shall survive the
