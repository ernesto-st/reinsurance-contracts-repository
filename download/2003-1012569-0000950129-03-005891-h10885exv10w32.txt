                                     CLOSING

         Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Article 2 (the "Closing") will take place at
the time and place provided for in the Contribution Agreement, on the third
Business Day following the date on which the last of the conditions to Closing
set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied or waived by the party or
parties entitled to waive the same, provided that the Closing shall be deemed to
be effective after the closings of the transactions contemplated by the
Acquisition Agreement and the Contribution Agreement (the "Closing Date").
Except for purposes of Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, all Closing transactions will
be deemed to have occurred simultaneously.

         2.1 AGREED HHI CASH AMOUNT.

         (a)      Not later than the close of business on the fourth trading day
preceding the Closing, US Propane shall deliver to the Buyer a statement ("Base
Statement") of the cash and cash equivalents held and expected to be held in the
accounts of HHI immediately prior to the Closing, if and to the extent such cash
and cash equivalents exceed the Current Liabilities of HHI expected to be
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (the amount of such excess cash and
cash equivalents, the "HHI Cash"); provided, however, that neither the cash and
cash equivalents set aside for the payment of any current liabilities relating
to estimated tax payments due or payable by HHI or payments due under the Net
Worth Note, nor the current liabilities attributable to such estimated tax
payments, shall be taken into account for the purposes of determining HHI Cash.
As used herein, the term "Current Liabilities of HHI" shall be calculated in
accordance with Schedule 2.1(a), and shall exclude, without limitation, any
deferred Tax obligation of HHI, any Taxes to the extent subject to an indemnity
obligation of Sellers in Section 6.7 (other than accrued and unpaid income taxes
payable for any cash distributions received by HHI on its Common Units prior to
the Closing), any intercompany accounts to the extent eliminated in accordance
with Section 6.12, any current maturities of long-term debt of HHI, the
obligations of HHI under the Distribution Note and the obligation of HHI to pay
the dividend of the Net Worth Note in accordance with Section 6.13.

         (b)      During the period that commences upon the Distribution and
ends immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers will cause HHI to declare and
pay a dividend equal in aggregate amount to the HHI Cash, such dividend to be
declared and paid in cash prior to the Closing to

                                       4
<PAGE>

NewLP or the Sellers, in their respective capacities as the stockholder(s) of
HHI (as the case may be), pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership
interests.

         (c)      Within 45 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers a statement (the "Closing Statement"), which shall set
forth in reasonable detail (A) the HHI Cash amount immediately prior to the
Closing based upon a detailed balance sheet prepared consistent with the balance
sheet used to prepare the Base Statement and (B) a calculation of the additional
amount payable to, or payable by, Sellers based upon the difference between the
HHI Cash reflected in the Base Statement and the HHI Cash reflected in the
Closing Statement. The Sellers agree, at no cost to Buyer, to give Buyer and its
authorized representatives reasonable access (provided that in their sole
discretion Sellers or their representatives may accompany Buyer and its
representatives) to such employees, officers and other facilities and such books
and records of Sellers as are reasonably necessary to allow Buyer and its
authorized representatives to prepare the Closing Statement. The Base Statement
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (as defined in Exhibit 1.1) and on a
basis consistent with the Financial Statements using the same accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures and adjustments as were used in the
preparation of the Financial Statements. The Closing Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements,
using the same accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures and
adjustments as were used in the preparation of the Base Statement.

         (d)      Following its receipt from Buyer of the Closing Statement, the
Sellers shall have 30 days to review the Closing Statement and to inform Buyer
in writing of any disagreement which they may have with the Closing Statement,
which objection (i) shall specify in reasonable detail the Sellers' disagreement
with the Closing Statement and (ii) shall include a detailed adjusted balance
sheet prepared as of the Closing Date reflecting the adjustments and changes
requested by Seller (the "Objection"). Buyer agrees, at no cost to the Sellers,
to give the Sellers and their authorized representatives reasonable access to
such employees, officers and other facilities and such books and records of HHI
as are reasonably necessary to allow Sellers and their authorized
representatives to review and confirm the Closing Statement prepared by Buyer.
If Buyer does not receive the Objection within such 30-day period, the amount of
HHI Cash set forth on the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
shall be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers and shall become binding upon
Sellers. If Sellers do timely deliver an Objection to Buyer, Buyer shall then
have 10 Business Days from the date of receipt of such Objection (the "Review
Period") to review and respond to the Objection. Buyer and Sellers shall attempt
in good faith to resolve any disagreements with respect to the determination of
HHI Cash immediately prior to the Closing. If they are unable to resolve all of
their disagreements with respect to the determination of such HHI Cash within 10
Business Days following the expiration of Buyer's Review Period, they may refer,
at the option of either Buyer or Sellers, their differences to KPMG or if KPMG
declines to accept such engagement, a nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants selected jointly by Buyer and Sellers, who shall determine
only with respect to the differences so submitted, whether and to what extent,
if any, the amount of HHI Cash immediately prior to the Closing set forth in the
Closing Statement requires adjustment. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to so
select the independent public accountants within five Business Days of KPMG
declining to accept such engagement, either Buyer or Sellers may thereafter
request that the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution make such selection (as
applicable, KPMG, the firm selected by Buyer and Sellers or the firm selected by

                                       5
<PAGE>

the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution is referred to as the "CPA Firm").
Buyer and Sellers shall direct the CPA Firm to use its reasonable best efforts
to render its determination within 30 days after the issue is first submitted to
the CPA Firm. The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
Buyer and Sellers. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared
equally by Buyer and Sellers. Buyer and Sellers shall make readily available to
the CPA Firm all relevant books and records relating to the Closing Statement
and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The Closing Statement
as agreed to by Buyer and Sellers or as determined by the CPA Firm shall be
referred to as the "Final Closing Statement."

         (e)      If the HHI Cash on the Final Closing Statement exceeds the HHI
Cash reflected in the Base Statement, then Buyer shall pay to Sellers in cash
the amount of such excess. If the HHI Cash reflected in the Base Statement
exceeds the HHI Cash on the Final Closing Statement, then Sellers shall pay to
Buyer in cash the amount of such excess. All amounts payable under this Section
2.1(e) shall be paid within three Business Days of the determination of the
Final Closing Statement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account in the United States of America designated in writing by the
recipient not less than one Business Day before such payment.

         2.2 PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE.

         (a)      At the Closing in exchange for the HHI Stock, the Buyer will
pay to NewLP, in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) below, a total of
$100,000,000.00 the "Closing Consideration"). The Closing Consideration shall be
paid as follows:

                  (i)      Buyer will pay to NewLP by wire transfer of
                           immediately available funds (to an account designated
                           by NewLP to Buyer not later than three Business Days
                           before Closing by NewLP to Buyer) a total of
                           $50,000,000.00 (the "Cash Purchase Price"); and

                  (ii)     Buyer will deliver to NewLP a fully executed
                           promissory note of Buyer payable to the order of
                           NewLP or its successors and assigns in the original
                           principal amount of $50,000,000.00, such promissory
                           note to be in the form attached as Annex I hereto
                           (the "Promissory Note"), and the payment of which
                           shall be secured by a pledge from Buyer of the HHI
                           Stock purchased by Buyer, such pledge to be in the
                           form attached as Annex II hereto (the "Pledge
                           Agreement").

         (b)      In consideration for the payment by the Buyer to NewLP of the
Closing Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a) above, NewLP or Sellers will
deliver to the Buyer stock certificates, duly endorsed in blank and accompanied
by a stock power, evidencing all of the HHI Stock, such shares of HHI Stock to
be delivered free and clear of any Encumbrance other than any Encumbrance
arising under the Pledge Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 3
          REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF US PROPANE AND THE SELLERS

         For the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Sellers, severally but
not jointly, and US Propane represent and warrant as set forth in this Article
3.

         3.1 ORGANIZATION OF HHI. HHI has been duly incorporated and is validly
existing in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of
Delaware with full corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties
and to conduct its business, in each case in all material respects as conducted
on the date hereof. HHI is duly registered or qualified as a foreign corporation
for the transaction of business under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the
character of the business conducted by it or the nature or location of the
properties owned or leased by it makes such registration or qualification
necessary, except where the failure so to register or qualify would not have an
HHI Material Adverse Effect.

         3.2 CAPITALIZATION OF HHI.

         (a)      On the date of this Agreement there are, and immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement there will be,
534,787.841 shares of HHI Stock issued and outstanding, all of which are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned beneficially and of record on
the date of this Agreement by US Propane free and clear of any Encumbrance,
other than Encumbrances arising under this Agreement. US Propane will continue
to own the HHI Stock until such time as US Propane effects the Distribution of
the HHI Stock to NewLP, at which time such share of HHI Stock will be owned by
NewLP free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than Encumbrances arising under
this Agreement. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2(a) and except for the
obligations contained in this Agreement (including the Distribution Note to be
issued prior to Closing), there are no outstanding securities of HHI other than
the HHI Stock and no subscriptions, options, convertible securities, warrants,
calls or rights of any kind (issued or granted by, or binding upon, HHI, US
Propane or any of the Sellers) to purchase or otherwise acquire any security of
or equity interest in HHI.

         (b)      Except for the obligations in respect of the Net Worth Note or
as described on Schedule 3.2(b) there is no existing or outstanding indebtedness
or other obligation of US Propane or any of the Sellers owing to HHI.

         3.3 AUTHORITY AND CAPACITY. US Propane and each of the Sellers have all
right, power, authority and capacity necessary to enter into this Agreement and
the other Operative Agreements. Subject to the declaration of the Distribution
by USP GP, US Propane has all right, power, authority and capacity necessary to
effect the Distribution. Upon receipt of the shares of HHI Stock in the
Distribution, NewLP will have all right, power, authority and capacity necessary
to sell, convey, transfer and deliver in accordance with this Agreement the
shares of HHI Stock to be received by NewLP in the Distribution. Except for the
approvals required to complete the Pre-Closing Transactions, no consent or
approval of any Person (other than the termination or lapse of the applicable
waiting period that may be applicable under the HSR Act) is necessary for US
Propane or any of the Sellers to approve this Agreement, or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Operative Agreements. This
Agreement and the Operative Agreements to be executed at the Closing will be
effective at the Closing to

                                       7
<PAGE>

transfer to Buyer all of the Sellers' interests in, right to, and ownership of
the shares of HHI Stock, free and clear of any Encumbrance, without the approval
or execution of any other Person.

         3.4 BINDING AGREEMENT. This Agreement has been, and each of the
Operative Agreements to be executed by any of the Sellers or US Propane will be,
duly executed and delivered by each of the Sellers and US Propane, and
constitutes the valid and legally binding agreement of each of the Sellers and
US Propane, enforceable against each of the Sellers and US Propane in accordance
with its terms; provided that the enforceability hereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law) and except as rights to indemnity and
contribution hereunder may be limited by federal or state securities laws.

         3.5 NO BREACH OR VIOLATION. None of the execution, delivery and
performance by the Sellers or US Propane of (a) this Agreement or (b) the
Operative Agreements to which any of the Sellers or US Propane is a party (i)
conflicts or will conflict with or constitutes or will constitute a violation of
the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of any of the Sellers or US Propane, (ii) constitutes or will
constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such an event), any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument
to which any of the Sellers or US Propane is a party or by which any of them or
any of their respective properties may be bound, other than as set forth on
Schedule 3.5, (iii) violates or will violate any statute, law or regulation or
any order, judgment, decree or injunction of any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority directed to HHI or any of the Sellers or US Propane or any of their
properties in a proceeding to which any of them or their property is a party
except as have been or will be obtained prior to Closing under the HSR Act or
(iv) will result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any
property or assets of HHI (other than an Encumbrance arising under the Pledge
Agreement), which conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults, in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii), would have an HHI Material Adverse Effect.

         3.6 NO CONSENTS. Except as may be obtained under the HSR Act, no
permit, consent, approval, authorization, order, registration, filing or
qualification of or with any Governmental Authority is required (a) in
connection with the execution and delivery by any of the Sellers or US Propane
of this Agreement or the other Operative Agreements to which any of them is
party, or (b) the consummation by any of the Sellers or US Propane of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement or the other Operative Agreements.

         3.7 NO VIOLATION. None of HHI, the Sellers or US Propane is in (i)
violation of its certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents, (ii) violation of any law, statute, ordinance,
administrative or governmental rule or regulation applicable to it or of any
decree of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over it or (iii)
breach, default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default) or violation in the performance of any obligation,
agreement or condition contained in any bond, debenture, note or any other
evidence of indebtedness or in any agreement, indenture, lease or other
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be
bound,

                                       8
<PAGE>

which breach, default or violation in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) would, if
continued, have an HHI Material Adverse Effect.

         3.8 NO PROCEEDINGS. There is (i) no Proceeding before or by any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator or official, domestic or foreign, now
pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers or US Propane, threatened, to which
any of the Sellers or US Propane or any of its assets is or may be a party or to
which the business or property of any of HHI or any of its assets is or may be
subject, (ii) no statute, rule, regulation or order that has been enacted,
adopted or issued by any Governmental Authority or that has been proposed by any
Governmental Authority, (iii) no injunction, restraining order or order of any
nature issued by a federal or state court or foreign court of competent
jurisdiction to which HHI or any of its assets is or may be subject, and (iv) no
Proceeding, injunction, restraining order or order of any nature before or by
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator that affects any of HHI, the Sellers or
US Propane in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement, this Agreement or the Acquisition Agreement, that, in the case of
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, is reasonably expected to (A)
individually or in the aggregate have an HHI Material Adverse Effect, (B)
prevent or result in the suspension of the sale of the HHI Stock to the Buyer as
contemplated herein or (C) draw into question in any manner the validity of this
Agreement or any of the other Operative Agreements.

         3.9 LISTING. The HHI Stock is not listed for trading on any stock
exchange.

         3.10 FINDER'S FEES. None of HHI, the Sellers or US Propane is obligated
(directly or indirectly) under any agreement with any Person that would obligate
the Buyer, HHI or any of their respective Affiliates to pay any commission,
brokerage or "finder's fee" in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein.

         3.11 BUSINESS PERMITS. HHI has, or at the Closing Date will have, such
Permits as are necessary to own its properties and to conduct its business as
currently conducted, except for such Permits which, if not obtained, would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an HHI Material Adverse Effect; HHI has,
or at the Closing Date will have, fulfilled and performed all its material
obligations with respect to such Permits, and no event has occurred which
allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination
thereof or results in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any such
Permit, except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that would not
have an HHI Material Adverse Effect; and none of such Permits contains any
restriction that is materially burdensome to HHI.

         3.12 BOOKS AND RECORDS. To the knowledge of the Sellers and US Propane,
HHI (i) makes and keeps books, records and accounts, which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
assets and (ii) maintains systems of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that (A) transactions are executed in accordance
with management's general or specific authorization; (B) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (C) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with
existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences.

         3.13 TAXES.

         (a)      Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(a), HHI has filed all
material Tax Returns required to be filed with the IRS and any other applicable
taxing authority through the date hereof, which returns are complete and correct
in all material respects, and has timely paid or has provided an accrual on the
Financial Statements for all Taxes due pursuant to such returns, other than
those (i) which, if not paid, would not have an HHI Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) which are being contested in good faith and disclosed in Schedule 3.13(a).
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(a), HHI is not currently the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any Tax Returns.

         (b)      Schedule 3.13(b) lists all federal, state, local and foreign
income Tax Returns filed with respect to HHI and any affiliated, consolidated,
combined, unitary or similar group of which HHI is or was a member for the two
taxable years prior to the date hereof and indicates those Tax Returns that are
the subject of an audit as of the date hereof. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.13(b), there are no audits or investigations by any taxing authority in
progress nor have Sellers or HHI received any notice from any taxing authority
that it intends to conduct such an audit or investigation. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.13(b), no claim has been made by a taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where HHI does not file Tax Returns such that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. HHI has not waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

         (c)      There are no liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of HHI
other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable.

         (d)      HHI has no liability for Taxes other than those incurred in
the ordinary course of business and in respect of which adequate reserves are
being maintained on the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.

         (e)      HHI has not made any material payments, is not obligated to
make any material payments and is not a party to any agreement that under
certain circumstances could obligate it to make any material payments that will
not be deductible under Code Section 280G.

         (f)      HHI has not been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable
period specified in Code Section 897(c)(l)(A)(ii).

         (g)      Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.13(g), since August 10,
2000, HHI (i) has not been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return and (ii) does not have any liability for Taxes of any
Person (other than US Propane or a Heritage Entity) under Treas. Reg. Section 1.
1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise, excluding liability for

violation of, or a default under (or an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute such an event), any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Buyer
or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties may be bound, (iii) assuming
compliance with Section 4.5, violates or will violate any statute, law or

adverse effect upon the condition (financial or other), business, prospects,
properties, net worth or results of operations of the Buyer and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "Buyer Material Adverse Effect").

         4.5 CONSENTS. No permit, consent, approval, authorization, order,
registration, filing or qualification of or with any Governmental Authority is

Propane to pay any commission, brokerage or "finder's fee" in connection with
the transactions contemplated herein.

         4.8 INVESTMENT INTENT. The HHI Stock to be acquired by Buyer will be
acquired for the account of the Buyer for investment only and not for the
benefit of any other Person or with a view toward resale or redistribution in a
manner that could require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the Buyer does not now have any reason to anticipate any change in
the Buyer's circumstances or other particular occasion or event that would cause
the Buyer to sell such HHI Stock.

             ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, unless
             such delay is due to a good faith dispute as to liability or
             amount;

                  (xi)     permit any current insurance or reinsurance or

             the Sellers or US Propane untrue as of any time from the date of
             this Agreement to the date of the Closing, or would result in any
             of the conditions set forth in this Agreement not being satisfied;

and (b) after completing the Pre-Closing Restructuring and prior to the Closing
HHI shall declare the dividends specified in Section 6.13, which dividends shall
be paid as specified in such Section 6.13.

necessary to comply with applicable securities laws and notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary or in any other agreement to which a party
hereto is bound, the parties hereto (and each employee, representative, or other

persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income "tax treatment"
and "tax structure" (as those terms are defined in Treas. Reg. Sections

Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax

"tax structure" of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For these
purposes, "tax structure" is limited to facts relevant to the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of the transaction described herein.

                                   ARTICLE 6
                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         Each of the Sellers, severally but not jointly, and US Propane hereby
covenant and agree with the Buyer as set forth in this Article 6.

         6.1 ACCESS TO INFORMATION, CONFIDENTIALITY. Between the date hereof and
the Closing, US Propane and the Sellers shall cause HHI (i) to give the Buyer
and its Affiliates and authorized representatives reasonable access to all
employees of HHI and all facilities and all books and records relating to HHI's
business, (ii) to permit the Buyer and its Affiliates and authorized
representatives to make such inspections of HHI's business and assets as they
may reasonably require to verify the accuracy of any representation or warranty
contained in Article 3 and (iii) to furnish the Buyer and its Affiliates and
authorized representatives with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to HHI's business and assets as any such Party may from
time to time reasonably request and as is available to US Propane or the Sellers
without undue effort or expense; provided, however, that the Sellers shall have
the right to have a representative present at all times of any such inspections
or examinations conducted at the offices or other facilities of HHI.

                                       16
<PAGE>

         6.2 THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. Between the date hereof and the Closing,
Buyer, US Propane and the Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain all consents from third parties required for Buyer, US Propane
and the Sellers to perform their obligations hereunder. If the parties hereto
agree that a filing under the HSR Act is necessary or appropriate in respect of
this Agreement and the Other Operative Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby within five Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, use their commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
waiting period under the HSR Act to expire as quickly as possible and to supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party
hereto shall have any obligation to dispose of, hold separate or otherwise
restrict its enjoyment of any of their assets or properties in order to obtain
requisite approvals pursuant to the HSR Act. "Commercially reasonable best
efforts" or any phrase of similar tenor as used in this Agreement or any other
Operative Agreement shall mean such good faith efforts as are commercially
reasonable, comparing the cost and expense of the efforts to the benefit to be
gained (without regard to the identity of the beneficiary).

         6.3 RELEASE OF LIENS. Between the date hereof and the Closing, US
Propane and the Sellers shall obtain full releases of any Encumbrances on the
HHI Stock.

         6.4 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Between the date hereof and the Closing,
except as may be required by Applicable Law or stock exchange rule, none of the
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall issue any
press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of each of the other Parties. Any press release or other public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be mutually agreed upon by the Buyer, the Sellers and US Propane.

         6.5 ACCESS TO RECORDS AFTER CLOSING. For a period of six years from and
after the Closing Date, each of the Sellers and their representatives shall have
reasonable access to inspect and copy all books and records relating to HHI's
business to the extent that such access may reasonably be required in connection
with matters relating to or affected by the operation of HHI's business prior to
the Closing, provided, however, that the Buyer shall have the right to have a
representative present at all times of any such inspection conducted by Sellers.
The Buyer shall afford such access upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and
during normal business hours. If the Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of
such books and records prior to the expiration of such period, the Buyer shall,
prior to such disposition, give the Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at their
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as they may select. Each
Party shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this Section 6.5.

         6.6 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each of the Sellers, US Propane and the Buyer shall pay its own fees
and expenses (including (a) its individual or internal company expenses, as the
case may be, including all salaries and expenses of its employees performing
legal or accounting duties and (b) the fees and expenses of counsel, financial
advisors, accountants and others engaged by such Party) incurred in connection
with

                                       17
<PAGE>

the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other Operative
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether or not
the Closing shall have occurred. It is specifically agreed that any fees and
expenses of the Special Committee of the Board of US Propane, its counsel, and
its investment advisors will be an expense of Buyer.

         6.7 TAXES; OTHER CHARGES.

         (a)      Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely
filed all Tax Returns for HHI for all tax periods ending prior to the Book Close
which are filed after the Book Close (a "Pre-Closing Period"). For purposes of
this Section 6.7, Book Close shall mean December 1, 2003, unless the Closing
Date is prior to December 1, 2003, in which event Book Close shall mean the
Closing Date. Subject to Section 6.7(b), Sellers shall timely pay all Taxes due
and payable with respect to a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. Buyer shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and timely file and cause to be timely filed all other
Tax Returns of HHI. Subject to Section 6.7(b), Buyer shall pay or cause HHI to
pay all Taxes shown to be due and payable thereon. Not less than twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the due date for filing any Tax Return, taking into
account any applicable extensions, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return
to Sellers. Sellers shall pay directly to HHI their portion of the Taxes shown
to be due on such Tax Return (determined under Section 6.7(b) hereof) within ten
(10) Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return. The
Buyer agrees that it will not, prior to the Closing Date or following its
purchase of the HHI Stock, make any transfer or take any action that would
require HHI to file a single day tax return for any of the 2003 calendar year.

         (b)      Liability for Taxes. From and after the Book Close, Sellers
shall indemnify Buyer and its affiliates (including HHI), and hold them harmless
from and against, any losses imposed on or incurred by Buyer or its affiliates
(including HHI), directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any and
all Taxes imposed upon HHI with respect to or pursuant to (i) any Pre-Closing
Period and (ii) any taxable period beginning on or before the Book Close and
ending after the Book Close (a "Straddle Period"), but only with respect to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending the day before the Book Close (such
portion, a "Pre-Closing Straddle Period"), and not for any losses or Taxes of
HHI or any Affiliate of Buyer resulting from the consummation of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. If there is a net refund received by HHI that is
reflected on a Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle
Period, the Buyer shall promptly pay, or cause HHI to pay, the amount of such
net refund to the Sellers. From and after the Book Close, Buyer shall indemnify
Sellers and hold Sellers harmless from and against all losses imposed on or
incurred by Sellers, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any
and all Taxes imposed on HHI (i) with respect to or pursuant to any taxable
period commencing on the Book Close, (ii) the portion of any Straddle Period
commencing on the Book Close and (iii) any Taxes arising or imposed on HHI
resulting from any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of
this Section 6.7, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable for the Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates
to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the day before the
Book Close and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
taxable period, and (ii) in the case of

                                       18
<PAGE>

any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period, including the
taxable year of Heritage MLP, ended on the day before the Book Close.

         (c)      Cooperation on Tax Matters.

                           (A) The Buyer, US Propane and the Sellers shall
                     cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
                     by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
                     Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation
                     or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
                     shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
                     request) the provision of records and information which are
                     reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
                     proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
                     convenient basis to provide additional information and
                     explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer, US
                     Propane and the Sellers agree (A) to retain all books and
                     records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to HHI
                     relating to any taxable period beginning before the Book
                     Close until the expiration of the statute of limitations
                     (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any extensions
                     thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
                     all record retention agreements entered into with any
                     taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party
                     reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
                     or discarding any such books and records and, if the other
                     party so requests, shall allow the other party to take
                     possession of such books and records.

                           (B) The Buyer, US Propane and the Sellers further
                     agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain
                     any certificate or other document from any Governmental
                     Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
                     mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
                     (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
                     transactions contemplated hereby).

                           (C) The Buyer agrees that it will not liquidate HHI
                     on the Book Close or Closing Date.

         (d)      Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the other Operative
Agreements (including any transfer tax imposed in any state or subdivision),
shall be paid by the Buyer when due. From time to time upon the reasonable
request of Buyer, the Sellers and US Propane shall cooperate in good faith with
the Buyer to obtain available exemptions from such Taxes. The Buyer will, at its
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, US Propane and the Sellers
will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

         6.8 AMENDMENT OF SCHEDULES. US Propane and the Sellers shall have the
continuing obligation until the Closing to amend or supplement promptly their
Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered that, if
existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be
set forth or described in their Schedules. For purposes of

                                       19
<PAGE>

determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) have been
fulfilled, the Schedules will not give effect to any amendment or supplement
thereof. If the Closing shall occur, then all matters disclosed pursuant to any
such supplement or amendment at or prior to the Closing shall be waived, and the
Schedules as so supplemented or amended at the time of Closing shall thereafter
constitute the Schedules for purposes of this Agreement.

         6.9 ACTIONS BY PARTIES. Each Party agrees to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article 7 and to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to refrain from
taking any action within its control that would cause a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

         6.10 ADDITION OF NEWLP. The Sellers covenant and agree that upon
completion of the formation and organization of NewLP the Sellers will take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to add NewLP as a party to this
Agreement. From and after such time as NewLP is so made a party, the Parties
agree that NewLP shall constitute a Seller to the same extent as if NewLP were
originally identified as a Seller herein.

         6.11 AMENDMENT OF BUYER'S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. The Sellers covenant
and agree that prior to Closing the Sellers shall cause USP GP to take such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate to amend the Buyer Partnership
Agreement to clarify that, notwithstanding the terms of Section 7.12 of the
Buyer Partnership Agreement, immediately after the closings of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and the Acquisition Agreement, the Common Units
held by HHI as of the date hereof and to be converted into Class E Units upon
the Closing which will represent the Pledged Units under the Pledge Agreement,
will continue to be treated as issued and outstanding limited partner interests,
such amendment to be in such form as shall be mutually acceptable to Sellers and
Acquirer (such form of amendment to the Buyer Partnership Agreement, the "MLP
Agreement Amendment").

         6.12 ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS. Prior to the Closing the
Sellers shall take such actions, and shall cause USP GP, US Propane and HHI to
take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to eliminate from HHI the
affiliated payables and receivables listed in Schedule 6.12.

         6.13 PRE-CLOSING DIVIDENDS OF NET WORTH NOTE AND DISTRIBUTION NOTE.

         (a)      After the Pre-Closing Restructuring is completed and prior to
the Closing, the Sellers shall cause HHI to declare a dividend of the Net Worth
Note, such dividend to be payable to NewGP and NewLP as the owners of record of
HHI on the record date established for payment of such dividend, and the payment
date of such dividend shall be the first Business Day after the Closing Date.

         (b)      After the Pre-Closing Restructuring is completed and prior to
the Closing and if the Closing occurs at any time before the receipt by HHI on
the Common Units held by HHI of the payment by the Buyer of the quarterly cash
distribution for the Buyer's quarterly period ending November 30, 2003, the
Sellers shall cause HHI to declare and pay to NewGP and NewLP, as the then
holders of record, the Distribution Note, the payment of the dividend of such
Distribution Note to be made immediately prior to the Closing. If the Closing
occurs at any time

                                       20
<PAGE>

after the receipt by HHI on the Common Units held by HHI of the payment by the
Buyer of the quarterly cash distribution for the Buyer's quarterly period ending
November 30, 2003, Sellers shall not cause HHI to pay a dividend of the
Distribution Note. The Distribution Note shall obligate HHI to pay to NewGP and
NewLP an aggregate amount (the "Pro Rated Distribution Payment") to be
calculated and paid by HHI as follows:

                  An amount equal to the excess of (i) (A) the Per Day Rate (as
         defined below) times the (ii) (B) number of calendar days in the period
         that commenced on, and includes, September 1, 2003 and ends on, but
         excludes December 1, 2003 (or, if the Closing occurs before December 1,
         2003, such date on which the Closing occurs) over (ii) the amount of
         accrued and unpaid income taxes payable, if any, by HHI in respect of
         the amount calculated in clause (i). As used herein, the term "Per Day
         Rate" means a fraction, of which (i) the numerator is equal to the
         product of (A) the quarterly cash distribution per Common Unit paid by
         Buyer to the holders of its Common Units for the quarterly period
         ending November 30, 2003 and (B) of which the denominator is 91. The
         Parties hereto agree that the foregoing calculation is intended to
         provide that the Distribution Note, if any, shall not include any
         amounts that relate to the quarterly cash distribution with respect to
         the quarterly period beginning on December 1, 2003. Buyer shall pay the
         Pro Rated Distribution Payment to the holder(s) of the Distribution
         Note within one Business Day following the payment date established by
         Buyer for such cash distribution.

contemplated hereby abandoned by written notice at any time prior to the Closing

         (a)      concurrently with any permitted termination of the

         (b)      by written consent of each of the Parties;

         (c)      by any Party if the Closing has not occurred on or before
February 15, 2004, unless such failure to close resulted from a breach of this
Agreement by the Party or its Affiliate seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(c);

         (d)      by any Party if (i) there is any statute, rule or regulation
that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the operation
of HHI's business illegal or otherwise prohibited or (ii) a Governmental
Authority (A) has issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, decree, ruling or other action

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that
has rendered impossible the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of
such other Party set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 and such violation or
breach has neither been cured within 30 days after notice by such first Party to
the other Party nor waived by the first Party; or

                                       24
<PAGE>

         (f)      by any Party, if any other event shall occur that shall render
the satisfaction of any such condition to the obligations of any other Party
(other than an Affiliate or related party of the first party) impossible and
such condition has not been waived by the other Parties.

         8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 by any Party, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made. If this Agreement is terminated for any
reason, this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement and the Acquisition Agreement
shall become void and have no effect, except that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 and in Section 6.6 and Article 10 shall survive the termination
hereof. Nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party from

         8.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties.

delivered pursuant hereto, (b) waive compliance by any other Party (other than
an Affiliate or related party of the first Party) with any of its agreements
contained herein and (c) waive fulfillment of any conditions to its obligations
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of
such Party. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

                  INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

         9.1 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE BUYER. From and after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall indemnify each of the Sellers and their respective
members, partners, Affiliates and controlling Persons (the "Seller Indemnified
Parties"), and hold the Sellers harmless from and against and in respect of any
and all Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from:

         (a)      the breach of any representation or warranty of the Buyer
contained in or made pursuant to Article 4 of this Agreement;

         (b)      the breach by the Buyer or failure of the Buyer to observe or
perform in any material respect, any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement; and

         (c)      any Taxes of HHI to the extent payable by Buyer as specified
in Section 6.7.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer will not have any obligation to
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for Losses under Section 9.1(a) unless
and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses under Section 9.1(a) exceeds
$100,000 (regardless of whether, in the case of third

                                       25
<PAGE>

party actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, the
Buyer may have a meritorious defense), at and after which time the Buyer shall
be liable, jointly and severally, for all Losses in excess of $100,000. The
immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to any obligation of Buyer under
Section 6.7. The rights and remedies of the Buyer based upon, arising out of or
otherwise in respect of any clause of this Section 9.1 or any representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact
that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of facts upon which any such
claim is based may also be the subject matter of any representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement that would not give rise to any rights or remedies of
the Sellers.

         9.2 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLERS. From and after the
Closing Date, the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the Buyer and
its partners, Affiliates and controlling Persons (the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties"), as the case may be, and hold such Persons harmless from and against
and in respect of any and all Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting
from:

         (a)      the breach of any representation or warranty of the Sellers
and US Propane contained in or made pursuant to Article 3 of this Agreement.

         (b)      the breach by any of the Sellers or US Propane or failure of
any of the Sellers or US Propane or any of their Affiliates to observe or
perform in any material respect, any of their covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement; and

         (c)      any Taxes of any of HHI to the extent payable by Sellers as
specified in Section 6.7;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Sellers or US Propane will have any
obligation to indemnify any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses under
Section 9.2(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses under
Section 9.2(a) exceeds $100,000 (regardless of whether, in the case of third
party actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, any of
the Sellers or US Propane may have a meritorious defense), at and after which
time the Sellers shall be liable, jointly and severally, for all Losses in
excess of $100,000. The immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to any
obligation of the Sellers or US Propane under Section 6.7. The rights and
remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, based upon, arising out of or
otherwise in respect of any clause of this Section 9.2 or any representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact
that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of facts upon which any such
claim is based may also be the subject matter of any representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement that would not give rise to any rights or remedies of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

         9.3 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

         (a)      Promptly after receipt by any Person entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 (an "indemnified Party") of
notice of the commencement of any Proceeding by a Person not a Party to this
Agreement in respect of which the indemnified Party will seek indemnification
hereunder (a "Third Party Action"), the indemnified Party shall notify the
Person that is obligated to provide such indemnification (an "indemnifying
Party") thereof in writing, but any failure to so notify the indemnifying Party
shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to the indemnified
Party under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, except to the extent that the
indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by the failure to give
such notice. The indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Action and to assume control of such defense with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified Party; provided, however,
that:

                  (A) the indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
         the defense of such Third Party Action and to employ counsel at its own
         expense to assist in the handling of such Third Party Action;

                  (B) the indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
         approval of the indemnified Party, which approval shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed, before entering into any settlement
         of such Third Party Action or ceasing to defend against such Third
         Party Action, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
         cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed
         against the indemnified Party or the indemnified Party would be
         adversely affected thereby;

                  (C) no indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any
         judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
         unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to
         each indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of
         such Third Party Action; and

                  (D) the indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control
         the defense of any Third Party Action unless within 15 days after
         receipt of such written notice from the indemnified Party the
         indemnifying Party confirms in writing its responsibility to indemnify
         the indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Action and
         reasonably demonstrates that it will be able to pay the full amount of
         the reasonably expected Losses in connection with any such Third Party
         Action.

         Except as set forth in the following sentence, after written notice by
the indemnifying Party to the indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of any such Third Party Action in accordance with the
foregoing and compliance by the indemnifying Party with Section 9.3(a)(iv), (A)
the indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such indemnified Party hereunder
for any Legal Expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified Party
attributable to defending against such Third Party Action, and (B) as long as
the indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting such Third Party Action in good
faith, the indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge the claim underlying, such Third Party Action
without the indemnifying Party's prior written consent. If (A) the indemnifying
Party does not assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action in

                                       27
<PAGE>

accordance with this Section 9.3 or (B) the indemnified Party has been advised
in writing by counsel that representation of such indemnified Party and the
indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct (in which case the indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action
on behalf of the indemnified Party, in each case the indemnified Party shall
have the right to defend and/or settle such Third Party Action in such manner as
it may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the indemnifying Party,
provided that (i) the indemnifying Party shall be obligated to reimburse the
indemnified Parties for the costs and expenses of only a single counsel for such
Third Party Action and any matters related thereto, and (ii) the indemnified
Party shall not settle or resolve such Third Party Action without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the indemnifying Party will
promptly reimburse the indemnified Party therefor in accordance with this
Article 9. The reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses required by this
Article 9 shall be made by periodic payments during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred.

         (b)      If the indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the
indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 9, the indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to all rights of the indemnified Party with respect to the claims to
which such indemnification relates. If an indemnified Party becomes entitled to
any indemnification from an indemnifying Party, such indemnification shall be
made in cash upon demand.

         (c)      The right of indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of each of the Parties to this
Agreement, other than with respect to fraud or willful breach by a Party. So
long as a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 is being
contested in good faith by the indemnifying Party or such claim shall otherwise
remain unliquidated, such claim shall not affect any of the rights of the
indemnifying Party under the LP Agreement, including any right to current
distributions by the LP.

         9.4 SURVIVAL. Except as provided in this Section 9.4, and except for
fraud and intentional misconduct, all representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement shall terminate as specified below.

         (a)      The right to indemnification:

                  (A) with respect to the representations and warranties
         contained in Articles 3 or 4 (other than the representations and
         warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.10, 3.13,
         3.17, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8) shall survive for 180 days
         after the Closing;

                  (B) with respect to the representations and warranties
         contained in Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.13, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 shall
         survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;

                  (C) with respect to the representations and warranties
         contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.10, 3.17, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
         and 4.7 shall survive without any time limit; and

                                       28
<PAGE>

                  (D) with respect to the covenants and agreements contained in
         this Agreement (including those covenants and agreements set forth in
         Section 6.7), shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations.

                  The expiration of any survival period under this Agreement
will not affect the liability of any Party under this Article 9 for any Loss as
to which a bona fide claim has been asserted prior to the termination of such
survival period.

         9.5 NO SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. No Party shall be entitled to
recover special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages from the other
Parties, and each Party hereby waives any claim or right to special,
consequential, exemplary or punitive damages hereunder, even if caused by the
active, passive, sole, joint, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict
liability, or other fault of any Party, other than fraud and intentional
misconduct.

         10.2 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other Operative
Agreements, together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto (where applicable,
as executed and delivered), constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

         10.3 BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFIT. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent of
each of the Parties, and any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void, provided, however, that Buyer may assign its rights, interests and
obligations under the Agreement to ___________ without the prior written consent
of the Sellers but no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of its obligations
hereunder. Except as provided in Article 9, nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
Parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

         10.4 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and such provision
shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed unenforceable, and in all
other respects this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that if any such provision may be made enforceable by limitation
thereof, then such provision shall be deemed to be so limited and shall be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

         10.5 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.

         10.6 JURISDICTION. Any legal action, suit or proceeding in law or
equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may only be instituted in any state or federal
court located in the State of Texas, and each Party agrees not to assert, by way
of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding,
any claim that is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that
its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action,
suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court. Each Party
further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such
action, suit or proceeding. Any and all service of process and any other notice
in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be effective against any Party if
given by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or by any other
means which requires a signed receipt in accordance with, and at the address
listed in, Section 10.1. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the
right of any Party to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

         10.7 FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time following the Closing, at
the request of any Party and without further consideration, the other Parties
shall execute and deliver to such requesting Party such instruments and
documents and take such other action as such requesting Party may reasonably
request or as may be otherwise necessary to (a) more fully and effectively
transfer the HHI Stock to, and vest the HHI Stock in, the Buyer, (b) enable the
Buyer to assume and fully and timely perform in accordance with their terms any
or all of the obligations of HHI, (c) enable the Buyer or their Affiliates to
receive the benefits of the ownership of the HHI Stock, and (d) otherwise
consummate more fully and effectively the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Operative Agreements.

         10.8 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings herein are inserted
for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement
and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

         10.9 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
