requirements of this Plan. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory
body having jurisdiction, which authority the Company&#146;s counsel deems necessary to the lawful

such action could have an adverse effect on this Plan or any awards granted under this Plan, and no
grantee or grantee&#146;s estate, personal representative or beneficiary shall have any claim against
the Company or any officer or director of the Company as a result of the taking of the action.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;<U>Indemnification</U>. With respect to the administration of this Plan, the Company
shall indemnify each present and future member of the Board against, and each member of the Board
shall be entitled without further action on such member&#146;s part to indemnity from the Company for,
all expenses, including the amount of judgments and the amount of approved settlements made with a
view to the curtailment of costs of litigation, other than amounts paid to the Company itself,
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or arising out of, any action, suit or
proceeding in which he or she may be involved by reason of being or having been a member of the
Board, whether or not he or she continues to be such member at the time of incurring such expenses;
provided, however, that this indemnity shall not include any expenses incurred by any such member
of the Board (i)&nbsp;in respect of matters as to which he or she shall be finally adjudged in any such
action, suit or proceeding to have been guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
performance of his or her duty as such member of the Board or (ii)&nbsp;in respect of any matter in
which any settlement is effected for an amount in excess of the amount approved by the Company on
the advice of its legal counsel; and provided further that no right of indemnification under the
provisions set forth in this Section&nbsp;16 shall be available to or enforceable by any such member of
the Board unless, within 60&nbsp;days after institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, he or
she shall have offered the Company in writing the opportunity to handle and defend same at its own
expense. The foregoing right of indemnification shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
or administrators of each such member of the Board and shall be in addition to all other rights to
which such member may be entitled as a matter of law, contract or otherwise.
