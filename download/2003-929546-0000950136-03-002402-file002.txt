       adjusting costs and investigative costs, and from and against any and all
       other such losses and expenses which the SURETY may sustain, suffer or
       incur: (i) By reason of having executed or procured the execution of

       any BOND; (v) In prosecuting or defending any action or claim in
       connection with any BOND, whether SURETY at its sole option elects to

       to make arrangements for the SURETY'S legal representation; (vi) By
       reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default by PRINCIPAL or any
       INDEMNITOR; (vii) As a result of liability incurred or amounts paid in
       satisfaction or settlement of any or all claims, demands, damages, costs,

       as soon as liability exists or is asserted against the SURETY, or upon
       the demand of SURETY, whether or not the SURETY shall have made any
       payment therefore. Such payment shall be either equal to the amount of
       any reserve set by the SURETY, or equal to such amount as the SURETY, in

       INDEMNITORS further agree that in any accounting between the SURETY and
       the PRINCIPAL, or between the SURETY and the INDEMNITORS, or either or
       both of them, the SURETY shall be entitled to reimbursement for any and
       all disbursements made by it in good faith in and about the matters
       contemplated by this Agreement under the belief that it is or was liable

       necessity, or expediency existed; and, that the vouchers or other
       evidence of any such payments made by the SURETY shall be prima facie
       evidence of the fact and amount of the liability of PRINCIPAL and
       INDEMNITORS to the SURETY. Inaddition to the payments to be made to
       SURETY as set forth above, PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS agree to pay to
       SURETY interest on all disbursements made by SURETY at the maximum rate
       permitted by law calculated from the date of each disbursement.

       and exoneration from any claim or potential claim under all BONDS and
       until SURETY has been fully reimbursed for any and all liability incurred
       from claims, demands, damages, costs, loss, expense, attorney's fees, or
       other items for which PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS are liable hereunder.

V.     REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT.
       A. In the event of any EVENT OF DEFAULT as described in this Agreement,
       SURETY shall have the right, at its option, and in its sole and absolute
       discretion, and is hereby so authorized by PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS to

       the performance required by the obligation or CONTRACT or to cause the
       same to be completed by others or to consent to the completion thereof,
       and to take any other action which SURETY may deem appropriate in
       connection therewith; (vii) in its name or in the name of the PRINCIPAL
       or INDEMNITORS to adjust, settle or compromise any claim, counterclaim,
       demand, suit or judgment involving any BOND or to take whatever other

       such matter. SURETY'S determination as to whether any such claim,
       counterclaim, demand, suit or judgment should be settled or defended
       shall be binding and conclusive upon the PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS.
       B. Any such action may be taken by SURETY with or without SURETY
       exercising any other rightor option conferred upon SURETY by law, equity
       or the terms of this Agreement, and without waiving any other right or
       option so conferred upon SURETY.
       C. At its sole option, SURETY may reduce the amount of PRINCIPAL'S and
       INDEMNITORS' liability to SURETY hereunder by applying to such liability
       any money payable to PRINCIPAL and/or INDEMNITORS by SURETY. The money
       payable to PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS may be, but is not limited to, any
       money payable by SURETY, in the event SURETY, by separate contract is an
       insurer of PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS or is an insurer of any other
       individual or legal entity, or any money payable to PRINCIPAL or
       INDEMNITORS as a return of unearned or other premiums, or money payable
       to settle a claim of PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS againstSURETY or any
       individual or other legal entity insured or bonded by SURETY. Nothing
       contained herein shall operate to enlarge any obligations of SURETY to
       PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS beyond those contained in this Agreement or in
       any such other contract of insurance.
       D. PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS agree that all amounts due SURETY hereunder,
       and all liabilities of PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS to SURETY are separate
       and independent from any actual or alleged liability of SURETY to
       PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS, and thatno set-off of any such amounts or
       claims shall be permitted to be exercised by PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS
       against SURETY nor used as a defense against any claim of SURETY. The
       PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS waive and subordinate all rights of indemnity,
       subrogation and contribution each against the other until all obligations
       to the SURETY under this Agreement, at law or in equity, have been
       satisfied in full.

VI.    PREMIUMS. The PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS will pay to the SURETY all
       premiums and charges of the SURETYfor the BONDS (including but not
       limited to initial, renewal, additional, and contract overrun premiums
       according to the SURETY'S current rate manual) immediately upon issuance
       of each BOND, or as such premiums may arise. Any billing practice, delay
       in payment or other payment variance procedure shall not constitute a
       waiver of SURETY'S rights to obtain full payment upon the issuance of any
       BOND, or as such premiums may arise. The initial premium is fully earned
       upon execution and acceptance of the BOND.

VII.   TRUST FUND.
       A. The PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS covenant and agree that all payments
       received for or on account of any CONTRACT shall be held in trust as a
       trust fund for the payment of obligations incurred or to be incurred in
       the performance of any CONTRACT and used forlabor, materials, and
       services furnished in the prosecution of the work in any CONTRACT or any
       extension or modification thereof. It is expressly understood and
       declared that all monies due and to become due under any CONTRACT are
       also trust funds, whether in the possession of the PRINCIPAL or
       INDEMNITORS or otherwise. The trust funds shall be for the benefit and
       payment of all obligations for which the SURETY may be liable under any
       BONDS. The trust(s) shall inure to the benefit of the SURETY for any
       liability or loss it may have or sustain under any BOND, and for any and
       all obligations of PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS under this Agreement, and
       this Agreement and declaration constitute notice of such trust.
       B. If SURETY discharges any such obligation, it shall be entitled to
       assert the claim of such person to the trust funds, and PRINCIPAL and
       INDEMNITORS shall, upon demand of SURETY and in implementation of the
       trust or trusts hereby created, open an account or accounts with a bank
       selected by SURETY which shall be designated as a trust account or
       accounts for the deposit of such trust funds, and shall thereupon deposit
       therein all monies received pursuant to said CONTRACT or CONTRACTS.
       Withdrawals from such accounts shall be by check or similar instrument
       signed by the PRINCIPAL and countersigned by a representative of SURETY.
       Said trust(s) shall terminate on the payment by PRINCIPAL of all the
       obligations for the payment of which the trust(s) are hereby created or
       upon the expiration of the ability to make a claim under the bond,
       whichever shall first occur.

VIII.  PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTEREST. This Agreement shall constitute a
       Security Agreement for the benefit of the SURETY and also a Financing
       Statement, both in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform
       Commercial Code or any similar statute, ordinance or regulation of any
       jurisdiction or agency, and may be so used by the SURETY without in any
       way abrogating, restricting or limiting the rights of the SURETY under
       this Agreement or under law or in equity. SURETYmay add such schedules to
       this Agreement describing specific items of security covered hereunder as
       shall be necessary or appropriate. The SURETY may, at its option, file or
       record this Agreement or any other document executed by any or all of the
       PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS in connection with the application, issuance or
       execution of any BOND(S), or renewal thereof, coming within the scope of
       this instrument as a security agreement or as part of a financing
       statement or, as notice of its prior interest and assignment under the
       provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or any other statute, ordinance
       or regulation of any jurisdiction or agency. The failure to so file shall
       not release or discharge any of the obligations of the PRINCIPAL or

       SURETY for which the PRINCIPAL and the INDEMNITORS shall be responsible,
       notwithstanding that said money or any part thereof should not be so used
       by the PRINCIPAL.

XI.    BOOKS AND RECORDS. At any time, and until such time as the liability of
       the SURETY under all BONDS is terminated or SURETY is fully reimbursed

       right of access to the books, records, accounts and documents of the
       PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS, wherever located, for the purpose of
       inspection, copying or reproduction. Any financial institution,
       depository, materialman, supply house, obligee, general PRINCIPAL,
       subcontractor, or other person, firm, or corporation, when requested by
       the SURETY, is hereby authorized by PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS to furnish
       the SURETY any information requested by SURETY, including, but not
       limited to, the status of the work under any CONTRACT being performed by
       the PRINCIPAL, the status, extent or condition of the performance of any

       condition of the performance of any other CONTRACT and payment of
       accounts. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, PRINCIPAL and

       persons, firms or entities for the purpose of procuring co-suretyship or
       reinsurance or of advising such persons, firms, or entities as it may
       deem appropriate.

XII.   DECLINE OF EXECUTION. PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS are not obligated to
       request the SURETY to execute, provide or procure any BOND required of
       them in the performance and fulfillment of obligations. Furthermore, the
       SURETY has the right in its sole and absolute discretion, to decline to
       execute, provide or procure any BOND requested by PRINCIPAL. If SURETY
       does execute, provide or procure the execution of a bid bond or proposal
       bond, or agrees or consents to provide such contract of suretyship,
       SURETY retains the right in its sole and absolute discretion to decline
       to execute the final bond (including, but not limited to, performance,
       payment or maintenance bond(s) that may berequired in connection with any
       award that may be made under the bid proposal or tender to which the bid
       proposal bond or agreement or consent to provide such contract of
       suretyship is given, without relieving PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS from
       their liability under this Agreement in connection with the provision of
       the bid bond or proposal bond. SURETY shall not be liable to PRINCIPAL or
       INDEMNITORS for any such action, and is released from any and all
       liability, cost or expense arising out of, relating to orresulting from
       any such action.

       hereby waive and agree not to assert any of the following, to the end and
       effect that PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS shall be and continue to be liable
       hereunder: (i) Any defense that this Agreement was executed subsequent to
       the date of any BOND, it being expressly understood and agreed that the
       PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS hereby admit and covenant that the BOND was
       executed by SURETY pursuant to the request of the PRINCIPAL and
       INDEMNITORS and in reliance on the promise by the PRINCIPAL and
       INDEMNITORS to execute and perform this Agreement; (ii) Any right to
       claim that any of their property, including homesteads, is exempt from
       levy, execution, sale or other legal process under the laws of any state,
       territory or possession in any action brought by SURETY under this
       Agreement; (iii) Any right to require SURETY to proceed against PRINCIPAL
       or INDEMNITORS or any other person, firm or entity or to proceed against
       orexhaust any security or remedy held by SURETY at any time or to pursue
       any other remedy in SURETY'S power; (iv) The defense of the statute of
       limitations in any action hereunder for the collection of any claim or
       amount due under this Agreement, or the performance of any obligation
       indemnified hereby; (v) Any defense based upon an election of remedies by
       SURETY, which election may destroy or otherwise impair subrogation rights
       of PRINCIPAL or any INDEMNITOR or the right of INDEMNITOR to proceed
       against thePRINCIPAL or to realize upon any security; (vi) Any right to
       notice of the execution of any BOND and of the acceptance of this
       Agreement; (vii) Any right to notice of any default, payment or any other
       act or acts giving rise to any claim under any BOND, as well as notice of
       any and all liability of the SURETY under any BOND, and any and all
       liability on the part of PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS hereunder.

XIV.   SUITS.
       A. Separate suits may be brought by SURETY against any or all of the
       PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS to enforce the terms of this Agreement as causes
       of action accrue, and the bringing of suit or the recovery of judgment
       upon any cause of action shall not prejudice or bar the bringing of other
       suits upon other causes of action, whether previously or subsequently
       arising.
       B. The PRINCIPAL and each INDEMNITOR is the agent for the PRINCIPAL and
       all INDEMNITORS for the purpose of accepting service of any process in
       the jurisdiction in which the PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS accepting the
       process resides, is domiciled, isdoing business or is found.

XV.    OTHER SURETIES. If the SURETY procures the execution of any BOND by other
       sureties, or executes the BONDS with co-sureties or reinsures any portion
       of said BONDS with reinsuring sureties, then all the terms and conditions
       of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of such other sureties,
       co-sureties and reinsuring sureties, as their interests may appear.

XVI.   TERMINATION.
       A. This Agreement is a continuing obligation of the PRINCIPAL and
       INDEMNITORS, and their successors, legal representatives, estates, heirs
       and assigns, unless terminated by written notice to SURETY as hereinafter
       provided, and such termination by a particular person or entity shall in
       no way affect the obligation of any other person or entity who has not
       given such notice. If PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS have previously executed
       an Agreement in favor of SURETY, the acceptance by SURETY of this
       Agreement shall not relieve PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS from liability to
       SURETY under such prior Agreement.
       B. This Agreement may be terminated by PRINCIPAL or any INDEMNITOR upon
       written notice to SURETY by PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS, or by PRINCIPAL'S
       or INDEMNITOR'S legal representatives or successors, by Registered or
       Certified Mail addressed to SURETY at its home office shown inthis
       Agreement, as such may be changed from time-to-time. Termination of this
       Agreement as to such person providing notice shall not be effective until
       thirty (30) days after receipt of said written notice by SURETY. It is
       understood and agreed that oral notice to or constructive notice to any
       agent or employee of SURETY shall not constitute effective notice of
       termination under this Agreement.

<PAGE>

       C. Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the PRINCIPAL or
       INDEMNITORS from liability to SURETY arising out of any BOND executed,
       authorized, provided or procured by SURETY on behalf of PRINCIPAL prior
       to the effective date of such termination and for which this Agreement is
       part of the consideration on which SURETY relied in executing,
       authorizing, providing or procuring such BONDS, including any renewals,
       substitutions and extensions thereof, and any BONDS executed pursuant to
       a bid or proposal bond executed or authorized prior to such effective
       date of termination, and any renewals, substitutions and extensions
       thereof, and any maintenance or guarantee bonds executed incidental to
       any other BOND, and any renewals, substitutions and extensions thereof.
       D. The liability of the INDEMNITORS hereunder as to existing or future
       BONDS of PRINCIPAL shall not terminate by reason of the failure of SURETY
       to disclose facts known about PRINCIPAL, even though such facts
       materially increase the risk beyond that which the INDEMNITORS might
       intend to assume. Whether SURETY may have reason to believe such facts
       are unknownto the INDEMNITORS, or whether SURETY may have reasonable
       opportunity to communicate such facts to the INDEMNITORS, the INDEMNITORS
       hereby waive notice of such facts, and of any obligation of SURETY to
       notify INDEMNITORS of same.

       to all INDEMNITORS. Any notice permitted to PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITOR may
       be sent by SURETY to their respective addresses shown in this Agreement,
       but failure of PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITOR to receive such notice shall not
       operate as a waiver of SURETY'S rights or a bar to enforcement of
       SURETY'S rights. PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS shall notify SURETY promptly
       of any change of address. Written notice must be given by PRINCIPAL or
       INDEMNITORS to SURETY at its home office, as shown in this Agreement and

       SURETY may provide to PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS from time-to-time, at the
       earliest practical time of any anticipated change or negotiations entered
       into by PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS for any anticipated change in the
       character, identity, control arrangement, management, beneficial
       ownership (including, if a corporation, ownership of more than 5% of the
       stock of PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITOR), or existence of the PRINCIPAL or

       property, documents and operations, including projects on which the
       PRINCIPAL is performing work, whether bonded or not, at any time and from
       time-to-time. The PRINCIPAL shall assure access by the SURETY'S
       representative to all areas of the PRINCIPAL'S property and operations.
       Neither the SURETY'S right to make inspections nor the making thereof,
       nor the making of any report as a result thereof, shall constitute
       anundertaking, by the SURETY or its representatives, of or for the
       benefit of the PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITORS or any other person, firm,
       organization or entity to determine, warranty or guarantee that such
       property or operations are safe, appropriate or are incompliance with any
       law, rule, regulation, or the CONTRACT; the PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS
