<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;<B>Acceptable Collateral</B>&#148; shall have the meaning given that term in the Custodial
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;<B>Affiliate</B>&#148; means, with respect to any Person, any Person directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by or under common control with such Person. As used in this definition, the term

direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148; means this Amended and Restated Master Recourse Agreement, as it may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;<B>Asset Value</B>&#148; means, with respect to each Mortgage Loan, the dollar amount equal, as
applicable, to: (a)&nbsp;the proceeds of the sale to a third party (that is not Fannie Mae, MuniMae,
Recourse Provider, or any Affiliate of Fannie Mae, MuniMae or Recourse Provider) of the applicable
Mortgaged Property at a regularly conducted foreclosure sale or at a sale directed by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy proceeding or at any other commercially reasonable sale,
which sale results in or is immediately followed by the full and indefeasible release of all of
Fannie Mae&#146;s obligations under the related Credit Enhancement Agreement (b)&nbsp;the proceeds of the
sale to a third party (that is not Fannie Mae, MuniMae, Recourse Provider, or any Affiliate of
Fannie Mae, MuniMae or Recourse Provider) of the Bonds, if any, and other obligations related to
the Mortgaged Property, which sale results in or is immediately followed by the full and
indefeasible release of all of Fannie Mae&#146;s obligations under the related Credit Enhancement
Agreement; or (c)&nbsp;the appraised value of such Mortgaged Property, as of the Release Date, agreed to
by Fannie Mae and Recourse Provider; provided, however, that if they cannot agree, the appraised
value shall be as determined by &#147;as-is&#148; appraisal(s) conducted as provided below. Fannie Mae and
Recourse Provider shall each order a separate appraisal to be completed within sixty (60)&nbsp;days of
the Release Date. Each such appraisal shall value the Mortgaged Property as of the Release Date and
shall be completed by a qualified independent fee appraiser having experience in the area where the
Mortgaged Property is located and otherwise in accordance with the requirements and procedures set
forth in the DUS Guide for appraisals required prior to delivery of a Mortgage Loan to Fannie Mae.
Any such appraisal shall be an &#147;as is&#148; appraisal, as defined and required for this purpose by the
DUS Guide. If the lower of the two appraised values differs from the higher of the two appraised
values by 5% of the higher appraised value or less, then the Asset Value will be the average of the
two appraised values. If the two appraised values differ by more than such 5%, the two appraisers
cannot agree on a value and Fannie Mae and Recourse Provider cannot agree on a value, then Fannie
Mae and Recourse Provider shall select a third appraiser, who will be engaged by Fannie Mae (and
paid from the Collateral Account), to conduct an independent appraisal within sixty (60)&nbsp;days and
value the Mortgaged Property as of the Release Date in accordance with the requirements and
procedures described in this definition. The third appraisal shall be binding upon Recourse
Provider and Fannie Mae. If Recourse Provider fails to cause an appraisal to be conducted as
provided above, the appraised value of a Mortgaged Property shall be determined exclusively by an
appraiser
