requirement that certain disputes be decided through arbitration in New York City and be governed by New York law. For the avoidance of doubt, references to a &#147;share&#148; or &#147;Share&#148; herein mean a share of the common stock of The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (&#147;GS Inc.&#148;) and, where applicable, deliveries of cash or other property in lieu thereof. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the avoidance of doubt,
I understand and agree that to be eligible to receive any award under the SIP or any predecessor plan, I must not have engaged in any conduct constituting &#147;Cause&#148; (as defined in the SIP) prior to the grant of the award, and by accepting
this Award, I represent and warrant that I have not engaged in any conduct constituting Cause. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a condition of this grant, I understand that the

otherwise as may be required under applicable law) and, as a condition to receiving such awards, I agree to be bound thereby. I also understand that the Firm may grant to me other awards under the SIP that also may contain (among other terms and
conditions) arbitration and other governing law provisions and, as a condition to receiving such awards, I agree to be bound thereby. As a condition of this grant, I agree to provide upon request an appropriate certification regarding my U.S. tax

charge with or participating in any investigation or proceeding conducted by any governmental authority, including but not limited to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I agree that all
provisions in the SIP (specifically Section&nbsp;3.17 thereof) and any applicable Award Agreements that relate to arbitration and SIP-related dispute resolution (including without limitation the provisions concerning New York choice of law and New
York City choice of forum) shall be applicable to resolution of disputes concerning Employment-Related Matters; provided, however, that Employment-Related Matters that do not relate to the SIP need not be presented to the Committee or the SIP
Committee (each, as defined in the SIP) prior to being submitted to arbitration. None of the SIP, the Award Agreement(s), or this Signature Card includes an agreement to arbitrate claims (whether they are claims relating to Employment-Related
Matters or otherwise) on a collective, class or representative basis. I explicitly agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitrator shall have the authority to consider class, collective or representative claims, to order
consolidation or to join different claimants or grant relief other than on an individual basis to the individual claimant involved and that, notwithstanding any applicable forum rules to the contrary, to the extent there is a question of
enforceability of this agreement arising from a challenge to the arbitrator&#146;s jurisdiction or to the arbitrability of a claim, it shall be decided by a court and not an arbitrator. I also understand and agree that all references to the New York
Stock Exchange in Section&nbsp;3.17 of the SIP shall be read as references to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Federal Arbitration Act governs interpretation and enforcement of all arbitration
provisions under the SIP and this Signature Card, and all arbitration proceedings thereunder. I understand and agree that nothing herein creates a substantive right to bring a claim under U.S. Federal, State, or local employment laws. To the extent
that I have entered into any prior agreement with the Firm requiring me to arbitrate certain claims, including Employment-Related Matters, I understand and agree to continue to be bound by my obligation to arbitrate all such claims, including, but
