equals the Total Commitment at such time, and (iv) shall not exceed in aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding the Maximum Swingline Amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.01(b), (x)
the Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swingline Loans at a
time when a Lender Default exists unless the Swingline Lender has entered into
arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swingline
Lender's risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender's or Lenders' participation
in such Swingline Loans, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting
Lender's or Lenders' Percentage of the outstanding Swingline Loans and (y) the
Swingline Lender shall not make any Swingline Loan after it has received written
notice from the Borrower or the Required Lenders stating that a Default or an
Event of Default exists and is continuing until such time as the Swingline
Lender shall have received written notice (I) of rescission of all such notices
from the party or parties originally delivering such notice or (II) of the
waiver of such Default or Event of Default by the Required Lenders.

         (c)      On any Business Day, the Swingline Lender may, in its sole
discretion, give notice to the Lenders that the Swingline Lender's outstanding
Swingline Loans shall be funded with one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans
(provided that such notice shall be deemed to have been automatically given upon
the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 or upon
the exercise of any of the remedies provided in the last paragraph of Section
10), in which case one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans constituting Base
Rate Loans (each such Borrowing, a "Mandatory Borrowing") shall be made on the
immediately succeeding Business Day by all Lenders pro rata based on each
Lender's Percentage (determined before giving effect to any termination of the
Commitments pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 10) and the proceeds
thereof shall be applied directly by the Swingline Lender to repay the Swingline
Lender for such outstanding Swingline Loans (although, unless a Default or an
Event of Default then exists, the Swingline Lender will not exercise such right
with respect to any outstanding Swingline Loans prior to the fourth Business Day
after the date that such Swingline Loan was made or if the Administrative Agent
has theretofore received a Notice of Borrowing the proceeds of which Borrowing
will be used to repay such outstanding Swingline Loans on or prior to the date
on which such Swingline Loans are due). Each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to
make Revolving Loans upon one Business Day's notice pursuant to each Mandatory
Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence
and on the date specified in writing by the Swingline Lender notwithstanding (i)
the amount of the Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the Minimum Borrowing
Amount otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in
Section 6 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default
then exists, (iv) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing and (v) the amount of the
Total Commitment or Borrowing Base Amount at such time. In the event that any
Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required
above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower), then each
Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date the
Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments
received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase)
from the Swingline Lender such participations in the outstanding Swingline Loans
as shall be necessary to cause the Lenders to share in such Swingline Loans
ratably based upon their respective Percentages (determined before giving effect
to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to the last paragraph of Section
10), provided that (x) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for
the account of the Swingline Lender until the date as of which the respective
participation is required to be purchased and, to the extent attributable to the
purchased participation, shall be payable to the participant from and after such
date and (y) at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to this
sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay the
Swingline Lender interest on the principal amount of the participation so
purchased for each day from and including the day upon which the Mandatory
Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for
such participation, at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days
and at the rate otherwise applicable to Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate
Loans hereunder for each day thereafter.

         1.02     Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing. The aggregate principal
amount of each Borrowing of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans shall not be
less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto. More than one
Borrowing may occur on the same date,


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
but at no time shall there be outstanding more than eight Borrowings of
Eurodollar Rate Loans in the aggregate (or such greater number as may be
acceptable to the Administrative Agent).

         1.03     Notice of Borrowing. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires to
incur Revolving Loans hereunder, it shall give the Administrative Agent at the
Notice Office at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Base Rate Loan and at least three
Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) of each Eurodollar Rate Loan to be incurred hereunder, provided that
any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only if
given before 12:00 Noon (New York time) on such day. Each such written notice or
written confirmation of telephonic notice (each, a "Notice of Borrowing"),
except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 1.10, shall be irrevocable and
shall be given by the Borrower in the form of Exhibit A, appropriately completed
to specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans to be
incurred pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which
shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether such Revolving Loans are to be incurred
as Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans, the
initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, (iv) the Borrowing Base Amount
at such time (based on the Borrowing Base Certificate last delivered or then
being delivered) and (v) the sum of (I) the aggregate principal amount of all
Loans outstanding at such time (after giving effect to the proposed Borrowing)
and (II) the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender notice of such proposed
Borrowing, of such Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the other matters
required by the immediately preceding sentence to be specified in the Notice of
Borrowing.

         (b)(i)   Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Swingline Loans
hereunder, the Borrower shall give the Swingline Lender no later than 1:00 P.M.
(New York time) on the date that a Swingline Loan is to be incurred hereunder,
written notice or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing of each
Swingline Loan to be incurred hereunder. Each such notice shall be in the form
of a Notice of Borrowing (appropriately completely) and shall be irrevocable and
specify in each case (A) the date of Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day),
(B) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans to be incurred
pursuant to such Borrowing, (C) the Borrowing Base Amount at such time (based on
the Borrowing Base Certificate last delivered or then being delivered) and (D)
the sum of (I) the aggregate principal amount of all Loans outstanding at such
time (after giving effect to the proposed Borrowing) and (II) the aggregate
amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time.

         (ii)     Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified
in Section 1.01(c), with the Borrower irrevocably agreeing, by its incurrence of
any Swingline Loan, to the making of the Mandatory Borrowings as set forth in
Section 1.01(c).

         (c)      Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to
confirm in writing any telephonic notice permitted to be given hereunder of any
Borrowing or prepayment of Loans or any revocation of any Letter of Credit
Request, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the applicable
Issuing Lender, as the case may be, may act without liability upon the basis of
telephonic notice of Borrowing, prepayment or revocation, as the case may be,
believed by the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the applicable
Issuing Lender, as the case may be, in good faith to be from the chairman of the
board, the chief executive officer,


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

the president or a Senior Financial Officer of the Borrower, or from any other
authorized officer of the Borrower designated in writing by any of the foregoing
officers of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent as being authorized to give
such notices, prior to receipt of written confirmation. In each such case, the
Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent's, the
Swingline Lender's or the applicable Issuing Lender's record of the terms of
such telephonic notice of such Borrowing or prepayment of Loans or such
revocation of a Letter of Credit Request, as the case may be, absent manifest
error.

         1.04     Disbursement of Funds. No later than 12:00 Noon (New York
time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing (or (x) in the case of
Swingline Loans, no later than 3:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date specified
pursuant to Section 1.03(b)(i) or (y) in the case of Mandatory Borrowings, no
later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date specified in Section 1.01(c),
each Lender will make available its pro rata portion (determined in accordance
with Section 1.07) of each such Borrowing requested to be made on such date (or,
in the case of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender will make available the
full amount thereof. All such amounts will be made available in Dollars and in
immediately available funds at the Payment Office, and, except for Revolving
Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing, the Administrative Agent will make
available to the Borrower at the Payment Office, the aggregate of the amounts so
made available by the Lenders to the extent of funds actually received by the
Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified
by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of any
Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date
of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to),
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the
Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender
does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Borrower shall pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent one
Business Day after the Administrative Agent's demand therefor. The
Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover on demand from such
Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding
amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made
available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower until the date such
corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per
annum equal to (i) if recovered from such Lender, at the overnight Federal Funds
Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate otherwise applicable to
such Loans for each day thereafter, and (ii) if recovered from the Borrower, the
rate of interest applicable to the respective Borrowing, as determined pursuant
to Section 1.08. Nothing in this Section 1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its obligation to make Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights
which the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any failure by
such Lender to make Loans hereunder.

         1.05     Notes. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.05(e), the
Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Loans made
by each Lender which is a party to the Existing Agreement are and shall continue
to be evidenced by the notes (each an "Existing Note" and collectively, the
"Existing Notes") executed and delivered by the Borrower


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

to such Lender pursuant to the Existing Agreement and the Loans made by any
other Lender shall be evidenced (i) if Revolving Loans, by a promissory note
duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit
B-1, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each a
"Revolving Note" and, collectively, the "Revolving Notes") and (ii) if Swingline
Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower
substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2, with blanks appropriately completed in
conformity herewith (the "Swingline Note"). The Borrower hereby reaffirms its
obligations under the Existing Notes and the parties agree that (i) the Existing
Notes shall constitute Revolving Notes and Swingline Notes, as applicable, for
all purposes hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, (ii) anything in
the Existing Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, interest thereon shall be
paid at the rates and at the times provided in Section 1.08 and (iii) the
Existing Notes shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents and secured by the Security Documents. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Borrower shall execute and deliver a Note in replacement of an
Existing Note to any Lender which requests the same.

         (b)      The Revolving Note issued to each Lender shall (i) be executed
by the Borrower (or if the Co-Borrower is formed in accordance with Section
8.04(b), by the Borrower and Co-Borrower on a joint and several basis in
accordance with Section 1.05(f)), (ii) be payable to such Lender or its
registered assigns and be dated the date of issuance, (iii) be in a stated
principal amount equal to the Commitment of such Lender (or if issued after the
termination thereof, be in a stated principal amount equal to the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loans of such Lender on the date of the
issuance thereof) and be payable in Dollars in the principal amount of Revolving
Loans evidenced thereby from time to time, (iv) mature on the Maturity Date, (v)
bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of Section 1.08 in respect
of the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans, as the case may be, evidenced
thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in Section 4.01,
and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02, and (vii) be entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and secured by the
Security Documents.

         (c)      The Swingline Note issued to the Swingline Lender shall (i) be
executed by the Borrower (or if the Co-Borrower is formed in accordance with
Section 8.04(b), by the Borrower and the Co-Borrower on a joint and several
basis in accordance with Section 1.05(f)), (ii) be payable to the order of the
Swingline Lender and be dated the date of issuance, (iii) be in a stated
principal amount equal to the Maximum Swingline Amount and be payable in Dollars
in the principal amount of Swingline Loans evidenced thereby from time to time,
(iv) mature on the Swingline Expiry Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the
appropriate clause of Section 1.09 in respect of the Base Rate Loans evidenced
thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in Section 4.01,
and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02, and (vii) be entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and secured by the
Security Documents.

         (d)      Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of
each Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any
transfer of any of its Notes endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding
principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation
or any error in such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in
respect of such Loans.


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

         (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to Lenders which at
any time (or from time to time) specifically request the delivery of such Notes.
No failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans to the
Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the Borrower to
pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) which would otherwise be evidenced
thereby in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and shall not in
any way affect the guaranty therefor provided pursuant to the Subsidiaries
Guaranty. Any Lender which does not have a Note evidencing its outstanding Loans
shall in no event be required to make the notations otherwise described in
preceding clause (d) of this Section 1.05. At any time when any Lender requests
the delivery of a Note to evidence its outstanding Loans and Commitment (if
any), the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender
the requested Note in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Loans.

         (f)      In the event that the Borrower forms the Co-Borrower in
accordance with Section 8.04(b), at such time (i) the Borrower shall cause the
Co-Borrower to execute and deliver the Joinder Agreement in the form of Exhibit
C (the "Joinder Agreement") pursuant to which the Co-Borrower shall become a
Credit Party party to this Agreement and certain of the other Credit Documents,
and (ii) the Borrower shall, and shall cause the Co-Borrower to, execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent (x) a Note in replacement of each Note then
outstanding to evidence the joint and several liability of the Borrower and the
Co-Borrower for the indebtedness evidenced thereby, and (y) all relevant
officers' certificates, resolutions, opinions of counsel and other documentation
of the type described in Sections 5.02 and 5.03 as the Co-Borrower would have
had to deliver if it were a Credit Party party to this Agreement on the
Effective Date and as otherwise may be reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent.

         1.06     Conversions. The Borrower shall have the option to convert, on
any Business Day occurring after the Effective Date, all or a portion equal to
at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount of the outstanding principal amount of
Revolving Loans made pursuant to one or more Borrowings of one or more Types of
Revolving Loans into a Borrowing of another Type of Revolving Loan, provided
that (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 1.10(b), Eurodollar Rate Loans
may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period
applicable to the Revolving Loans being converted and no such partial conversion
of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of such
Eurodollar Rate Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the
Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, (ii) unless the Required Lenders
otherwise specifically agree, Base Rate Loans may only be converted into
Eurodollar Rate Loans if no Specified Default or Event of Default is in
existence on the date of the conversion, and (iii) no conversion pursuant to
this Section 1.06 shall result in a greater number of Borrowings of Eurodollar
Rate Loans than is permitted under Section 1.02. Each such conversion shall be
effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office
prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at least three Business Days' prior notice
(each a "Notice of Conversion/Continuation"), in the form of Exhibit D,
appropriately completed to specify the Revolving Loans to be so converted, the
Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Revolving Loans were made and, if
to be converted into Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Interest Period to be initially
applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt
notice of any such proposed conversion. Swingline Loans may not be converted
pursuant to this Section 1.06.

<PAGE>

         1.07     Pro Rata Borrowings. All Borrowings of Revolving Loans made
pursuant to Section 1.01(a) shall be incurred from the Lenders pro rata on the
basis of their Commitments. All Mandatory Borrowings made pursuant to Section
1.01(c) shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their Percentages.
All Borrowings of Revolving Loans pursuant to Sections 1.06 and 1.08 shall be
made on the basis that the various Lenders will have a share of each Borrowing
which is the same percentage as a fraction the numerator of which is the
outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans of such Lender and the
denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving
Loans of all Lenders. It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for
any default by any other Lender of its obligation to make Loans hereunder and
that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it
hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to make its Loans
hereunder.

         1.08     Interest. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect
of the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan from the date of the
Borrowing thereof until the earlier of (x) the maturity thereof (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) and (y) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a
Eurodollar Rate Loan pursuant to Section 1.06, at a rate per annum which shall
be equal to the sum of the Base Rate plus the relevant Applicable Margin each as
in effect from time to time.

         (b)      The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan from the date of the Borrowing
thereof until the earlier of (x) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) and (y) the conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan to a Base Rate
Loan pursuant to Section 1.06, 1.09 or 1.10, as applicable, at a rate per annum
which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum
of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin as in
effect from time to time during such Interest Period.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, all outstanding Loans shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) the rate then borne by
such Loans and (y) the sum of the Base Rate as in effect from time to time plus
4.5%, and (ii) to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of
each Loan and any other overdue amount payable hereunder shall, in each case,
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base Rate as in effect
from time to time plus 4.5%.

         (d)      Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i)
in respect of each Base Rate Loan, quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly
Payment Date, (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar Rate Loan, on the last day of
each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period
in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month intervals after
the first day of such Interest Period, and (iii) in respect of each Loan, on any
repayment or prepayment (on the amount repaid or prepaid), at maturity (whether
by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

         (e)      Upon each Interest Determination Date, the Administrative
Agent shall determine the Eurodollar Rate for the respective Interest Period to
be applicable to Eurodollar Rate Loans and shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent manifest error,
be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

                  1.09     Interest Periods. At the time the Borrower gives any
Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in respect of the
making of, or conversion into, any Eurodollar Rate Loan (in the case of the
initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or prior to 12:00 Noon (New York
time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan (in the case of any subsequent Interest
Period), the Borrower shall have the right to elect, by giving the
Administrative Agent notice thereof, a one, two or three month interest period
or, if consented to by the Administrative Agent and otherwise available to all
of the Lenders, a period of less than one month (each an "Interest Period")
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, provided that:

                  (i)      all Eurodollar Rate Loans comprising a single
         Borrowing shall at all times have the same Interest Period;

                  (ii)     the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of
         Eurodollar Rate Loans shall commence on the date of such Borrowing
         (including the date of any conversion thereto from a Base Rate Loan)
         and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such
         Eurodollar Rate Loans shall commence on the day on which the next
         preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires;

                  (iii)    if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Rate Loan
         begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in
         the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest
         Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;

                  (iv)     if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Rate Loan
         would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such
         Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day;
         provided, however, that if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Rate
         Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is
         a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such
         month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business
         Day;

                  (v)      unless the Required Lenders otherwise specifically
         agree, no Interest Period may be selected at any time when a Specified
         Default or an Event of Default is then in existence; and

                  (vi)     no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of
         Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be selected which extends beyond the
         Maturity Date.

                  If by 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the third Business Day
preceding the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, (x) the Borrower has failed to elect a new Interest
Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans as provided above, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to continue such Eurodollar Rate Loans
as a new Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans having an Interest Period of one
month, or (y) the Borrower is not permitted to elect a new Interest Period to be
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans as provided above, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans into Base Rate
Loans. Each deemed election under this paragraph shall be effective as of the
expiration date of such current Interest Period.

                  1.10     Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event
that any Lender shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall,
absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto but, with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by the
Administrative Agent):

                  (i)      on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of
         any changes arising after the Effective Date affecting the applicable
         interbank market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining
         the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
         definition of the Eurodollar Rate; or

                  (ii)     at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased
         costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder
         with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan because of (x) any change
         arising after the Effective Date in any applicable law or governmental
         rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having
         the force of law) or in the interpretation or administration thereof by
         the NAIC or any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
         agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof and
         including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule,
         regulation, order, guideline or request, such as, for example, but not
         limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payment to any
         Lender of the principal of or interest on such Loans or any other
         amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or
         determined by reference to, the net income or profits or franchise
         taxes based on net income of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the
         country in which it is organized or in which its principal office or
         applicable lending office is located or any subdivision thereof or
         therein) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements (except to
         the extent included in the computation of the Eurodollar Rate) or any
         special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets of,
         deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender
         (or its applicable lending office) and/or (y) other circumstances since
         the Effective Date affecting the applicable interbank market or the
         position of such Lender and lenders generally in such market; or

                  (iii)    at any time after the date of this Agreement, that
         the making or continuance of any Eurodollar Rate Loan has been made (x)
         unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or order, (y)
         impossible by compliance by any Lender in good faith with any
         governmental request (whether or not having force of law) or (z)
         impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the
         Effective Date which materially and adversely affects the applicable
         interbank market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone promptly
confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and, except in the case of clause (i)
above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders).
Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall no
longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by
the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or any
Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by the Borrower with respect to such
Loans which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be
deemed rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the
Borrower shall,


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

subject to the provisions of Section 13.17 (to the extent applicable), pay to
such Lender, within 10 days of its written request therefor, such additional
amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of
calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in good faith shall reasonably
determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased
costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a written
notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable
detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such
Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all
the parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower
shall take one of the actions specified in Section 1.10(b) as promptly as
possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.

         (b)      At any time that any Eurodollar Rate Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and,
in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan affected by the circumstances described in
Section 1.10(a)(iii), shall) either (x) if the affected Eurodollar Rate Loan
then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel the respective
Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in
writing) on the same date that the Borrower was notified by the affected Lender
or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if
the affected Eurodollar Rate Loan is then outstanding, upon at least two
Business Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected
Lender in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, to convert such Eurodollar Rate
Loan into a Base Rate Loan, provided that if more than one Lender is affected at
any time as described above in this clause (b), then all affected Lenders must
be treated the same pursuant to this Section 1.10(b).

         (c)      If at any time after the Effective Date any Lender determines
that the introduction of or any change (which introduction or change shall have
occurred after the Effective Date) in any applicable law or governmental rule,
regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the
force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or
administration thereof by the NAIC or any governmental authority, central bank
or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof,
will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to
be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender based on
the existence of such Lender's Commitment hereunder or its obligations
hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to pay, subject to the provisions of Section
13.17 (to the extent applicable), to such Lender, within 10 days of its written
request therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate
such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or
such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or
such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital. In determining
such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and
will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that
such Lender's determination of compensation owing under this Section 1.10(c)
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the
parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will
be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will give prompt written notice
thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis
for calculation of such additional amounts.

         1.11 Compensation. The Borrower shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 13.17 (to the extent applicable), compensate each Lender, within 10 days
of its written request


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

(which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting
such compensation), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities
(including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by
such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Rate Loans, but excluding loss of anticipated
profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a
default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of, or
conversion from or into, Eurodollar Rate Loans does not occur on a date
specified therefor in the Notice of Borrowing, or a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation (whether or not withdrawn or deemed withdrawn pursuant
to Section 1.10(a)); (ii) if any repayment (including any repayment made
pursuant to Section 4.01 or 4.02 or as a result of an acceleration of the Loans
pursuant to Section 10) or conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a
date which is not the last day of an Interest Period or maturity date with
respect thereto, as the case may be; (iii) if any prepayment of any Eurodollar
Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by
the Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of any election made pursuant to Section
1.10(b).

         1.12     Lending Offices. Each Lender may at any time or from time to
time designate, by written notice to the Administrative Agent to the extent not
already reflected on Schedule II, one or more lending offices (which, for this
purpose, may include Affiliates of the respective Lender) for the Loans made by
such Lender hereunder; provided that, for designations made after the Effective
Date, to the extent such designation shall result in increased costs under
Section 1.10, 2.06 or 4.04 in excess of those which would be charged in the
absence of such designation of a different lending office (including a different
Affiliate of the respective Lender), then the Borrower shall not be obligated to
pay such excess increased costs (although the Borrower, in accordance with and
pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay
the costs which would apply in the absence of such designation and any
subsequent increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes
after the date of the respective designation). Each lending office and Affiliate
of any Lender designated as provided above shall, for all purposes of this
Agreement, be treated in the same manner as the respective Lender (and shall be
entitled to all indemnities and similar provisions in respect of its acting as
such hereunder). Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall affect or postpone any of
the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections
1.10, 2.06 and 4.04.

         1.13     Requested Designation of other Lending Offices. Each Lender
agrees that on the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of
Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2.06 or Section 4.04 with
respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable
efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate
another lending office for any Loans affected by such event, provided that such
designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer
no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the
consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing
in this Section 1.13 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the
Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections 1.10, 2.06 and 4.04.

         1.14     Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender or otherwise defaults in its obligations to make Loans, (y) upon the
occurrence of an event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or
(iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2.06 or Section 4.04 with respect to any Lender
which results in such Lender charging to the Borrower increased


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

costs in excess of those being generally charged by the other Lenders or (z) in
the case of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to certain proposed changes,
waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to this Agreement which have
been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided in Section
13.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right, if no Specified Default or Event of
Default then exists (or, in the case of the preceding clause (z), no Specified
Default or Event of Default will exist immediately after giving effect to such
replacement), to replace such Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with one or more
other Eligible Transferees, none of whom shall constitute a Defaulting Lender at
the time of such replacement (collectively, the "Replacement Lender"), and each
of whom shall be required to be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Agent; provided that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section
1.14, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and
Assumption Agreements pursuant to Section 13.04(b) (and with all fees payable
pursuant to said Section 13.04(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant
to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the Commitment and all outstanding
Loans of, and participations in Letters of Credit by, the Replaced Lender and,
in connection therewith, shall pay to (x) the Replaced Lender in respect thereof
an amount equal to the sum of (I) the principal of, and all accrued interest on,
all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, (II) an amount equal to all Unpaid
Drawings that have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender,
together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and
(III) all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the Replaced Lender
pursuant to Section 3.01, (y) each Issuing Lender an amount equal to such
Replaced Lender's Percentage of any Unpaid Drawing (which at such time remains
an Unpaid Drawing) to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded by such
Replaced Lender to such Issuing Lender and (z) the Swingline Lender an amount
equal to such Replaced Lender's Percentage of any Mandatory Borrowings to the
extent such amount was not theretofore funded by such Replaced Lender to the
Swingline Lender and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower due and owing to the
Replaced Lender at such time (other than those specifically described in clause
(i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is
concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective
Assignment and Assumption Agreements, the payment of amounts referred to above,
recordation of the assignment on the Register by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 13.15 and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender,
delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the
Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with
respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Sections 1.09, 1.10, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01), which shall
survive as to such Replaced Lender.

         SECTION  2. Letters of Credit.

         2.01     Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request that an Issuing Lender
issue, at any time and from time to time on and after the Effective Date and
prior to the 60th day prior to the Maturity Date, (x) for the account of the
Borrower and for the benefit of any holder (or any trustee, agent or other
similar representative for any such holders) of L/C Supportable Obligations of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, an irrevocable standby letter of
credit, in a form customarily used by such Issuing Lender or in such other form
as has been reasonably approved by such Issuing Lender and (y) for the account
of the Borrower and for the benefit of sellers of goods to the Borrower or any
of its


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, an irrevocable trade letter of credit, in a form customarily used
by such Issuing Lender or in such other form as has been reasonably approved by
such Issuing Lender (each such letter of credit issued pursuant to this Section
2.01, a "Letter of Credit"). All Letters of Credit shall be denominated in
Dollars and shall be issued on a sight basis only; it being understood, however,
that the Borrower may by written notice (including facsimile transmission) made
to the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lender as part of the
respective Letter of Credit Request, or subsequent to such Letter of Credit
Request so long as such request is made at least five Business Days' (or such
shorter period as is acceptable to such Issuing Lender) prior to the date
requested for the issuance of such Letter of Credit, require that any sight
draft drawing all or any portion of such Letter of Credit be accompanied by
additional documents or certifications, which notice shall specify a precise
description of the documents and the verbatim text of any certificates to be
presented by the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, which if presented by
such beneficiary prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit would
require the Issuing Lender to make a payment under such Letter of Credit,
although the respective Issuing Lender may, in its reasonable judgment, require
changes in any such documents and certificates to conform with changes in
customary and commercially reasonable practice or law.

         (b)      Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
each Issuing Lender agrees that it will, at any time and from time to time on
and after the Effective Date and prior to the 60th day prior to the Maturity
Date, following its receipt of the respective Letter of Credit Request, issue
for the account of the Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit as are permitted
to remain outstanding hereunder without giving rise to a Default or an Event of
Default, provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under any obligation to issue
any Letter of Credit of the types described above if at the time of such
issuance:

                  (i)      any order, judgment or decree of any governmental
         authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or
         restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit or any
         requirement of law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or
         directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
         governmental authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall
         prohibit, or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the
         issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in
         particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to
         such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement
         (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated) not in
         effect on the Effective Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense
         which was not applicable or in effect with respect to such Issuing
         Lender as of the date hereof and which such Issuing Lender reasonably
         and in good faith deems material to it; or

                  (ii)     such Issuing Lender shall have received notice from
         the Borrower or the Required Lenders prior to the issuance of such
         Letter of Credit of the type described in the second sentence of
         Section 2.03(b).

                  (iii)    Each Issuing Lender (unless the Issuing Lender is the
         Administrative Agent) agrees to provide to the Administrative Agent by
         facsimile promptly on the first Business Day of each week the daily
         aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
         Lender and outstanding during the immediately preceding week.


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

         2.02     Maximum Letter of Credit Outstandings; Final Maturities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) no
Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the
Letter of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid on
the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Letter of Credit) at
such time would exceed any of (x) $50,000,000, (y) when added to the sum of (I)
the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans then outstanding and (II)
the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans then outstanding, an
amount equal to the Borrowing Base Amount at such time (based on the Borrowing
Base Certificate last delivered or then being delivered) or (z) when added to
the sum of (I) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans then
outstanding and (II) the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans then
outstanding, an amount equal to the Total Commitment at such time, (ii) each
standby Letter of Credit shall by its terms terminate on or before the earlier
of (x) the date which occurs 12 months after the date of the issuance thereof
(although any such standby Letter of Credit may be extendible for successive
periods of up to 12 months, but not beyond the fifth Business Day prior to the
Maturity Date, on terms acceptable to such Issuing Lender) and (y) five Business
Days prior to the Maturity Date, and (iii) each trade Letter of Credit shall by
its terms terminate on or before the earlier of (x) the date which occurs 180
days after the date of the issuance thereof and (y) 15 days prior to the
Maturity Date.

         2.03     Letter of Credit Requests; Minimum Stated Amount. (a) Whenever
the Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account, the
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lender
at least five Business Days' (or such shorter period as is acceptable to such
Issuing Lender) written notice thereof (including by way of facsimile
transmission). Each notice shall be in the form of Exhibit E (each a "Letter of
Credit Request"). Each such Letter of Credit Request may be revoked
telephonically by the Borrower to the applicable Issuing Lender and the
Administrative Agent any time prior to the date of issuance of the Letter of
Credit by the applicable Issuing Lender, which revocation shall be immediately
confirmed in writing by the Borrower to such Issuing Lender and the
Administrative Agent by facsimile.

         (b)      The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to
be a representation and warranty by the Borrower that such Letter of Credit may
be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section
2.02. Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received notice from the Borrower
or the Required Lenders before it issues a Letter of Credit that one or more of
the conditions specified in Section 6 are not then satisfied, or that the
issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate Section 2.02, then such Issuing
Lender shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, issue the
requested Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower in accordance with
such Issuing Lender's usual and customary practices. Upon its issuance of or
amendment to any Letter of Credit, the respective Issuing Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in writing, of such issuance
or amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the issued Letter
of Credit or amendment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in the event that a Lender Default exists, no Issuing Lender
shall be required to issue any Letter of Credit unless such Issuing Lender has
entered into an arrangement satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate
such Issuing Lender's risk with respect to the participation in Letters of
Credit by the Defaulting Lender or Lenders, including by cash collateralizing
such Defaulting Lender's or Lenders' Percentage of the Letter of Credit
Outstandings.


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

         (c)      The initial Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall not
be less than $100,000 or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the respective
Issuing Lender.

         2.04     Letter of Credit Participations. (a) Immediately upon the
issuance by each Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender
shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender, other than such
Issuing Lender (each such Lender, in its capacity under this Section 2.04, a
"Participant"), and each such Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and
unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Lender, without
recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of
such Participant's Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each drawing or payment
made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement with
respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto. Upon
any change in the Commitments or Percentages of the Lenders pursuant to Section
1.14 or 13.04, it is hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters
of Credit and Unpaid Drawings, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the
participations pursuant to this Section 2.04 to reflect the new Percentages of
the assignor and assignee Lender, as the case may be.

         (b)      In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit
issued by it, no Issuing Lender shall have an obligation relative to the other
Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under
such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to
substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of
Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Issuing Lender under or
in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for such
Issuing Lender any resulting liability to the Borrower, any other Credit Party,
any Lender or any other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be
taken with gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

         (c)      In the event that any Issuing Lender makes any payment under
any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed
such amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(a), such
Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall
promptly notify each Participant of such failure, and, except as provided in the
proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence, each Participant shall promptly
and unconditionally pay to such Issuing Lender the amount of such Participant's
Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same day funds. If the
Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any
Business Day, any Participant required to fund a payment under a Letter of
Credit, such Participant shall make available to the respective Issuing Lender
in Dollars such Participant's Percentage of the amount of such payment on such
Business Day in same day funds; provided, however, that no Participant shall be
obligated to pay to the respective Issuing Lender its Percentage of such
unreimbursed amount for any wrongful payment made by such Issuing Lender under a
Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting
willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing Lender (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision). If and to the extent such Participant shall not have so made its
Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the respective Issuing
Lender, such Participant agrees to pay to such Issuing Lender, forthwith on
demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date
until the date such amount is paid to such Issuing Lender at the overnight
Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans for
each day thereafter. The failure of any Participant to make available to the
respective Issuing Lender its Percentage of any payment under any Letter of
Credit shall not relieve any other Participant of its obligation hereunder to
make available to such Issuing Lender its Percentage of any Letter of Credit on
the date required, as specified above, but no Participant shall be responsible
for the failure of any other Participant to make available to such Issuing
Lender such other Participant's Percentage of any such payment.

                  (d)      Whenever an Issuing Lender receives a payment of a
reimbursement obligation as to which it has received any payments from the
Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, such Issuing Lender shall pay to each
Participant which has paid its Percentage thereof, in Dollars and in same day
funds, an amount equal to such Participant's share (based upon the proportionate
aggregate amount originally funded by such Participant to the aggregate amount
funded by all Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement
obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective
participations.

                  (e)      The obligations of the Participants to make payments
to each Issuing Lender with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it shall be
irrevocable and not subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever (except
as otherwise provided in the proviso to the second sentence of Section 2.04(c))
and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of this
         Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents;

                  (ii)     the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
         right which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any
         time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee
         of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may
         be acting), the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender, any
         Participant or any other Person, whether in connection with this
         Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein
         or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction
         between the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower and the
         beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

                  (iii)    any draft, certificate or any other document
         presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv)     the surrender or impairment of any security for the
         performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit
         Documents; or

                  (v)      the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

                  2.05     Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) The
Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender, by making payment to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the
Payment Office, for any payment or disbursement made by such Issuing Lender
under any Letter of Credit issued by it (each such amount so paid until
reimbursed, an "Unpaid Drawing"), not later than one Business Day following
receipt by the


                                      -17-
<PAGE>
Borrower of notice of such payment or disbursement (provided that no such notice
shall be required to be given if a Default or an Event of Default under Section
10.05 shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Unpaid Drawing
shall be due and payable immediately without presentment, demand, protest or
notice of any kind (all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower)), with
interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender, to the
extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date of such
payment or disbursement, from and including the date paid or disbursed to but
excluding the date such Issuing Lender was reimbursed by the Borrower therefor
at a rate per annum which shall be the sum of the Applicable Margin for
Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans plus the Base Rate each
as in effect from time to time; provided, however, to the extent such amounts
are not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M (New York time) on the third Business Day
following the receipt by the Borrower of notice of such payment or disbursement
or following the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section
10.05, interest shall thereafter accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by
such Issuing Lender (and until reimbursed by the Borrower) at a rate per annum
which shall be the sum of the Base Rate as in effect from time to time plus
4.5%, in each such case, with interest to be payable on demand. Each Issuing
Lender shall give the Borrower prompt written notice of each Drawing under any
Letter of Credit issued by it, provided that the failure to give any such notice
shall in no way affect, impair or diminish the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

         (b)      The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.05 to
reimburse each Issuing Lender with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including, in
each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and
all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to
payment which the Borrower may have or have had against any Lender (including in
its capacity as issuer of the Letter of Credit or as Participant), including,
without limitation, any defense based upon the failure of any drawing or payment
under a Letter of Credit (each a "Drawing") to conform to the terms of the
Letter of Credit or any nonapplication or misapplication by the beneficiary of
the proceeds of such Drawing; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be
obligated to reimburse the respective Issuing Lender for any wrongful payment
made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of
acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the
part of such Issuing Lender (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a final and non-appealable decision).

         2.06     Increased Costs. If at any time after the Effective Date, the
introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule, regulation, order,
guideline or request or in the interpretation or administration thereof by the
NAIC or any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Issuing
Lender or any Participant with any request or directive by the NAIC or by any
such governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency (whether or not
having the force of law), shall either (i) impose, modify or make applicable any
reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against letters of
credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participated in by any Participant, or
(ii) impose on any Issuing Lender or any Participant any other conditions
relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement as it pertains to Letters of
Credit or their issuance thereof or participation therein; and the result of any
of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Issuing Lender or any
Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Issuing Lender or any


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Participant hereunder or reduce the rate of return on its capital with respect
to Letters of Credit (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or determined by
reference to, the net income or profits or franchise taxes based on net income
of such Issuing Lender or such Participant pursuant to the laws of the country
in which it is organized or in which its principal office or applicable lending
office is located or any subdivision thereof or therein), then, within 10 days
of the delivery of the certificate referred to below to the Borrower by such
Issuing Lender or such Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by
such Issuing Lender or such Participant to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall, subject to the provisions of Section 13.17 (to the extent
applicable), pay to such Issuing Lender or such Participant such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Issuing Lender or such Participant for
such increased cost or reduction in the amount receivable or reduction on the
rate of return on its capital. Each Issuing Lender or Participant, upon
determining that any additional amounts will be payable to it pursuant to this
Section 2.06, will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which
notice shall include a certificate submitted to the Borrower by such Issuing
Lender or such Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such
Issuing Lender or such Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation of such additional amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Issuing Lender or such Participant. The
certificate required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall, absent
manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

         SECTION 3.        Commitment Commission; Other Fees; Reductions of
Commitment.

         3.01     Fees. (a) For each day during the period from the Effective
Date to but excluding the Maturity Date (or such earlier date on which the Total
Commitment has been terminated) the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for distribution to each Non-Defaulting Lender a commitment commission
(the "Commitment Commission") computed at a rate per annum for each such day
equal to the then Applicable Commitment Commission Percentage on the daily
average of the Unutilized Commitment of such Lender as in effect from time to
time. Accrued Commitment Commission shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Maturity Date (or on such
earlier date on which the Total Commitment shall have been terminated).

         (b)      The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to each Lender (based on each such Lender's respective Percentage)
a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued hereunder (the "Letter of
Credit Fee") for the period from and including the date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit to and including the date of termination or expiration of such
Letter of Credit, computed at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin
then in effect for Revolving Loans maintained as Eurodollar Rate Loans on the
daily Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. Accrued Letter of Credit Fees
shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and
on the first day on or after the termination of the Total Commitment upon which
no Letters of Credit remain outstanding.

         (c)      The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for its own
account, a facing fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender hereunder (the "Facing Fee") for the period from and including the date
of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the date of the
termination or expiration of such Letter of Credit, computed at a


                                     -19-
<PAGE>

rate per annum equal to 1/8 of 1% on the daily Stated Amount of such Letter of
Credit, provided that in any event the minimum amount of the Facing Fee payable
in any 12 month period for each Letter of Credit shall be $500; it being agreed
that, on the date of issuance of any Letter of Credit and on each anniversary
thereof prior to the termination of such Letter of Credit, if $500 will exceed
the amount of Facing Fees that will accrue with respect to such Letter of Credit
for the immediately succeeding 12 month period, the full $500 shall be payable
on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and on each such anniversary
thereof. Except as otherwise provided in the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, accrued Facing Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and upon the first day on or after the
termination of the Total Commitment upon which no Letters of Credit remain
outstanding.

         (d)      The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for its own
account, upon each payment under, issuance of, or amendment to, any Letter of
Credit, such amount as shall at the time of such event be the administrative
charge and the reasonable expenses which such Issuing Lender is generally
imposing in connection with such occurrence with respect to letters of credit.

         (e)      The Borrower agrees to pay such other fees as have been agreed
to in writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

         3.02     Voluntary Termination of Unutilized Commitments. (a) Upon at
least three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent at the
Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to
each of the Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, at any time or from
time to time, without premium or penalty, to terminate the Total Unutilized
Commitment in whole, or reduce it in part, pursuant to this Section 3.02(a), in
an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in the case of partial reductions to the
Total Unutilized Commitment, provided that each such reduction shall apply
proportionately to permanently reduce the Commitment of each Lender.

         (b)      In the event of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to
this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, upon five Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders),
terminate the entire Commitment of such Lender so long as all Loans, together
with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees and all other amounts owing to such
Lender are repaid concurrently with the effectiveness of such termination
pursuant to Section 4.01(b) (at which time Schedule I shall be deemed modified
to reflect such changed amounts), and at such time, such Lender shall no longer
constitute a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement, except with respect to
indemnifications under this Agreement for periods when such Lender was a
"Lender" under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 1.10,
1.11, 4.04, 13.01 and 13.06), which shall survive as to such repaid Lender.

         3.03     Mandatory Reduction of Commitments. The Total Commitment (and
the Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate in its entirety on the earliest
of (i) the date on which a Change of Control occurs, (ii) the date upon which
the Borrower (or the Co-Borrower if


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

formed) enters into any transaction of merger or consolidation, other than any
merger or consolidation permitted by Section 9.02(a), and (iii) the Maturity
Date.

         SECTION 4.      Prepayments; Payments; Taxes.

         4.01     Voluntary Prepayments. (a) The Borrower shall have the right
to prepay the Loans without premium or penalty, in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time on the following terms and conditions: (i) the Borrower
shall give the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at the
Notice Office (x) in the case of Base Rate Loans, at least one Business Day's
prior written notice (or same day notice in the case of a prepayment of
Swingline Loans) (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its
intent to prepay such Base Rate Loans and (y) in the case of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay such Eurodollar Rate
Loans, the principal amount of such prepayment and the Types of Loans to be
prepaid and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the specific Borrowing or
Borrowings pursuant to which such Eurodollar Rate Loans were made, which notice
the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders, (ii)
each prepayment of Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000, provided that if any partial
prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans made pursuant to any Borrowing shall reduce
the outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an
amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, then such
Borrowing may not be continued as a Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans and any
election of an Interest Period with respect thereto given by the Borrower, shall
have no force or effect, (iii) each prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.01(a)
in respect of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata
among such Loans, and (iv) each prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans made
pursuant to this Section 4.01 on a day which is not the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto shall be accompanied by the payment of all amounts
owing in connection therewith pursuant to Section 1.11.

         (b)      In the event of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to
this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, upon five Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders),
repay all Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees and all other
amounts owing to such Lender under this Agreement (including under Section 1.11)
in accordance with said Section 13.12(b) so long as (A) the Commitment of such
Lender is terminated concurrently with such repayment pursuant to Section
3.02(b) (at which time Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the
changed Commitments) and (B) the consents required by Section 13.12(b) in
connection with the repayment pursuant to this Section 4.01(b) have been
obtained.

         4.02     Mandatory Repayments. (a) On any day on which the sum of (I)
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans, (II) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans and (III) the
aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings exceeds the Total
Commitment as then in effect, the Borrower shall prepay on such day the
principal of Swingline Loans and, after all Swingline Loans have been repaid in
full (or if no Swingline Loans are outstanding), Revolving Loans in an amount
equal to such excess. If,


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

after giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Swingline Loans and
Revolving Loans, the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings
exceeds the Total Commitment as then in effect, the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent at the Payment Office on such day an amount of cash and/or
Cash Equivalents equal to the amount of such excess, such cash and/or Cash
Equivalents to be held as security for all Obligations of the Borrower to each
Issuing Lender and the Lenders hereunder in a cash collateral account to be
established by the Administrative Agent.

         (b)(i)   If on any day (A) the sum of (I) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all Revolving Loans, (II) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all Swingline Loans and (III) the aggregate amount of all
Letter of Credit Outstandings exceeds the Borrowing Base Amount at such time
(based on the Borrowing Base Certificate last delivered or then being delivered)
(such excess, the "Borrowing Base Amount Deficiency") or (B) a Default exists
under Section 9.14 (such Default, a "Section 9.14 Default"), the Borrower shall,
within 10 days thereafter (or on such day to the extent required by Section
8.13), either (x) prepay outstanding Loans and/or cash collateralize outstanding
Letters of Credit in the order provided in clause (b)(ii) below in an amount
sufficient to eliminate such Borrowing Base Amount Deficiency or to cure such
Section 9.14 Default, as applicable, (y) add one or more Mortgaged Properties to
the Borrowing Base in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement
which would have the effect (i) in the case of a Borrowing Base Amount
Deficiency, of increasing the Borrowing Base Value in an aggregate amount
sufficient to eliminate such Borrowing Base Amount Deficiency or (ii) in the
case of a Section 9.14 Default, of increasing the Mortgaged Property NOI in an
amount sufficient to cure such Section 9.14 Default or (z) effect a combination
of the actions described in preceding clauses (x) and (y) so as to eliminate
such Borrowing Base Amount Deficiency or Section 9.14 Default, as applicable (it
being understood that, if any Default or Event of Default then exists (other
than, in the case of Section 4.02(b)(i)(A) the Default resulting from the
Borrowing Base Amount Deficiency in question, and in the case of Section
4.02(b)(i)(B) the Section 9.14 Default in question), the Borrower shall be
required to take the actions described in preceding clause (x)).

         (ii)     To the extent that the Borrower elects (or is required) to
prepay outstanding Loans and/or cash collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit
to eliminate any Borrowing Base Amount Deficiency or to cure any Section 9.14
Default as provided in clause (b)(i) above, the Borrower shall (1) first, prepay
principal of outstanding Swingline Loans, (2) second, after all Swingline Loans
have been repaid in full (or if no Swingline Loans are outstanding), prepay
principal of outstanding Revolving Loans and (3) third, pay to the
Administrative Agent at the Payment Office cash and/or Cash Equivalents and with
such cash and/or Cash Equivalents to be held as security for all Obligations of
the Borrower to each Issuing Lender and the Lenders hereunder in a cash
collateral account to be established by the Administrative Agent.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in
any other Credit Document, (i) all then outstanding Loans (other than Swingline
Loans) shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date, (ii) all then outstanding
Loans shall be repaid in full on the date on which (x) the Borrower (or the
Co-Borrower if formed) enters into any transaction of merger or consolidation
(other than any merger or consolidation permitted by Section 9.02(a)) or (y) a
Change of Control occurs, (iii) each Borrowing of Swingline Loans shall be
repaid in full


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

within five Business Days after the date of Borrowing thereof and (iv) all then
outstanding Swingline Loans shall be repaid in full on the Swingline Expiry
Date.

         (d)      With respect to each repayment of Loans required by Sections
4.02(a) and (b), the Borrower may designate the Types of Revolving Loans which
are to be repaid and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the specific
Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Revolving Loans were made,
provided that: (i) repayments of Eurodollar Rate Loans pursuant to this Section
4.02 may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto
unless all Eurodollar Rate Loans with Interest Periods ending on such date of
required repayment and all Base Rate Loans have been paid in full; (ii) if any
repayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans constituting a single Borrowing shall reduce
the outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans constituting such Borrowing to an amount
less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, such Borrowing shall
be converted at the end of the then current Interest Period into a Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans unless such Borrowing, together with any other Revolving Loans
maintained as Base Rate Loans (or portion thereof) or Eurodollar Rate Loans
converted or continued on the same date to Eurodollar Rate Loans with the same
Interest Period as the Interest Period to which such Borrowing is then being
continued, exceeds such Minimum Borrowing Amount; and (iii) each repayment of
any Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among
such Revolving Loans. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as
described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to
the above, make such designation in its sole discretion.

         4.03     Method and Place of Payment. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all payments under this Agreement or under any Note shall be
made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender or Lenders
entitled thereto not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date when due
and shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Payment
Office. The Administrative Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the
same day (if payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to
1:00 P.M. (New York time)) like funds relating to the payment of principal or
interest ratably to the Lenders entitled thereto. Any payments under this
Agreement or under any Note which are made later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time)
on any day shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business
Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under any Note shall be stated
to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of
principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable rate during such
extension.

         4.04     Net Payments. (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder
of under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense.
Except as provided in Section 4.04(b), all such payments will be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature
now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but
excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed
on or measured by the net income or net profits or franchise taxes based on net
income of a Lender pursuant to the laws of the country in which it is organized
or the country in which the principal office or applicable lending office of
such Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest,
penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts,


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as
"Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees, subject to
Section 13.17 (to the extent applicable), to pay the full amount of such Taxes,
and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all
amounts due under this Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or
deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount
provided for herein or in such Note. If any amounts are payable in respect of
Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Borrower hereby agrees to
reimburse each Lender, within 10 days of the written request of such Lender, for
taxes imposed on or measured by the net income and net profits and franchise
taxes imposed on net income of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the country
in which it is organized or the country in which the principal office or
applicable lending office of such Lender is located or under the laws of any
political subdivision or taxing authority of any such country in which it is
organized or the country in which the principal office or applicable lending
office of such Lender is located and for any withholding of taxes as such Lender
shall determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Lender in respect of such
amounts so paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding
sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Lender
pursuant to this sentence. If the Borrower pays any additional amount under this
Section 4.04 to a Lender and such Lender determines in its sole discretion that
it has actually received or realized in connection therewith any refund or any
reduction of, or credit against, its Tax liabilities in or with respect to the
taxable year in which the additional amount is paid (a "Tax Benefit"), such
Lender shall pay to the Borrower an amount that the Lender shall, in its sole
discretion, determine is equal to the net benefit, after tax, which was obtained
by such Lender in such year as a consequence of such Tax Benefit; provided,
however, that (i) any Lender may determine, in its sole discretion consistent
with the policies of such Lender, whether to seek a Tax Benefit; (ii) any Taxes
that are imposed on a Lender as a result of a disallowance or reduction
(including through the expiration of any tax credit carryover or carryback of
such Lender that otherwise would not have expired) of any Tax Benefit with
respect to which such Lender has made a payment to the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 4.04(a) shall be treated as a Tax for which the Borrower is obligated to
indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 4.04 without any exclusions or
defenses; and (iii) nothing in this Section 4.04(a) shall require any Lender to
disclose any confidential information to the Borrower (including, without
limitation, such Lender's tax returns). The Borrower will furnish to the
Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date the payment of any Taxes is
due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such
payment by the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Lender, and reimburse such Lender within 10 days of its written request, for the
amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

         (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Effective Date, or in the case
of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this
Agreement pursuant to Section 1.14, 1.15 or 13.04 (unless the respective Lender
was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or
transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) two
accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax
treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender's entitlement as of such
date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to
payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if the
Lender is not a


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

"bank" (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code) and cannot
deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect
to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or successor forms)
pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit F (any such certificate, a "Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y)
two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) (or successor
form) certifying to such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from
United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made by
the Borrower under this Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender
agrees that from time to time after the Effective Date, whenever a lapse in time
or change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or
inaccurate in any material respect, it will deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete original signed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits
of any income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio
interest exemption) and a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be,
and such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the
entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United
States withholding tax with respect to payments by the Borrower under this
Agreement and any Note, or it shall immediately notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate in
which case such Lender shall not be required to deliver any such Form or
Certificate pursuant to this Section 4.04(b). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 4.04(a), but subject to Section 13.04(b) and the
immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the
extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar
taxes imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts payable
hereunder for the account of any Lender which is not a United States person (as
such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income
tax purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the Borrower
U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from
such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated
pursuant to Section 4.04(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender
in respect of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such
Lender has not provided to the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms
required to be provided to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) or (II)
in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in clause
(ii) above, to the extent that such forms do not establish a complete exemption
from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 4.04 and except
as set forth in Section 13.04(b), the Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts
and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 4.04(a) (without
regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or
withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described
in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes that are
effective after the Effective Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental
rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating
to the deducting or withholding of income or similar Taxes (but, in the case of
any amount withheld or deducted by the government of the United States or a
political subdivision thereof, only if such Lender has provided the Borrower the
appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable, a Section
4.04(b)(ii) Certificate) required to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4.04(b), if entitled to a reduced rate of withholding
or deduction, and in such event, the payment (whether as an additional


                                      -25-
<PAGE>
amount or under the indemnity) shall only be for the amount in excess of such
reduced rate of withholding or deduction).

         SECTION  5. Conditions Precedent to the Effective Date. The occurrence
of the Effective Date pursuant to Section 13.10 is subject to the satisfaction
of the following conditions:

         5.01     Execution of Agreement. On or prior to the Effective Date,

following conditions:

         6.01     Effective Date. The Effective Date shall have occurred.

         6.02     No Default; Representations and Warranties. At the time of
each such Credit Event and also after giving effect thereto, (i) there shall
exist no Default or Event of Default and (ii) all representations and warranties
contained herein and in the other Credit Documents shall be true and correct in
all material respects with the same effect as though such representations and
warranties had been made on such date (it being understood and agreed that any
representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified date
shall be required to be true and correct in all material respects only as of
such specified date).

         6.03     Notice of Borrowing; Letter of Credit Request. (a) Prior to
the making of each Revolving Loan (other than a Revolving Loan made pursuant to
a Mandatory Borrowing), the Administrative Agent shall have received a Notice of

each Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender shall have received the notice

         (b)      Prior to the issuance of each Letter of Credit, the
Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lender shall have received a
Letter of Credit Request meeting the requirements of Section 2.03.

                  The acceptance of the benefits of each Credit Event shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent and each of the Lenders that all conditions specified in this Section 6
exist as of that time.

         SECTION  7. Representations, Warranties and Agreements. In order to
induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans, and issue
(or participate in) the Letters of Credit as provided herein, the Borrower makes
the following representations, warranties and agreements, all of which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans
and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, with the occurrence of the Effective
Date and each Credit Event on or after the Effective Date deemed to constitute a
representation and warranty that the matters specified in this Section 7 are
true and correct in all material respects on the Effective Date and on the date
of each such Credit Event (it being understood and agreed that any
representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

a specified date shall be required to be true and correct in all material
respects only as of such specified date).

Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized and validly existing Company in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has the
requisite Company power and authority to own its property and assets and to
transact the business in which it is engaged and presently proposes to engage

property or the conduct of its business requires such qualifications, except for
failures to be so qualified and, in the case of Persons other than a Credit
Party, for failures to be so organized, existing or in good standing, which,
either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.02     Company Power and Authority. Each Credit Party has the
requisite Company power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the terms
and provisions of each of the Credit Documents to which it is party and has
taken all necessary Company action to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by it of each of such Credit Documents. Each Credit Party has duly
executed and delivered each of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and
each of such Credit Documents constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws generally affecting creditors'
rights and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought
in equity or at law).

         7.03     No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or performance
by any Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, nor the
occurrence of any Credit Event, nor compliance by such Credit Party with the
terms and provisions relating thereto, (i) will contravene any provision of any
Applicable Laws or Property Agreements, (ii) will conflict with or result in any
breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the
obligation to create or impose) any Lien upon any of the property or assets of
such Credit Party pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of
trust, credit agreement or loan agreement (other than the Security Documents),
or any other material agreement, contract or instrument, to which such Credit
Party is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets is bound or to
which it may be subject or (iii) will violate any provision of the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws (or other organizational documents) of such Credit
Party.

         7.04     Governmental Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license,
authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with
(except (x) as have been obtained or made on or prior to the Effective Date or
(y) in the case of any Person which becomes a Credit Party after the Effective
Date, as have been obtained or made on or prior to the date on which such Person
became a Credit Party), or exemption by, any governmental or public body or
authority, or any subdivision thereof, is required to authorize, or is required
in connection with, (i) the execution, delivery and performance of any Credit
Document or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
such Credit Document.

         7.05     Financial Statements; Financial Condition; Undisclosed
Liabilities; Projections, etc. (a) The consolidated balance sheets of the
Borrower for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2001 and for the nine-month
period ended on September 30, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows and shareholders' equity of the Borrower for the fiscal year
or nine-month period ended on such dates, as the case may be, copies of which
have been furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders prior to the
Effective Date, present fairly in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Borrower at the date of such balance sheets and the
consolidated results of the operations of the Borrower for the periods covered
thereby. All of the foregoing historical financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP. Since September 30, 2002, there has been no change in
the business, operations, property, assets, liabilities or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b)      On and as of the Effective Date, after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and to all Indebtedness (including
the Loans and the Subsidiaries Guaranty) being incurred or assumed by any Credit
Party, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and of the Borrower on a stand-alone basis will
exceed their respective debts; (b) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole and the Borrower on a stand-alone basis have (or has) not incurred and do
not intend to incur, and do not believe that they will incur, debts beyond their
ability to pay such debts as such debts mature; and (c) the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and the Borrower on a stand-alone basis will have
sufficient capital with which to conduct their respective businesses. For
purposes of this Section 7.05(b), "debt" means any liability on a claim, and
"claim" means (i) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured or (ii) right to
an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a
payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to
judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured
or unsecured.

         (c)      Except (i) as disclosed in the financial statements referred
to in Section 7.05(a), (ii) for liabilities arising in the ordinary course of
business since September 30, 2002 and (iii) any liabilities under this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents, there were as of the Effective Date no
liabilities or obligations with respect to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the
Effective Date, the Borrower does not know of any basis for the assertion
against it or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation of any
nature whatsoever that is not disclosed in the financial statements referred to
in Section 7.05(a) which, either individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (d)      On and as of the Effective Date, the Projections previously
delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders were prepared in good
faith based upon reasonable assumptions by management of the Borrower and
reflect the Borrower's actual expectations for its operations and performance
for the periods covered by the Projections. On the Effective Date, the Borrower
believed that the Projections were reasonable and attainable.


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

         7.06     Litigation. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings
(including, without limitation, any Environment Claims) pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened (i) with respect to any Credit Document or
the transactions contemplated thereby or (ii) that individually or in the
aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) There are no final nonappealable judgments or decrees in an
aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or more entered by a court or courts of
competent jurisdiction against any Credit Party (other than any judgment as to
which, and only to the extent, a reputable and solvent insurance company has
acknowledged coverage of such claim in writing or which have been paid).

         7.07     True and Complete Disclosure. All factual information (taken
as a whole) furnished by any Credit Party in writing to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender (including, without limitation, all information contained in the
Credit Documents and the Property Information with respect to each Mortgaged
Property) for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement, the other Credit
Documents or any transaction contemplated herein or therein is, and all other
such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf
of any Credit Party in writing to the Administrative Agent or any Lender will
be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such
information is dated or certified and not incomplete by knowingly omitting to
state any fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole) not
misleading in any material respect at such time in light of the circumstances
under which such information was provided.

         7.08     Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. (a) All proceeds of the
Loans will be used for the general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, making Investments and paying
Dividends as, and to the extent, permitted by this Agreement); provided,
however, proceeds of Swingline Loans may not be used to repay any then
outstanding Swingline Loans.

         (b) Neither the making of any Loan nor the use of the proceeds thereof
nor the occurrence of any other Credit Event will violate or be inconsistent
with the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System. At the time of each Credit Event occurring on or after
the Effective Date, not more than 25% of the value of either (x) the Restricted
Property taken as a whole or (y) the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole will constitute Margin Stock.

         7.09     Tax Returns and Payments. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be timely filed with the appropriate
taxing authority, all Federal and all material state, local, foreign and other
returns, statements, forms and reports for taxes (the "Returns") required to be
filed by or with respect to the income, properties or operations of the Borrower
and/or any of its Subsidiaries. The Returns accurately reflect all liability for
taxes of each Credit Party and each of its Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby except for any such taxes that, either individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries have paid all material taxes payable by them other
than taxes contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been
established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There
is no


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit, or claim now pending or,
to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by any authority regarding any
taxes relating to any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries which, either
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effective.

         7.10     Subsidiaries. Schedule 7.10 sets forth, as of the Effective
Date, (a) on Part A thereof, each Subsidiary (other than an immaterial
Subsidiary) of the Borrower (showing the direct and indirect ownership interests
therein), and (b) on Part B thereof, each Subsidiary Guarantor (showing the
direct and indirect ownership interests therein and the Mortgaged Properties
owned by such Subsidiary Guarantor).

         7.11     Compliance with Applicable Laws. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Applicable Laws in respect of the conduct
of its business and the ownership of its property (including, without
limitation, all building and zoning ordinances and codes), except such
noncompliances as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.12     Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary thereof is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.

         7.13     Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary thereof is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         7.14     Status as a REIT. The Borrower is organized in conformity with
the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust under the
Code. The Borrower will meet all of the requirements for qualification as a real
estate investment trust under the Code for its taxable year ending December 31,
2002 and will elect to be treated as such for such taxable year. The Borrower is
or will be in a position to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the
Code for each taxable year thereafter and its proposed methods of operation will
enable it to so qualify.

         7.15     Compliance with ERISA. (a) Except as could not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect: each Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract or fund)
is in substantial compliance with its terms and with all applicable laws,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code; each Plan (and each related
trust, if any) which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to
the effect that it meets the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the
Code; no Reportable Event has occurred; no Multiemployer Plan is insolvent or in
reorganization; no Plan is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or
Title IV of ERISA; all contributions required to be made with respect to a Plan
or a Multiemployer Plan have been timely made; no member of the ERISA Group has
incurred any liability (including any indirect, contingent or secondary
liability) to or on account of a Plan or Multiemployer Plan pursuant to Section
409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4069, 4201, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA or
Section 401(a)(29), 4971 or 4975 of the Code or, to the knowledge of


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

the Borrower, expects to incur any such liability under any of the foregoing
sections with respect to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan; no condition exists
which presents a material risk to any member of the ERISA Group of incurring a
liability to or on account of a Plan or Multiemployer Plan pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code; no action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, audit or investigation with respect to the administration, operation or
the investment of assets of any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is
pending, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, is expected or threatened; using
actuarial assumptions and computation methods consistent with Part 1 of subtitle
E of Title IV of ERISA, the aggregate liabilities of the ERISA Group to all
Multiemployer Plans in the event of a complete withdrawal therefrom, as of the
close of the most recent fiscal year of each such Multiemployer Plan ended prior
to the date of the most recent Credit Event, would not result in a liability;
each group health plan (as defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA or Section
4980B(g)(2) of the Code) which covers or has covered employees or former
employees of any member of the ERISA Group has at all times been operated in
compliance with the provisions of Part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code; no lien imposed under the Code or ERISA on the assets
of any member of the ERISA Group exists or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, is
likely to arise on account of any Plan or Multiemployer Plan; and no member of
the ERISA Group maintains or contributes to any employee welfare benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which provides benefits to retired
employees or other former employees (other than as required by Section 601 of
ERISA) or any Plan the obligations with respect to which could reasonably be
expected to be material.

         (b) Except as could not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: each Foreign Pension
Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the
requirements of any and all applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and
orders and has been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities; all contributions required to be made with respect to a
Foreign Pension Plan have been timely made; no member of the ERISA Group has
incurred any obligation in connection with the termination of, or withdrawal
from, any Foreign Pension Plan; and the present value of the accrued benefit
liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign Pension Plan, determined
as of the end of the Borrower's most recently ended fiscal year on the basis of
actuarial assumptions, each of which is reasonable, did not exceed the current
value of the assets of such Foreign Pension Plan allocable to such benefit
liabilities or, alternatively, each of the Credit Parties has established
adequate reserves for the present value of such accrued benefit liabilities,
determined as described herein, in the financial statements referred to in
Section 7.05(a) hereof.

         7.16     Environmental Compliance. (a) (i) There are in effect all
Environmental Approvals which are required to be obtained under all

(ii) the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms
and conditions of all such Environmental Approvals, and is also in compliance
with all other Environmental Laws or any order, decree, judgment or injunction
issued, entered or approved thereunder, except to the extent failure to comply,
either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (b) (i) there are no Environmental Claims pending or threatened by any

Subsidiaries, or with respect to any generation, treatment, storage, recycling,
transportation, Release or disposal of any Hazardous Material generated by the

Environmental Claims, either individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (ii)     no Hazardous Material has been Released by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries at any property owned, leased or operated (currently or in
the past) by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case to the extent

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (iii)    no friable asbestos is present at any of the properties owned,

         (v)      there are no other facts, circumstances or conditions relating
to environmental matters of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their
operations or their currently owned, leased or operated properties which, either

Subsidiaries has obtained and holds in full force and effect all patents,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other such rights, free
from burdensome restrictions, which are necessary for the operation of its
business as presently conducted, the absence or impairment of which, either
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         7.18     No Default. No Default or Event of Default is in existence.
Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in any material
respect beyond any applicable grace period under or with respect to any other
material agreement, instrument or undertaking to which it is a party or by which

obtained and holds in full force and effect, all franchises, licenses, permits,
certificates, authorizations, qualifications, accreditations, easements, rights

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to,
its capital stock, except for options, warrants and rights to purchase shares
held by the Borrower or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower or, in the
case of any Subsidiary Guarantor which is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary or may

other Person so long as the Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties owned by
such Subsidiary Guarantor would not fail to satisfy all of the Mortgaged


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

Property Conditions if the Borrower or such Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the
Borrower and such Person fully exercised such options, warrants and rights to
purchase shares.

         7.24     Mortgaged Properties. (a) There are no outstanding options,
rights of first refusal, rights of first offer or similar rights to purchase or
otherwise acquire any Mortgaged Property Owner's interest in any Mortgaged
Property. Each Mortgaged Property Owner has good and marketable fee simple title
to and/or a valid ground leasehold interest in each of its Mortgaged Properties
and good title to the remainder of the Collateral purported to be owned or
leased by it free and clear of all Liens, in each case except Permitted
Encumbrances. All material fixtures, furnishings, attachments and equipment
necessary for the operation, use and occupancy of each Mortgaged Property have
been installed or incorporated into such Mortgaged Property and a Mortgaged
Property Owner is the sole owner or lessee of all of the same, free and clear of
all chattel mortgages, conditional vendor's liens and other Liens and security
interests other than Permitted Encumbrances. No tax Liens have been filed
against any Mortgaged Property Owner and/or any of the Mortgaged Properties,
other than Liens for non-delinquent real property taxes.

         (b) The provisions of the Security Documents are effective to create,
perfect and maintain, upon proper filing or recording or taking of possession,
as applicable, in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders, valid and legally enforceable Liens on all of the Mortgaged Properties
and other Collateral purported to be encumbered thereby and, when all necessary
recordings and filings have been effected in all necessary public offices, and
payment is made of any applicable mortgage recording, intangible and/or similar
taxes, the Security Documents will constitute perfected Liens on all of such
Mortgaged Properties and all of the other Collateral prior and superior to all
other Liens except Permitted Encumbrances. Each Mortgage upon execution and
delivery by a Subsidiary Guarantor will be a valid and enforceable first
priority Lien on the Mortgaged Property that such Mortgage purports to encumber,
except for Permitted Encumbrances, and such Mortgage, when recorded in the
property records of the county in which such Mortgaged Property is located and
upon payment of any applicable mortgage recording, intangible and/or similar
taxes, will be a valid and enforceable first priority Lien on such Mortgaged
Property in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders,
which Mortgaged Property will then be free and clear of all Liens having
priority over the first Lien of such Mortgage, except for Permitted
Encumbrances. Each Assignment of Rents and Leases upon execution and delivery by
a Subsidiary Guarantor and recordation of such Assignment of Rents and Leases in
the property records of the county in which the Mortgaged Property affected by
such Assignment of Rents and Leases is located and upon payment of any
applicable recording or intangible taxes, will be a valid and enforceable first
priority present assignment of or Lien on all Leases affecting such Mortgaged
Property and of all Rents of and from such Mortgaged Property and of all
security for such Leases (including, without limitation, cash or securities
deposited as security under such Leases subject to the prior right of the
Tenants making such deposits), free and clear of all Liens having priority over
such Assignment of Rents and Leases, except for Permitted Encumbrances. No
mechanic's liens have been filed and remain in effect against any Mortgaged
Property, except as specifically disclosed and insured against in the Title
Policy for such Mortgaged Policy. All filings (including all financing
statements under the UCC) have been delivered to the Administrative Agent for
filing in the public office in which such filings are required or advisable to
perfect the Liens on each of the Mortgaged Properties and the other Collateral
granted pursuant to the Security Documents and,


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

except for the filing of continuation statements with respect to such financing
statements as may be required to be filed at periodic intervals, no periodic
refiling or periodic recording is presently required to protect and preserve
such Liens.

         (c) The use and operation of each Mortgaged Property as office,
industrial or flex building(s) with related uses, separate and apart from any
other properties, constitutes a legal use under applicable zoning regulations
and complies in all material respects with all Applicable Laws, Property
Agreements and Insurance Requirements and does not violate any Authorizations to
which the Mortgaged Property Owner thereof is a party or by which such Mortgaged
Property Owner or Mortgaged Property is bound, except for violations and
failures to comply which could not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the zoning
nor any right of access to adjacent public streets or use of any Mortgaged
Property is to any material extent dependent upon or related to any property
other than such Mortgaged Property.

         (d) There have been issued in respect of each Mortgaged Property all
Authorizations necessary to own, operate, use and occupy such Mortgaged Property
in the manner operated by the relevant Mortgaged Property Owner (including any
required permits relating to Hazardous Materials) other than any such
Authorizations which, if not issued, could not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Borrower nor any Mortgaged Property Owner nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
any prior owner thereof has received any notice of violation or revocation of
such Authorizations except for those which, either individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         (e) Except as otherwise disclosed in the Engineering Reports, (i) each
Mortgaged Property is free of material structural defects and is in good repair
(normal wear and tear excepted) and all building systems and other items of
Collateral therein are in good working order in all material respects (normal
wear and tear excepted) and (ii) each Mortgaged Property is free and clear of
any damage that would affect materially and adversely the value of such
Mortgaged Property or the use of such Mortgaged Property for its intended
purposes. To the knowledge of the Borrower, except as otherwise disclosed in the
Title Policies and Surveys, no improvement at any Mortgaged Property encroaches
upon any building line, setback line, side yard line or any recorded or visible
easement.

         (f) No condemnation or other like proceedings (including relocation of
any roadways abutting any Mortgaged Property or change in grade of such roadways
or denial of access to any Mortgaged Property) that has had or could reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, are pending nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against
any Mortgaged Property in any manner whatsoever. No casualty has occurred to any
Mortgaged Property that has had or could reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         (g) To the extent necessary for the full utilization of each Mortgaged
Property in accordance with its current use, telephone services, gas, steam,
electric power, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and water facilities and all other
utility services are available to such Mortgaged


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

Property, are adequate to serve such Mortgaged Property, exist at the boundaries
of such Mortgaged Property and are not subject to any conditions, other than
normal charges to the utility supplier, which would limit the use of such
utilities. All streets and easements necessary for access to and the occupancy
and operation of each Mortgaged Property are available at the boundaries of such
Mortgaged Property. All necessary rights-of-way for all roads, which are
sufficient to permit each Mortgaged Property to be utilized fully for its
current use, have been completed and are serviceable, and, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, all public rights-of-way through or adjacent to each Mortgaged
Property have been acquired and dedicated and accepted for maintenance and
public use by the applicable Governmental Authorities.

         (h) Except as otherwise disclosed in the Environmental Reports, none of
the improvements on any Mortgaged Property are constructed on land designated by
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction as wetlands.

         (i) Each Mortgaged Property is comprised of one or more parcels, each
of which, to the knowledge of the Borrower, constitutes a separate tax lot and
none of which constitutes a portion of any other tax lot.

         (j) Each of the Material Leases with respect to each Mortgaged Property
is in full force and effect and no Person has failed in any respect to perform
any obligation or covenant or satisfy any condition required by any of such
Material Leases to be performed or complied with, except where failure to so
perform or comply has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. No
litigation is currently pending or has been threatened by any Person in
connection with any of the Material Leases that has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (k) The leasing, maintenance and operation of each of the Mortgaged
Properties is managed by the Borrower, the Co-Borrower if formed or a
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower or the Co-Borrower. All of such
management rights are subject and subordinate to the Security Documents.

documents (financial or otherwise and including, without limitation, rent rolls
and other property specific information for the Mortgaged Properties (including,
without limitation, property specific information for determining the Mortgaged
Property NOI) and outstanding Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries)
with respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or properties owned by

information could not result in a violation of, or expose the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries to any material liability under, any Applicable Laws or any

its Subsidiaries to any material liability under, any Applicable Laws, or any
agreements with


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

unaffiliated third parties that are binding on the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or on any property of any of them, to examine the books of account
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and discuss the affairs, finances and
accounts of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with its officers and independent
accountants, all at such reasonable times and intervals and to such reasonable
extent as the Administrative Agent or such Lender may reasonably request. Any
Lender requesting any such visit, inspection, examination or discussion shall
coordinate same with the Administrative Agent.

         (b) At a date to be mutually agreed upon between the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower, the Borrower will, at the request of the Administrative
Agent, hold an annual meeting with all of the Lenders, at which meeting will be
reviewed the financial results of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the
previous fiscal year and the budgets presented for the current fiscal year of
the Borrower.

         8.03     Maintenance of Property; Insurance; Casualty and Condemnation;

casualty, condemnation, restoration and renovation requirements with respect to
the Mortgaged Properties, are incorporated by reference herein.

         (d) To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby
irrevocably waives, releases and discharges any and all rights of action,
demands and other claims of any kind or nature against the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders arising from any failure of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders to comply with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C.
ss.ss. 4001, et seq.), the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 or the National
Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, including any failure of the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders to provide the Borrower with written notification whether

disaster relief assistance will be available in the event of flood damage to any
Mortgaged Property.

         8.04     Conduct of Business; Co-Borrower; Subsidiary Guarantors. (a)
The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, ensure that the

         (b) In the event that the Borrower elects to conduct its business
(including, without limitation, its ownership of all of the Equity Interests in
Holdings, TRE and any Subsidiary Guarantor described in Section 8.13(f)) by
means of an operating "upreit" entity, such entity (the "Co-Borrower") shall be
a limited partnership or a limited liability company in which (i) the Borrower
or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower shall be at all times the sole
general partner or managing member, as applicable, and (ii) the Borrower and/or
such Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower shall at all times own not less
than 80% of the Equity Interests of the Co-Borrower and control all financing,
sale and other material decisions relating to the Co-Borrower with no veto
rights in any minority equity owner therein or any other Person. At the time of
formation of the Co-Borrower, the Borrower shall, and shall cause the
Co-Borrower to, comply with the provisions of Section 1.05(f) so that the
Co-Borrower shall be a Credit Party party to this Agreement and certain of the
other Credit Documents.

         8.05     Compliance with Applicable Laws and Authorizations. The
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all
Applicable Laws (including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, all zoning

Authorizations except where non-compliance, either individually or in the
aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done, all things
necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its Company existence
and its rights, franchises, licenses and patents; provided, however, that (i)
nothing in this Section 8.06 shall require any Subsidiary of the Borrower which
is not a Credit Party to preserve and keep in full force and effect its Company
existence where any such event, either individually or in the aggregate, could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Default or an Event of Default or
where any such event, either individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) nothing in this
Section 8.06 shall prevent the withdrawal by the Borrower or any Subsidiary
thereof of its qualification as a foreign Company in any jurisdiction where such
withdrawal, either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to maintain any such right,
franchise, license or patent in the event the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
the case may be, has determined in its reasonable business judgment, that the
maintenance of such right, franchise, license or patent is no longer necessary
or desirable in the conduct of its business.

         8.07     Performance of Obligations. The Borrower will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, perform all of its obligations under the terms of
each material agreement, contract or instrument (other than any such material
agreement, contract or instrument governing Indebtedness) by which it is bound,
except such non-performances as could not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         8.08     Payment of Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, pay and discharge, or cause to be paid and discharged, all
taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon
its income or profits, or upon the Mortgaged Properties and any other properties
belonging to it, in each case on a timely basis, and all lawful claims which, if
unpaid, might become a Lien upon any properties of the Borrower or


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

such Subsidiary; provided that neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof
will be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim which
(x) is being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings if it has
maintained adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP or (y)
either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect and so long as no Default or Event of Default
under Section 9.01 shall occur as a result thereof.

         8.09     Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will use all proceeds from each
Credit Event only as provided in Section 7.08.

         8.10     End of Fiscal Years; Fiscal Quarters. The Borrower will, for
financial reporting purposes, cause (i) each of its fiscal years and fourth

three fiscal quarters to end on the last day of March, June and September of
each year.

         8.11     Interest Rate Protection. The Borrower will, and/or will cause
its respective Subsidiaries which are the primary obligors on the respective
Indebtedness to, maintain Interest Rate Hedges on a notional amount of
Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than
Intercompany Indebtedness) which, when added to the aggregate principal amount
of Indebtedness for borrowed money of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other
than Intercompany Indebtedness) which bears interest at a fixed rate, equals or
exceeds 60% of the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness for borrowed
money of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Intercompany
Indebtedness).

         8.12     REIT Requirements. The Borrower will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, operate its business at all times so as to satisfy all
requirements necessary to qualify and maintain the Borrower's qualification as a
real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. The
Borrower will maintain adequate records so as to comply with all record-keeping
requirements relating to its qualification as a real estate investment trust as
required by the Code and applicable regulations of the Department of the
Treasury promulgated thereunder and will properly prepare and timely file with
the Internal Revenue Service all returns and reports required thereby.

         8.13     Addition and Release of Mortgaged Properties and Subsidiary
Guarantors. (a) At any time and from time to time, the Borrower may, with the
approval of the Required Lenders (which approval may be granted, withheld or
delayed in their sole discretion), add one or more Real Estate Assets to the
Borrowing Base as Mortgaged Properties (each, an "Additional Mortgaged
Property"). Prior to the addition of any Real Estate Asset to the Borrowing Base
as an Additional Mortgaged Property, the Borrower shall have (A) satisfied the
requirements set forth in Section 5 with respect thereto as if such Real Estate
Asset were an Initial Mortgaged Property and the Addition Date therefor were the
Effective Date and (B) delivered to the Administrative Agent (i) a certificate
of a Senior Financial Officer of the Borrower specifying the Real Estate Asset
to be so added to the Borrowing Base and the Addition Date therefor and
certifying (in reasonable detail) that such Real Estate Asset satisfies the
Mortgaged Property Conditions and that the requirements set forth in Section 5
have been so satisfied with respect thereto, (ii) a new Borrowing Base
Certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(j)(iii), (iii) to the extent that such Real
Estate Asset is owned by a Person other than a then existing Credit Party, a


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

counterpart of the Subsidiaries Guaranty executed by such Person together with
all other relevant officer's certificates, resolutions, opinions of counsel and
other documentation of the type described in Sections 5.02 and 5.03 as such
Person would have had to deliver if such Person were a Credit Party on the
Effective Date, and (iv) counterpart originals or certified copies of such other
documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order to
establish compliance with the conditions set forth in this Section 8.13(a). Not
later than ten (10) days prior to each Addition Date, the Borrower shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent fully executed counterparts of the Security
Documents with respect to such Additional Mortgaged Property and related
Collateral and supplements to the schedules to this Agreement, the Security
Agreement and the Environmental Indemnity reflecting the designation of such
Additional Mortgaged Property on such date, all of which shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Upon satisfaction of the requirements
of this Section 8.13(a) and the occurrence of the Addition Date with respect
thereto, and subject to the continued compliance of any such Additional
Mortgaged Property with the Mortgaged Property Conditions, such Additional
Mortgaged Property shall be included in the Borrowing Base as a Mortgaged
Property. The Administrative Agent shall be authorized to, and hereby agrees
that it will, at the expense of the Borrower execute such documentation as may
be necessary to evidence such addition (which documentation shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent). All other
proceedings taken or to be taken in connection with such addition and all
documents incidental thereto shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the Administrative Agent.

         (b) At any time and from time to time but only so long as no Default or
Event of Default then exists or would result therefrom, the Borrower shall have
the right, exercisable pursuant to a written notice (each, a "Mortgaged Property
Release Notice"), to remove one or more Mortgaged Properties from the Borrowing
Base. Each Mortgaged Property Release Notice pursuant to this Section 8.13(b)
shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent and shall be accompanied by (i) a
certificate of a Senior Financial Officer of the Borrower (x) specifying the
Mortgaged Property to be removed and the Release Date therefor, (y) certifying
that no Default or Event of Default then exists or, after taking the actions
described in clause (iii) below in this Section 8.13(b), would result therefrom
and (z) certifying (and showing the calculations therefor in reasonable detail)
that the Borrower will be in compliance with Section 9.14 after giving effect to
the removal of such Mortgaged Property from the Borrowing Base and any repayment
of outstanding Loans required by Section 4.02(b) in connection therewith, (ii) a
new Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(j)(iv), (iii) any
repayment of outstanding Loans as, and to the extent, required by Section
4.02(b), and (iv) all documents (which shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) necessary to evidence the release of
such Mortgaged Property and related Collateral on the applicable Release Date
from the Liens of the Security Documents. Upon the satisfaction of the
requirements set forth in this Section 8.13(b) with respect to a Mortgaged
Property, such Mortgaged Property shall no longer be a Mortgaged Property and
shall be removed from the Borrowing Base and the Liens of the Security Documents
on such Mortgaged Property and related Collateral shall be released by the
Administrative Agent, in each case on the applicable Release Date, and the
Subsidiary Guarantor which is the owner thereof shall, unless such Subsidiary
Guarantor is Holdings, TRE or a Subsidiary Guarantor described in Section
8.13(f) or such Subsidiary Guarantor continues to own or lease one or more other
Mortgaged Properties, be released from its obligations under the Subsidiaries
Guaranty without any further action on the part of any party hereto. The
Adminis-


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

trative Agent shall be authorized to, and hereby agrees that it will, at
the expense of the Borrower, execute such documentation as may be necessary to
evidence such removal and release. All other proceedings taken or to be taken in
connection with such release and all documents incidental thereto shall be
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrative Agent.

         (c) In the event that at any time any Mortgaged Property fails to
satisfy each of the Mortgaged Property Conditions, the Borrower may elect to
remove such Mortgaged Property from the Borrowing Base pursuant to Section
8.13(b). Upon the satisfaction of the requirements set forth in Section 8.13(b)
with respect to such Mortgaged Property, such Mortgaged Property shall no longer
be a Mortgaged Property and shall be removed from the Borrowing Base and the
Liens of the Security Documents on such Mortgaged Property and related
Collateral shall be released by the Administrative Agent, in each case on the
applicable Release Date, and, provided that no Default or Event of Default then
exists, any Subsidiary of the Borrower which is the owner thereof shall, unless
such Subsidiary Guarantor is Holdings, TRE or a Subsidiary Guarantor described
in Section 8.13(f) or such Subsidiary Guarantor continues to own or lease one or
more other Mortgaged Properties, be released from its obligations under the
Subsidiaries Guaranty without any further action on the part of any party
hereto.

         (d) In the event that at any time the Mortgaged Properties included in
the Borrowing Base (excluding any Excluded Mortgaged Properties) shall not be
greater than 85% leased in the aggregate (based on rentable square footage) (the
"Lease-Up Condition"), then, within 10 days of such condition not being
satisfied, the Borrower shall designate (an "Excluded Mortgaged Property
Designation") one or more Mortgaged Properties as Excluded Mortgaged Properties
such that, following such designation, the Lease-Up Condition will be satisfied.
Each Excluded Mortgaged Property Designation shall be delivered to the
Administrative Agent and each Lender and shall be accompanied by (i) a new
Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(j)(v) and (ii) any repayment
of outstanding Loans as, and to the extent, required by Section 4.02(b).

         (e) At any time and from time to time but only so long as no Default or
Event of Default then exists or would result therefrom, the Borrower shall have
the right to sell Equity Interests in any Subsidiary Guarantor (other than
Holdings) by written notice to the Administrative Agent. Each such written
notice shall be accompanied by (i) a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer
of the Borrower specifying the Equity Interests to be sold and (x) certifying
that no Default or Event of Default then exists or, after taking the actions
described in clause (iii) below in this Section 8.13(e), would result therefrom
and (y) that the Mortgaged Property Conditions continue to be satisfied as to
the Mortgaged Property(ies) continued to be owned or leased by such Subsidiary
Guarantor, (ii) a new Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(j)
(vi) and (iii) any repayment of outstanding Loans as, and to the extent,
required by Section 4.02(b).

         (f) The Borrower shall cause any direct Subsidiary of the Borrower (or
the Co-Borrower if formed) which (i) is formed after the Effective Date, (ii)
owns, directly or indirectly, a Real Estate Asset and (iii) is not a then
existing Credit Party, to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender a counterpart of the Subsidiaries Guaranty together with all other
relevant officer's certificates, resolutions, opinions of counsel and other
documentation


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

of the type described in Sections 5.02 and 5.03 as such Person would have had to
deliver if such Person were a Credit Party on the Effective Date.

         (g) Additional Taxes. In the event of the enactment after the Effective
Date of any law of the state where any Mortgaged Property is located or of any
other governmental entity of such state deducting from the value of such
Mortgaged Property for the purpose of taxation any lien or security interest
thereon, or imposing upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender the payment of
the whole or any part of the taxes or assessments or charges or liens required
to be paid by the Mortgaged Property Owner of such Mortgaged Property, or
changing in any way the laws relating to the taxation of mortgages or security
agreements or debts secured by mortgages or security agreements or the interest
of the mortgagee or secured party in the property covered thereby, or the manner
of collection of such taxes, so as to adversely affect the Security Documents or
the indebtedness and other obligations secured thereby or the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders, then, and in any such event, the Borrower, upon demand by
the Administrative Agent, shall pay such taxes, assessments, charges or liens,
or reimburse the Administrative Agent or the Lenders therefor; provided,
however, that if (a) it is unlawful for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
to require the Borrower to make such payment, or (b) the making of such payment
might result in the imposition of interest beyond the maximum amount permitted
by Applicable Laws, then and in either such event, the Administrative Agent may
elect, by notice in writing given to the Borrower, require the Borrower to
remove the applicable Mortgaged Property from the Borrowing Base pursuant to
Section 8.13(b) within six (6) months after request therefor by the
Administrative Agent.

         8.14     Appraisals. The Administrative Agent may from time to time
(and shall upon the written request of (x) the Required Lenders or (y) the
Borrower, which request by the Borrower shall be made no more than once in each
calendar year) obtain an Appraisal of any Mortgaged Property (which Appraisal
shall, if applicable with respect to any restoration or renovation of such
Mortgaged Property, contain an estimate of the appraised value of such Mortgaged
Property upon completion of such restoration or renovation) and the Borrower
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with the
Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent to conduct such Appraisals;
provided that the Administrative Agent shall not obtain an Appraisal for any
Mortgaged Property more than once in any calendar year unless (a) an Event of
Default has occurred, (b) such Appraisal is being obtained in connection with
the proposed restoration of a Mortgaged Property pursuant to paragraph
2(b)(ii)(7) of Schedule 8.03(c) or (c) the Administrative Agent reasonably
believes that one or more events have occurred which could reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a materially adverse
impact on the value of such Mortgaged Property or a Material Adverse Effect. In
the event that any Credit Party or any of its respective Subsidiaries obtains an
appraisal of one or more of the Mortgaged Properties other than pursuant to this
Section 8.14, the Borrower shall deliver a copy of such appraisal to the
Administrative Agent promptly upon the completion thereof and the Administrative
Agent may elect, in its sole discretion and subject to the approval of the
Required Lenders and Applicable Laws, to treat such appraisal as an Appraisal.
In the event that the Administrative Agent obtains an Appraisal of any Mortgaged
Property and an Event of Default does not exist, the Administrative Agent shall
deliver a copy of such Appraisal to the Borrower upon the completion thereof.
The Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of any Appraisal obtained by or
delivered to it pursuant to this Section 8.14 to each Lender. Any increase or
decrease in the Appraised Value of a Mortgaged Property as reflected in an
updated


                                      -51-
<PAGE>

Appraisal shall be shown on the next Borrowing Base Certificate delivered to the
Lenders pursuant to Section 8.01(j); provided, however, that before an increase
in Appraised Value with respect to a Mortgaged Property may be taken into
account in calculating the Borrowing Base Property Value of such Mortgaged
Property, the Borrower must amend the Mortgage encumbering such Mortgaged
Property to the extent necessary to cause the full amount of the increased
Appraised Value to be encumbered by the Lien of such Mortgage.

         8.15     Mortgaged Properties. (a) If any Mortgaged Property is
encumbered by a Lien which is not a Permitted Encumbrance, the Borrower shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly discharge or cause to be discharged
by payment to the lienor or lien claimant or promptly secure removal by bonding
or deposit with the county clerk or otherwise or, at the Administrative Agent's
option, promptly obtain insurance against, any such Lien within thirty (30) days
after the date of notice thereof, but compliance with the provisions of this
Section 8.15(a) shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the provisions of
Section 9.01. The Borrower shall fully preserve the Lien and the priority of
each of the Security Documents without cost or expense to the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders.

         (b) If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail to promptly
discharge, remove or bond off any Lien which is not a Permitted Encumbrance
within thirty (30) days after the date of notice thereof, then the
Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, procure the release and
discharge of such Lien, and any judgment or decree thereon, and in furtherance
thereof may, in its sole discretion, effect any settlement or compromise with
the lienor or post any bond or furnish any security or indemnity as the
Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may elect. In settling,
compromising or arranging for the discharge of any Lien under this Section
8.15(b), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to establish or confirm
the validity or amount of the Lien. The Borrower agrees that all costs and
expenses expended or otherwise incurred by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section 8.15(b) (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements) shall be paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
promptly following demand therefor.

         (c) The Administrative Agent may at any time obtain an updated title
and/or lien search regarding any Mortgaged Property or any other Collateral, and
any such search shall be at the expense of the Borrower if it is being done (i)
because the Administrative Agent reasonably believes that a Lien which is not a
Permitted Encumbrance may encumber any Mortgaged Property or other Collateral,
(ii) following a change in Applicable Laws or the state or organization of any
Mortgaged Property Owner or (iii) after the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default.

         (d) (i) The Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent the
following Appraisals and reports with respect to each of the Initial Mortgaged
Properties: (x) an Appraisal, (y) a written Phase I environmental report (and if
recommended by such report, a written Phase 2 environmental report) in favor of
the Administrative Agent and prepared and certified by an environmental
consultant satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (z) an engineering
report in favor of the Administrative Agent and prepared and certified by an
engineer satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. In the event that the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower on or prior to January 15, 2003 that
any such Appraisal or report is not reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the Required Lenders, the applicable Initial Mortgaged Property
shall, 15


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

Business Days following such notification by the Administrative Agent, be deemed
an Excluded Mortgaged Property and excluded from the calculation of the
Borrowing Base Value until the date, if any, on which the Administrative Agent
notifies the Borrower that such Appraisal or report, as applicable, is
satisfactory to the Required Lenders as aforesaid. On the date that any Initial
Mortgage Property is deemed an Excluded Mortgaged Property and excluded from the
calculation of the Borrowing Base Value pursuant to this Section 8.15(d)(i), the
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (A) a new Borrowing Base
Certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(j)(v) and (B) any repayment of outstanding
Loans as, and to the extent, required by Section 4.02(b).

         (ii) The Borrower covenants and agrees (x) to determine to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent (by means of a Phase II
environmental audit report with respect to subsurface soil and/or groundwater or
by other means reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) not later
than March 31, 2003 whether the Initial Mortgaged Property known as Newmarket
Business Park and referred to as item 3 in Schedule III is subject to or
otherwise affected by any adverse environmental conditions or Environmental
Claims as a result of the operation of a gasoline service station formerly
located thereon, and (y) to cause the applicable Mortgaged Property Owner to
comply with its obligations under the Environmental Indemnity with respect to
any such adverse environmental conditions or Environmental Claims. In the event
that the Borrower fails to comply with its obligations under clause (x) of the
immediately preceding sentence on or prior to March 31, 2003, such Initial
Mortgaged Property shall on such date be deemed an Excluded Mortgaged Property
and excluded from the calculation of the Borrowing Base Value until the date, if
any, on which the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that it has
determined that the Borrower has fully complied with clause (x) of the
immediately preceding sentence. On the date that any Initial Mortgage Property
is deemed an Excluded Mortgaged Property and excluded from the calculation of
the Borrowing Base Value pursuant to this Section 8.15(d)(ii), the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (A) a new Borrowing Base Certificate
pursuant to Section 8.01(j)(v) and (B) any repayment of outstanding Loans as,
and to the extent, required by Section 4.02(b).

         (iii) The Borrower covenants and agrees to cause each underground
storage tank for Hazardous Material located at the Initial Mortgaged Properties
known as 9800 La Cienega Boulevard, Inglewood, California and St. Louis Place,
St. Louis, Missouri and referred to as items 4 and 11 of Schedule III to comply
in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable Environmental
Laws or to cause any such underground storage tank which does not so comply to
be removed, in any case not later than March 31, 2003. In the event that the
Borrower fails to comply with its obligations under the immediately preceding
sentence with respect to any of such Initial Mortgaged Properties on or prior to
March 31, 2003, the applicable Initial Mortgaged Property shall on such date be
deemed an Excluded Mortgaged Property and excluded from the calculation of the
Borrowing Base Value until the date, if any, on which the Administrative Agent
notifies the Borrower that it has determined that the Borrower has satisfied its
obligations under the immediately preceding sentence. On the date that any
Initial Mortgage Property is deemed an Excluded Mortgaged Property and excluded
from the calculation of the Borrowing Base Value pursuant to this Section
8.15(d)(iii), the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (A) a new
Borrowing Base Certificate pursuant to Section 8.01(j)(v) and (B) any repayment
of outstanding Loans as, and to the extent, required by Section 4.02(b).

         (iv) The Borrower covenants and agrees (x) to implement in all material
respects all asbestos operations and maintenance plans as in effect on the
Effective Date with respect to the Initial Mortgaged Properties known as
Northstar Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota and 500 Jefferson, Houston, Texas and
referred to as items 6 and 7 in Schedule III and (y) otherwise to comply with
all applicable Environmental Laws relating to the identification, presence,
containment and removal of asbestos-containing and suspected asbestos-containing
materials at the Mortgaged Properties.

         SECTION 9.  Negative Covenants. The Borrower hereby covenants and
agrees that on and after the Effective Date and until the Total Commitment and
all Letters of Credit have terminated and the Loans, Notes and Unpaid Drawings
(in each case together with interest thereon) and all other Obligations incurred
hereunder and thereunder, are paid in full:

         9.01     Liens. The Borrower will not, nor will the Borrower permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon
any asset of any Credit Party (including, but not limited to, any Mortgaged
Property (or any other Property thereon) or any capital stock or other Equity
Interest owned by such Credit Party) or on the capital stock or other Equity
Interest of the Co-Borrower if formed or any Mortgaged Property Owner (all of
the foregoing assets and Equity Interests subject to such restrictions are
referred to as "Restricted Property"), in either case whether now owned or
leased or hereafter acquired or leased, or sell any Restricted Property subject
to an understanding or agreement, contingent or otherwise, to repurchase such
Restricted Property (including sales of accounts receivable with or without
recourse generated from any of the Restricted Properties, but excluding (i) the
right to sell, transfer, convey or issue limited partnership interests (if the
Co-Borrower is a limited partnership) or non-managing member interests (if the
Co-Borrower is a limited liability company) in the Co-Borrower so long as the
condition set forth in Section 8.04(ii) is not violated thereby, and (ii) the
right of any Person which is not the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower to
convert an Equity Interest in the Co-Borrower into an Equity Interest in the
Borrower), or assign any right to receive the income or profits therefrom or
authorize the filing of any financing statements under the UCC or any other
similar notice Lien under any similar recording or notice of statute, except
("Permitted Encumbrances"):

         (a) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies not
yet due or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings,

         (b) (x) carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics', suppliers',
materialmen's repairmen's or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of
business and (y) Liens on Real Estate Assets arising in the ordinary course of
business in favor of the Federal or any state or local government arising as a
result of noncompliance with any statute or regulation applicable to such Real
Estate Assets, in either case (in the case of preceding clauses (x) and (y))
that do not secure Indebtedness for borrowed money and either (i) have not been
outstanding for a period of more than 45 days and do not materially detract from
the value of the Restricted Property subject to any such Liens or materially
impair the use of such Restricted Property in the operation of the business of
such Credit Party or (ii) that are being contested in good faith by appropriate


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

proceedings with respect to which adequate reserves have been maintained in
accordance with GAAP, which proceedings have the effect of preventing or staying

connection with workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and other social
security legislation;

         (d) utility deposits and other deposits to secure the performance of

not recorded) incurred in the ordinary course of business that do not in any
case materially detract from the value of the property subject thereto or
materially interfere with the ordinary conduct of the business of any Credit
Party;

         (f) Liens arising out of the existence of judgments or awards not
constituting a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.06 and (i) which
have been or will be bonded (and the Lien thereby removed other than on any cash
serving as security for such bond) or released of record within thirty (30) days
after the date that such judgment or award is entered or (ii) in respect of
which any Credit Party shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or
proceedings for review and in respect of which there shall have been secured a
subsisting stay of execution pending such appeal or proceedings, provided that

Property or the Equity Interests of the Co-Borrower if formed or any Mortgaged
Property Owner;

to secure Indebtedness incurred solely for the purpose of financing the
acquisition of any such equipment, machinery or materials or extensions,
renewals or replacements of any of the foregoing for the same or a lesser
amount, provided that (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all such
Indebtedness at any time that is allocable to, or otherwise associated with, any
Real Estate Asset shall not exceed $1,000,000 and (ii) in all


                                      -55-

events, the Lien encumbering the equipment, machinery or materials so acquired
does not encumber any other asset of any Credit Party or any other Restricted
Property;

         (i) Liens solely on the Equity Interests of a Subsidiary of the
Borrower (which is not the Co-Borrower if formed or a Subsidiary Guarantor) or
on the Equity Interests of an Unconsolidated Entity, in either case which have
been pledged to secure Indebtedness of such Subsidiary or Unconsolidated Entity,
provided that there is no Recourse to the Credit Party pledging such Equity
Interests or its Restricted Property except against the pledged Equity Interests
of the Subsidiary or Unconsolidated Entity that incurred such Indebtedness;

         (j) Liens in favor of, and owned by, the Borrower;

property subject thereto and the obligations secured thereby described, in
Schedule 9.01, plus renewals, replacements and extensions of such Liens,

recent appraisal of such Real Estate Asset prepared by an independent appraiser
or based on such other evidence as may be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent) and (B) in the case of the Liens described in item 2 on
such Schedule 9.01, the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness, if any,
secured by such Liens does not increase from that amount outstanding at the time
of any such renewal, replacement or extension, (y) any such renewal, replacement
or extension does not encumber any additional Restricted Property (other than
"products" and "proceeds" thereof or customary after acquired property, as each
such term is defined in the UCC of the State of New York) and (z) in all events,
such Liens do not now nor will they in the future encumber any Mortgaged
Property or the Equity Interests of the Co-Borrower if formed, Holdings or any
Mortgaged Property Owner and, except as and to the extent set forth in item 2 of
Schedule 9.01, the only recourse in respect of the obligations secured by such
Liens is against the Restricted Property subject to such Liens; and

         (l) Liens created or required by the Credit Documents.

         9.02     Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets, etc. (a) The Borrower
will not, nor will the Borrower permit any other Credit Party to, wind up,
liquidate or dissolve its affairs, discontinue its business, or enter into any
transaction of merger or consolidation, or agree to do any of the foregoing at
any future time without a contingency relating to obtaining any required
approval hereunder, except that so long as no Specified Default or Event of
Default then exists or would result therefrom (including, without limitation, an
Event of Default under Section 8.04 or 10.09), the following shall be permitted:
(i) any then existing Subsidiary of the Borrower may be merged or consolidated
with or into, or be liquidated into, the Borrower (so long as the Borrower is

the Borrower at such time may be merged or consolidated with or into, or
liquidated into, the Borrower (so long as the Borrower is the surviving
Company), the Co-Borrower if formed (so long as the Co-Borrower is the surviving
entity) or a Subsidiary Guarantor (so long as the Subsidiary Guarantor is the
surviving

Company), provided that, in the case of this clause (ii), (x) the Person which
is merged or consolidated into such Credit Party is predominantly in the
commercial real estate business, (y) if rated, the creditworthiness of the
Borrower's long term unsecured debt or implied senior debt, as applicable, after
giving effect to such merger or consolidation is not lower than the Borrower's
creditworthiness two months immediately preceding such merger or consolidation,

         (b) The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, consummate any Asset Sale, except that during any fiscal quarter of the
Borrower, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries may effect an Asset Sale so long as
(i) no Specified Default or Event of Default then exists or would result
therefrom, (ii) the consideration received (taking the amount of all cash and
the fair market value, as reasonably determined by the Borrower, of all non-cash
consideration) from such Asset Sale, together with the aggregate consideration
received from all other Asset Sales effected by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries during such fiscal quarter simultaneously with or prior to such
Asset Sale, shall not exceed 2.5% of the Fair Market Value of the Borrower
unless the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent prior written
notice of such Asset Sale, which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of
a Senior Financial Officer of the Borrower certifying (and showing the
calculations therefor in reasonable detail) that the Borrower will be in
compliance with Sections 9.10 and 9.11 after giving effect to such Asset Sale,
and (iii) in the event that any such Asset Sale includes a Mortgaged Property or
any Equity Interests in any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Borrower also shall have
complied with the provisions of Section 8.13(b).

no event shall the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries convey, lease, sell,

except:

         (a) any Subsidiary of the Borrower (other than the Co-Borrower if
formed) may distribute Dividends to holders of its Equity Interests, in each
case so long as the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower which owns an
Equity Interest in such Subsidiary receives a percentage of any such Dividends
which is at least equal to its percentage Equity Interest in its respective
Subsidiary distributing the Dividend (taking into account, however, the relative
preferences, if any, of the various classes of Equity Interest of such
Subsidiary); and

         (b) (i) the Borrower may from time to time pay Dividends to the owners
of its Equity Interests (including, without limitation, Dividends consisting of
the repurchase of any such Equity Interests) so long as (x) the aggregate amount

Borrower to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust under Sections
856 through 860 of the Code; and

         (ii) the Co-Borrower if formed may pay Dividends to the Borrower and
all other holders of Equity Interests in the Co-Borrower (including, without
limitation, but subject to Section 8.04(b)(ii), Dividends consisting of the
repurchase of any such Equity Interests) so long as (x) the aggregate amount of
all such Dividends paid or made by the Co-Borrower in any fiscal year of the
Co-Borrower does not exceed 90% of Funds From Operations of the Co-Borrower for
such fiscal year and (y) the aggregate amount of all such Dividends paid or made
by the Co-Borrower for the first three fiscal quarters of the Co-Borrower in any
fiscal year of the Co-Borrower does not exceed 100% of Funds From Operations of
the Co-Borrower for such three fiscal quarter period; provided, however, at any
time that a Specified Default or an Event of Default then exists or would result

the existence of any Specified Default or Event of Default, any such Subsidiary
may refinance any Secured Indebtedness outstanding on the Effective Date to the
extent that any such refinancing occurs no earlier than six months prior to the
final scheduled maturity of such Secured Indebtedness, and (ii) based on
calculations made by the Borrower, the Borrower will be in compliance with

Section 9.04, (i) in no event will the Borrower permit any of its Subsidiaries
that are not Credit Parties or any of its Unconsolidated Entities to contract,
create, incur or assume after the date hereof any Secured Indebtedness for which
there is Recourse to any Credit Party in connection with Land held for
Development or Land under Development (including the acquisition of any Real

Indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Permitted Debt Amount applicable to
such Secured Indebtedness and (ii) in no event will any Credit Party contract,
create, incur or assume after the date hereof any Indebtedness for borrowed
money (or any guarantees thereof) that would constitute Unsecured Indebtedness,

(expressed as a percentage) of (x) the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount
of all Revolving Loans outstanding at such time and (ii) the aggregate amount of
all Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time to (y) the Total Commitment at
such time.

                  "Wholly-Owned Subsidiary" shall mean, as to any Person, (i)
any corporation 100% of whose capital stock (other than directors' qualifying
shares and other nominal amounts of shares required by applicable law to be held
by Persons (other than directors)) is at the time owned by such Person and/or
one or more Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of such Person and (ii) any partnership,
limited liability company, association, joint venture or other entity in which
such Person and/or one or more Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries of such Person has a
100% Equity Interest at such time. For purposes of this definition, the
Co-Borrower if formed shall be deemed to be a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the
Borrower as long as the requirements of Section 8.04(b) continue to be satisfied
with respect to the Co-Borrower.

                  SECTION 12. The Administrative Agent.

                  12.01 Appointment. The Lenders hereby irrevocably designate
and appoint DBTCA as Administrative Agent to act as specified herein and in the
other Credit Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each
holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to
authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on their behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any other
instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such
powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically
delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its
respective officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

                  12.02 Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and in the other Credit Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be
liable to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or
under any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless
caused by its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The
duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or
any other Credit Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or
the holder of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to
impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein or
therein.

                  12.03 Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent.
Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and the holder of each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and
shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial
condition and affairs of the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans, the issuance of and
participation in Letters of Credit and the taking or not taking of any action in
connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the
Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries and, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information with respect
thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at
any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements,
information, representations or warranties herein or in any document,
certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the
execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection,
collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or the financial condition of the Credit Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the financial condition of the Credit
Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the existence or possible
existence of any Default or Event of Default.

                  12.04 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall have the right to request instructions from the
Required Lenders at any time. If the Administrative Agent shall request
instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any act or action
(including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or
taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received
instructions from the Required Lenders; and the Administrative Agent shall not
incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Lender or the holder of any Note shall have any right of action
whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative
Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Credit
Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders.

                  12.05 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing,
resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier
message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message
signed, sent or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be
the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this
Agreement and any other Credit Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder,
upon advice of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent (which may be
counsel for any of the Credit Parties) and, with respect to other matters, upon
advice of independent public accountants or other experts selected by it.

                  12.06 Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent
is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Credit Parties, the Lenders will
reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent, in proportion to their
respective "percentages" as used in determining the Required Lenders, for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind
or nature which may be


                                     -102-
<PAGE>
imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in
performing its respective duties hereunder or under any other Credit Document,
in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

                  12.07 The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity.
With respect to its obligation to make Loans, or issue or participate in Letters
of Credit, under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights
and powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may exercise the same rights and
powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the
term "Lenders," "Required Lenders," "holders of Notes" or any similar terms
shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
banking, investment banking, advisory, trust or other business with any Credit
Party or any Affiliate of a Credit Party as if it were not performing the duties
specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any Credit
Party for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without
having to account for the same to the Lenders.

                  12.08 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until
a written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case
may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or indorsee, as the
case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

                  12.09 Resignation by the Administrative Agent; Removal of the
Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may resign from the
performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and/or under the other
Credit Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to
the Lenders and the Borrower. Such resignation shall take effect upon the
appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to clauses (b) and (c)
below or as otherwise provided below.

                  (b) Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders
shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder which
shall be a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Borrower.

                  (c) If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so
appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the
consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall serve
as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if any, as the
Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.


                                     -103-
<PAGE>

                  (d) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed
pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above by the 20th Business Day after the date such
notice of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent's resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall
thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or
under any other Credit Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

                  (e) Upon resignation of the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section 12.09, the Administrative Agent shall remain indemnified to the
extent provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the
provisions of this Section 12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
Administrative Agent for all of its actions and inactions while serving as the
Administrative Agent.

                  (f) In addition, the Required Lenders shall have the right to
remove the Administrative Agent and appoint a successor Administrative Agent who
shall be a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Borrower in the event that the Administrative Agent has been grossly negligent
or has willfully misconducted itself in performing its functions and duties
under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 13. Miscellaneous.

                  13.01 Payment of Expenses, etc. The Borrower shall: (i)
whether or not the transactions herein contemplated are consummated, pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of (A) the Administrative Agent and
its affiliates (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and

and delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents
and instruments referred to herein and therein, any addition of a Real Estate

efforts (including, without limitation, printing, distribution and meetings)
with respect to this Agreement and (C) the Administrative Agent and its
affiliates and, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, each of the Lenders
in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents and the documents and instruments referred to herein and therein or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "workout" or pursuant to any
insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings (including, in each case in respect of
preceding clauses (A), (B) and (C) without limitation, (x) the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel and consultants for the Administrative Agent and
its affiliates (it being understood that, for purposes of this clause (i), the
Administrative Agent and its affiliates shall be entitled to be reimbursed for
one primary counsel and one local counsel in each Situs State and, to the extent
that the Administrative Agent in its good faith reasonable discretion determines
that additional counsel is necessary or advisable, for one single additional
foreign counsel in each jurisdiction in which the Administrative Agent has made
such a determination) and (y) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, also
the reasonable fees and disbursements of only one counsel for the other Lenders
as a group); (ii) pay and hold the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders
harmless from and against any and all present and future stamp, excise and other
similar documentary taxes with


                                     -104-
<PAGE>
respect to the foregoing matters and save the Administrative Agent and each of
the Lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay or omission (other than to the extent attributable to
the Administrative Agent or such Lender) to pay such taxes; and (iii) indemnify
the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each of their respective
affiliates officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents from and
hold each of them harmless against any and all liabilities, obligations
(including removal or remedial actions), losses, damages, penalties, claims,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including
reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and disbursements) incurred by,
imposed on or assessed against any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or
in any way related to, or by reason of, (a) any investigation, litigation or
other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender is a
party thereto and whether or not such investigation, litigation or other
proceeding is brought by or on behalf of any Credit Party) related to the
entering into and/or performance of this Agreement or any other Credit Document
or the proceeds of any Loans hereunder or the consummation of any transactions
contemplated herein or in any other Credit Document or the exercise of any of
their rights or remedies provided herein or in the other Credit Documents, or
(b) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials in the air, surface,
water or groundwater or on the surface or subsurface of any Real Property at any
time owned, leased or operated by any of the Credit Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, the generation, storage, transportation, handling or
disposal of Hazardous Materials by any of the Credit Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries at any location, whether or not owned, leased or
operated by any of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
the non-compliance of any Real Property at any time owned, leased or operated by
any of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries with foreign,
federal, state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances (including applicable
permits thereunder) applicable to such Real Property, or any Environmental Claim
asserted against any of the Credit Parties, any of their respective Subsidiaries
or any Real Property at any time owned, leased or operated by any of the Credit
Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, including, in each case,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and other
consultants incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or
other proceeding (but excluding any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses to the extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Person to be indemnified (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision)). In addition,
the foregoing indemnification in favor of any director, officer, employee,
representative or agent of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be
solely in their respective capacities as such director, officer, employee,
representative or agent. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or
hold harmless the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other indemnified
person set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is
violative of any law or public policy, the Borrower shall make the maximum
contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified
liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.

                  13.02 Right of Setoff.(a) In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of
limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the
Administrative Agent and each Lender is hereby authorized at any time or from
time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind
to any Credit Party or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby
expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits
(general or special) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by
such Lender (including, without limitation, by


                                     -105-
<PAGE>
branches and agencies of the Administrative Agent or such Lender wherever
located) to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against and on
account of the Obligations and liabilities of the Credit Parties to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or under any of the
other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all interests in
Obligations purchased by such Lender pursuant to Section 13.06(b), and all other
claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although said Obligations,
liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured.

                  (b) NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING SECTION 13.02(a), AT ANY
TIME THAT THE LOANS OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE SECURED BY REAL PROPERTY
LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, NO LENDER OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL EXERCISE A
RIGHT OF SETOFF, LIEN OR COUNTERCLAIM OR TAKE ANY COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION
OR INSTITUTE ANY PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
NOTE UNLESS IT IS TAKEN WITH THE CONSENT OF THE REQUIRED LENDERS OR, TO THE
EXTENT REQUIRED BY SECTION 13.12 OF THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF THE LENDERS, OR
APPROVED IN WRITING BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, IF SUCH SETOFF OR ACTION OR
PROCEEDING WOULD OR MIGHT (PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 580a, 580b, 580d AND 726 OF THE
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE OR SECTION 2924 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE,
IF APPLICABLE, OR OTHERWISE) AFFECT OR IMPAIR THE VALIDITY, PRIORITY, OR
ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LIENS GRANTED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT PURSUANT TO THE
SECURITY DOCUMENTS OR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS
HEREUNDER, AND ANY ATTEMPTED EXERCISE BY ANY LENDER OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
OF ANY SUCH RIGHT WITHOUT OBTAINING SUCH CONSENT SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS
SECTION 13.02(b) SHALL BE SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF EACH OF THE LENDERS AND THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  13.03 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including telex or telecopier) and mailed, telexed, telecopied or delivered: if
to any Credit Party, at the address specified opposite such Credit Party's
signature below or as provided in the Subsidiaries Guaranty, as the case may be;
if to any Lender, at its address specified on Schedule II; and if to the
Administrative Agent, at the Notice Office; or, as to the Borrower, any other
Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, at such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto and, as
to each Lender, at such other address as shall be designated by such Lender in a
written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All such notices

                  13.04 Benefit of Agreement; Assignments; Participations. (a)
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto;
provided, however, the Credit Parties may not assign or transfer any of their
respective rights, obligations or interest hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Lenders and, provided further, that, although any Lender may
transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights hereunder, such Lender
shall remain a "Lender" for all purposes hereunder and the transferee, assignee
or participant, as the case may be, shall not constitute a "Lender" hereunder
and, provided further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participation
under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or
waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such
amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan,
Note or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is not extended beyond
the Maturity Date) in which such participant is participating, or reduce the
rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in
connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in
interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof (it being understood that
any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement or
to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or
Fees payable hereunder), or increase the amount of the participant's
participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a
waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the
Total Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of such
participation, and that an increase in any Commitment (or the available portion
thereof) or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if
the participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof) or (ii)
consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower or the Co-Borrower if
formed of any of their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement.
In the case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights
under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant's
rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set
forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the participant
relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be
determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender
together with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its
Commitments and related outstanding Obligations hereunder to (i)(A) its parent
company and/or any affiliate of such Lender which is at least 50% owned by such
Lender or its parent company or (B) to one or more other Lenders or any
affiliate of any such other Lender which is at least 50% owned by such other
Lender or its parent company (provided that any fund that invests in loans and
is managed or advised by the same investment advisor of another fund which is a
Lender (or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor) shall be treated as an
affiliate of such other Lender for the purposes of this sub-clause (x)(i)(B)),
or (ii) in the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in loans, any
other fund that invests in loans and is managed or advised by the same
investment advisor of such Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor,
or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at least $5,000,000
in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders (provided that,
in the case of an assignment pursuant to this clause (y) at a time when no
Specified Default or Event of Default exists, to the extent that the assignor
Lender is to retain a Commitment after giving effect to such assignment, such
Commitment shall be in an amount equal to at least $5,000,000), of such
Commitment or Commitments and/or outstanding Obligations hereunder to one or
more Eligible Transferees, each of which assignees shall become a party to this
Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment and Assumption


                                     -107-
<PAGE>
Agreement, provided that (i) at such time Schedule I shall be deemed modified to
reflect the Commitments of such new Lender and of the existing Lenders, (ii)
upon the surrender of the Note or Notes by the assigning Lender (or, upon such
assigning Lender's indemnifying the Borrower for any lost Note pursuant to a
customary indemnification agreement) new Notes will be issued, at the Borrower's
expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender upon the request of such
new Lender or assigning Lender, such new Notes to be in conformity with the
requirements of Section 1.05 (with appropriate modifications) to the extent
needed to reflect the revised Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, (iii) the
written consent of the Administrative Agent and, unless a Default or an Event of
Default then exists, the Borrower (each of which consents shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required in connection with any
assignment to an Eligible Transferee pursuant to clause (y) above, (iv) the
Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the
assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of
$3,500, and (v) promptly after such assignment, the Borrower shall have received
from the Administrative Agent notice of any such assignment and of the identity,
nationality and applicable lending office of any such Eligible Transferee that
is not a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code),
together with the copy of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement relating
thereto and, provided further, that such transfer or assignment will not be
effective until recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register pursuant to
Section 13.15. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this Section
13.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder
with respect to its assigned Commitment and/or outstanding Loans. At the time of
each assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b) to a Person which is not
already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such term
is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes,
the respective assignee Lender shall, to the extent legally entitled to do so,
provide to the Borrower the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if
applicable, a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate) described in Section 4.04(b). To
the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's Commitment and
related outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 1.14 or this Section
13.04(b) would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs under
Section 1.10 or 4.04 in excess of those being charged by the respective
assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay such excess increased costs (although the Borrower, in
accordance with and pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be
obligated to pay the costs which are not in excess of those being charged by the
respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment and any subsequent
increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the
date of the respective assignment). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special
purpose funding vehicle ("SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time
by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option
to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender
would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement,
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, its Commitment hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, (iv) no SPC shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure
by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment,


                                     -108-
<PAGE>
waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Loans or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject
to such grant of funding option, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such grant of funding option,
(v) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and
(vi) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
all or any of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such
Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder
shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent and as if
such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees
that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation
under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting
Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which
agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the
date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding
commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute
against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 13.04(b), any
SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting
Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Administrative
Agent and, unless a Default or an Event of Default exists, the Borrower (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)) providing liquidity
and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding
or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis consistent
with the restrictions set forth in Section 13.16 any non-public information
relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider
of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

                  (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any
Lender from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in
support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and,
with prior notice to the Administrative Agent, any Lender which is a fund may
pledge all or any portion of its Notes or Loans to its trustee or to a
collateral agent providing credit or credit support to such Lender in support of
its obligations to its trustee or such collateral agent, as the case may be. No
pledge pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor Lender from any
of its obligations hereunder.

                  13.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on
the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of
dealing between any Credit Party and the Administrative Agent or any Lender
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights, powers and
remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the
Administrative Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand
on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle such Credit Party to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of the


                                     -109-
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent or any Lender to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

                  13.06 Payments Pro Rata. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt
of each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of any Obligations
hereunder, it shall distribute such payment to the Lenders (other than any
Lender that has consented in writing to waive its pro rata share of any such
payment) pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the Obligations
with respect to which such payment was received.

                  (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any
amount hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by
the exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or
otherwise), which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest
on, the Loans, of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received
by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation
then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such Obligation then owed
and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then such
Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or
warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the Borrower
to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation
by all the Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any portion of such
excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest.

                  13.07 Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial statements
to be furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied throughout the periods involved
(except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing
by the Borrower to the Lenders and except, in the case of interim financial
statements, for normal year-end adjustments); provided that except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all computations determining the Borrower's
compliance with Section 9 and the definition of Applicable Margin and all other
defined financial terms relating to the Borrower shall utilize accounting
principles and policies in the United States in conformity with those used to
prepare the historical financial statements described in Section 7.05(a); and
provided further that (i) the financial covenants set forth in Sections 8.11 and
9.10-9.14 shall be calculated without regard to Sears Tower as long as an Event
of Default has not occurred and is not continuing under Section 9.17 and (ii)
shall assume that the Borrower owns 100% of the Equity Interests in the
Co-Borrower if formed as long as the requirements of Section 8.04(b) continue to
be satisfied with respect to the Co-Borrower.

                  (b) All computations of interest and Fees hereunder shall be
made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including
the first day but excluding the last day, except in the case of Letters of
Credit Fees and Facing Fees, the last day shall be included) occurring in the
period for which such interest or Fees are payable; provided that all
computations of interest on Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Prime
Lending Rate shall be based on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of
365 days (or 366 days, as the case maybe).

                  13.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of
counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                  13.10 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective on
the date (the "Effective Date") on which (i) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Required Lenders shall have signed a counterpart hereof (whether
the same or different counterparts) and shall have delivered the same to the
Administrative Agent at the Notice Office or, in the case of the Lenders, shall
have given to the Administrative Agent telephonic (confirmed in writing),
written or telex notice (actually received) at such office that the same has
been signed and mailed to it and (ii) the conditions contained in Section 5 are
met to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders.
Unless the Administrative Agent has received actual notice from any Lender that
the conditions described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence have not been
met to its satisfaction, upon the satisfaction of the condition described in
clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence and upon the Administrative
Agent's good faith determination that the conditions described in clause (ii) of
the immediately preceding sentence have been met, then the Effective Date shall
have been deemed to have occurred, regardless of any subsequent determination
that one or more of the conditions thereto had not been met (although the
occurrence of the Effective Date shall not release the Borrower from any
liability for failure to satisfy one or more of the applicable conditions
contained in Section 5). The Administrative


                                     -112-
<PAGE>
Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt written notice of the
occurrence of the Effective Date.

                  13.11 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several
sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this
Agreement.

                  13.12 Amendment or Waiver; etc. (a) Neither this Agreement nor
any other Credit Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed,
waived, discharged or terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or
termination is in writing signed by the Borrower and the Required Lenders,
provided that no such change, waiver, discharge or termination shall, without
the consent of each Lender (with Obligations being directly modified in the case
of the following clause (i)), (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any
Loan or Note or extend the stated expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond
the Maturity Date, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
or Fees thereon (except in connection with the waiver of applicability of any
post-default increase in interest rates), or reduce the principal amount thereof
(it being understood that any amendment or modification to the financial
definitions in this Agreement or to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a
reduction in the rate or interest or Fees for the purposes of this clause (i)),
(ii) release the Temporary Guarantor from its obligations under the Temporary
Guaranty or release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from
their respective obligations under the Subsidiaries Guaranty (except, in each
case, as expressly permitted by the Credit Documents), (iii) amend, modify or
waive any provision of this Section 13.12 (except for technical amendments with
respect to additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement which
afford the protections to such additional extensions of credit of the type
provided to the Commitments on the Effective Date), (iv) reduce the percentage
specified in the definition of Required Lenders (it being understood that, with
the consent of the Required Lenders, additional extensions of credit pursuant to
this Agreement may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on
substantially the same basis as the extensions of Revolving Loans are included
on the Effective Date) or (v) consent to the assignment or transfer by the
Borrower or the Temporary Guarantor of any of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement; provided further, that no such change, waiver, discharge or
termination shall (1) increase the Commitment of any Lender over the amount
thereof then in effect without the consent of such Lender (it being understood
that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or
Events of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not
constitute an increase of the Commitment of any Lender, and that an increase in
the available portion of any Commitment of any Lender shall not constitute an
increase of the Commitment of such Lender), (2) without the consent of the
Swingline Lender, alter the Swingline Lender's rights or obligations with
respect to Swingline Loans, (3) without the consent of each Issuing Lender,
amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2 or alter its rights or
obligations with respect to Letters of Credit or (4) without the consent of the
Administrative Agent, amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 12 or any
other provision as same relates to the rights or obligations of the
Administrative Agent.

                  (b) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination to any of the provisions of this Agreement as
contemplated by clauses (i) through (v), inclusive, of the first proviso to
Section 13.12(a), the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the
consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not
obtained, then the


                                     -113-
<PAGE>
Borrower shall have the right, so long as all non-consenting Lenders whose
individual consent is required are treated as described in either clause (A) or
(B) below, to either (A) replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with
one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 1.14 so long as at the time
of such replacement, each such Replacement Lender consents to the proposed
change, waiver, discharge or termination or (B) terminate such non-consenting
Lender's Commitments and/or repay all outstanding Loans of such Lender in
accordance with Sections 3.02(b) and/or 4.01(b), provided that, unless the
Commitments that are terminated, and Loans repaid, pursuant to preceding clause
(B) are immediately replaced in full at such time through the addition of new
Lenders or the increase of the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of existing
Lenders (who in each case must specifically consent thereto), then in the case
of any action pursuant to preceding clause (B) the Required Lenders (determined
after giving effect to the proposed action) shall specifically consent thereto;
provided further, that in any event the Borrower shall not have the right to
replace a Lender or repay its Loans solely as a result of the exercise of such
Lender's rights (and the withholding of any required consent by such Lender)
pursuant to the second proviso to Section 13.12(a).

                  13.13 Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including,
without limitation, in Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01 shall
survive the execution, delivery and termination of this Agreement and the Notes
and the making and repayment of the Obligations.

                  13.14 Domicile of Loans. Each Lender may transfer and carry
its Loans at, to or for the account of any office, Subsidiary or Affiliate of
such Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the
extent that a transfer of Loans pursuant to this Section 13.14 would, at the
time of such transfer, result in increased costs under Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06
or 4.04 in excess of those being charged by the respective Lender prior to such
transfer, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such excess increased
costs (although the Borrower, in accordance with and pursuant to the other
provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay the costs which would
apply in the absence of such designation and any subsequent increased costs of
the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective
transfer).

                  13.15 Register. The Borrower hereby designates the
Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower's agent, solely for purposes of
this Section 13.15, to maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will
record the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of
the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such
recordation, or any error in such recordation shall not affect the Borrower's
obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer
of the Commitment of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and
interest on, any Loan made pursuant to this Agreement shall not be effective
until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative
Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitment and Loans and prior to such
recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Loans shall
remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of
all or part of any Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the
Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly
executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section
13.04(b). Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of
assignment or transfer of all or part of a Commitment and any related Loan, or
as soon thereafter


                                     -114-
<PAGE>
as practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note
evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate
principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or
the new Lender at the request of such Lender. The Borrower agrees to indemnify
the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages
and liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against
or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this
Section 13.15, provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify
the Administrative Agent for any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to
the extent that same resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Administrative Agent (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in
a final and non-appealable decision).

                  13.16 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees that it will (x) use
its reasonable efforts not to disclose without the prior consent of the Borrower
(other than to its affiliates and to its or its affiliates' respective
employees, officers, auditors, examiners, advisors or counsel or to another
Lender if the Lender or such Lender's holding or parent company in its
reasonable good faith discretion determines that any such party should have
access to such information, provided such Persons shall be subject to the
provisions of this Section 13.16 to the same extent as such Lender) any
non-public information with respect to any of the Credit Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries which is now or in the future furnished pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Credit Document by the Borrower and (y) use any such
non-public information (A) for purposes relating to this Agreement, the other
Credit Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including, without limitation, in connection with (i) the evaluation,
administration, monitoring or enforcement of any of the Credit Documents or the
Obligations or (ii) satisfying or cooperating in any Person's regulatory or
other compliance requirements) or (B) in connection with other services at the
request or for the benefit of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, provided that
any Lender may disclose any such information (a) as has become generally
available to the public, (b) as may be required or appropriate in any report,
statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or Federal regulatory
body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal
Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar
organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors,
(c) as may be required or appropriate in respect to any summons or subpoena or
in connection with any litigation, (d) in order to comply with any law, order,
regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (e) to the Administrative Agent
or any other Lender and (f) to any prospective or actual transferee or
participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or participation of any
of the Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by such Lender, provided
that such prospective transferee shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 13.16.

                  13.17 Limitation on Additional Amounts, etc. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.06 or 4.04, unless a
Lender gives notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to pay an amount under
the respective Section within 180 days after the later of (x) the date the
Lender incurs the respective increased costs, loss, expense or


                                     -115-
<PAGE>
liability, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on
capital or (y) the date such Lender has actual knowledge of its incurrence of
the respective increased costs, loss, expense or liability, reductions in
amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital, then such
Lender shall only be entitled to be compensated for such amount by the Borrower
pursuant to said Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06 or 4.04, as the case may be, to the
extent the costs, loss, expense or liability, reduction in amounts received or
receivable or reduction in return on capital are incurred or suffered on or
after the date which occurs 180 days prior to such Lender giving notice to the
Borrower that it is obligated to pay the respective amounts pursuant to said
Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06, or 4.04, as the case may be; provided, however, that
if the circumstances giving rise to such claims have a retroactive effect, such
180-day period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive
effect. This Section 13.17 shall have no applicability to any Section of this
Agreement other than said Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06 or 4.04.

                  13.18 No Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties
hereto or their respective permitted successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

                  13.19 Waiver of Sovereign Immunity. To the extent that any
Credit Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any
court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, or otherwise) with respect to
itself or its property, such Credit Party hereby irrevocably waives such
immunity in respect of its obligations hereunder to the extent permitted by
applicable law and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, agrees
that the waivers set forth in this Section 13.19 shall have the fullest extent
permitted under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 of the United
States and are intended to be irrevocable for purposes of such Act.

                  13.20 Judgment Currency. (a) The Credit Parties' obligations
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents to make payments in Dollars (the
"Obligation Currency") shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or
recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency
other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or
recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent or the
respective Lender of the full amount of the Obligation Currency expressed to be
payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or the
other Credit Documents. If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment
against any Credit Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes
necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation
Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment
Currency") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be
made at the rate of exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent in good
faith or if the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such
currency, by a known dealer in such currency designated by the Administrative
Agent) determined, in each case, as of the day on which the judgment is given
(such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency
Conversion Date").

                  (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing
between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of
the amount due, the Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid,
such additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may
be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial
award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.


                                     -116-
<PAGE>
                  (c) For purposes of determining any rate of exchange for this
Section 13.20, such amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in
connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

                  13.21 Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document, the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that all
agreements among them under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are
expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount
paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the
use, forbearance, or detention of the money loaned to the Borrower and evidenced
hereby or thereby or for the performance or payment of any covenant or
obligation contained herein or therein, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If due
to any circumstance whatsoever, fulfillment of any provisions of this Agreement
or any of the other Credit Documents at the time performance of such provision
shall be due shall exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, then, automatically, the
obligation to be fulfilled shall be modified or reduced to the extent necessary
to limit such interest to the Highest Lawful Rate, and if from any such
circumstance any Lender should ever receive anything of value deemed interest by
applicable law which would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, such excessive
interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount then
outstanding hereunder or on account of any other then outstanding Obligations
and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the
principal unpaid balance then outstanding hereunder and such other then
outstanding Obligations, such excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. All sums
paid or agreed to be paid to the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the use,
forbearance, or detention of the Obligations and other Indebtedness of the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full term of such Indebtedness until payment in full so that the
actual rate of interest on account of all such Indebtedness does not exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate throughout the entire term of such Indebtedness. The terms
and provisions of this Section 13.21 shall control every other provision of this
Agreement and all agreements among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders.

                  13.22 Temporary Guaranty. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that
the Temporary Guarantor has been released from its obligations under the
Temporary Guaranty and has ceased to be a Credit Party under the Existing
Agreement and that the provisions of the Existing Agreement have ceased to be
applicable to the Temporary Guarantor and its Subsidiaries other than the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

                  13.23 Agreement Among Signing Lenders. Each of the Lenders
party to the Existing Agreement which executes and delivers a counterpart of
this Agreement (and the successors and assigns of each such Lender) (each of the
foregoing Lenders and their successors and assigns are herein called "Signing
Lenders") hereby agrees for the benefit of each other Signing Lender, that no
