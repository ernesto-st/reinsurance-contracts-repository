interest of the Indenture Trustee in the Collateral for the benefit of the
Secured Parties; and

         (k) such other documents, instruments, certifications, agreements or

         Upon satisfaction of such conditions, the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, as provided above, such Series of Notes upon execution

         Section 2.3. Series Supplement for Each Series. (a) In conjunction with
the issuance of a new Series, the parties hereto shall execute a Series
Supplement, which shall specify the relevant terms with respect to such new
Series of Notes, which shall include, without limitation, as applicable: (i) the
name or designation of such Series, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Notes
of such Series (which may be a variable amount), (iii) the Note Rate (or the
method for calculating such Note Rate) with respect to such Series, (iv) the
interest payment date or dates and the date or dates from which interest shall
accrue, (v) the method of allocating Collections with respect to such Series and

<PAGE>



such Series of Notes that do not (subject to Section 2.3(b) and Article 12
hereof) change the terms of any outstanding Series of Notes or otherwise
materially conflict with the provisions of this Base Indenture and that do not
prevent the satisfaction of the Rating Agency Confirmation Condition with
respect to each outstanding Series of Notes with respect to the issuance of such
new Series (all such terms, the "Principal Terms" such Series);

         (b) (i) A Series Supplement may specify that the related Series of
Notes (each, a "Segregated Series") will have collateral that is to be solely
for the benefit of the Noteholders of such Segregated Series of Notes and any
other Segregated Series of Notes specified in such Series Supplement (such
collateral being referred to as "Series-Specific Collateral"); provided,
however, that no such Segregated Series of Notes will be issued unless (A) the
Rating Agency Confirmation Condition with respect to each outstanding Series of
Notes is met with respect to the issuance of such Segregated Series of Notes,
(B) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee an Officer's
Certificate to the effect that the issuance of such Segregated Series of Notes
will not have a material adverse effect upon the Noteholders of any Series of
Notes outstanding at the time of the issuance of the Segregated Series of Notes,
and (C) the applicable Series Supplement provides, in form satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee, for the changes and modifications to the Base Indenture and
the other Related Documents as are described in clause (ii) below.

         (ii) In the event any Segregated Series of Notes is issued, the related
Series Supplement will provide that (A) the Indenture Trustee will identify the
collateral for such Segregated Series of Notes such that (1) the Series-Specific
Collateral will secure only the Segregated Series of Notes to which such
Series-Specific Collateral is applicable and (2) the Noteholders with respect to
any other Series of Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of such
Series-Specific Collateral, (B) the Indenture Trustee will adjust the
allocations and distributions to be made under the Base Indenture so that the
Noteholders with respect to the Segregated Series of Notes will be entitled to
allocations and distributions arising solely from the Series-Specific Collateral
applicable to such Segregated Series of Notes and the Noteholders with respect
to the non-Segregated Series of Notes will be entitled to allocations and
distributions arising solely from the non-Series-Specific Collateral, (C) the
Indenture Trustee will act as collateral agent under the Base Indenture (and in
such capacity the Indenture Trustee shall (1) establish and maintain a master
collection account, and one or more segregated collection accounts, into which
Collections allocated to all Series of Notes will be deposited and, after such
deposit, further allocated among one or more Segregated Series of Notes and the
non-Segregated Series of Notes and (2) hold its lien encumbering the
non-Series-Specific Collateral for the benefit of the non-Segregated Series of
Notes and hold its lien encumbering the Series-Specific Collateral for the
benefit of the applicable Segregated Series of Notes), (D) the Noteholders of
the Segregated Series of Notes will, subject to the limitations contained in
this Base Indenture and the applicable Series Supplement, be entitled to direct
the Indenture Trustee in writing to exercise the remedies under the Base
Indenture solely on behalf of such Segregated Series of Notes, (E) separate
monthly


                                       7


<PAGE>


reports and other information will be furnished under the Base Indenture for the
Series-Specific Collateral, which monthly reports and other information will
contain substantially the same type of information as the monthly reports
provided under the Base Indenture prior to the issuance of such Segregated
Series of Notes, (F) the Issuer will take such actions as are necessary to
perfect the Indenture Trustee's interest on behalf of the Noteholders of such
Series in the Series-Specific Collateral, (H) amendments will be made to this
Base Indenture and the other Related Documents, if necessary, to reflect the
foregoing, provided that any such amendment shall not have a material adverse
effect on the Noteholders of any Series unless the Required Noteholders of such
Series shall have given their prior written consent thereto (and, with respect
to each Series, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely on an Officer's
Certificate as sufficient evidence of such lack of a material adverse effect),
(I) for purposes of the Segregated Series, terms that are defined both in the
applicable Series Supplement and in Schedule I to the Base Indenture, shall for
purposes of such Series Supplement and the Base Indenture as it relates to such
Segregated Series, have the meanings assigned to them in such Series Supplement
and (J) references herein to "all" or "each" Series of Notes or words of similar
import (other than as specifically stated herein) shall be modified to refer to
all or each Series of Notes other than any Segregated Series of Notes which may
hereafter be issued.

         Section 2.4. Execution and Authentication. (a) Each Note shall be
executed by the manual or the facsimile signature on behalf of the Issuer by any
of the Authorized Officers of the Issuer. Notes bearing the manual or facsimile
signature of the individual who was, at the time when such signature was
affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Issuer shall not be rendered
invalid, notwithstanding that such individual has ceased to be so authorized
prior to the authentication and delivery of such Notes or does not hold such
office at the date of such Notes.

         (b) From time to time after the execution and delivery of this Base
Indenture, the Issuer may deliver Notes of any particular Series executed by the
Issuer to the Indenture Trustee for authentication, together with one or more
Issuer Orders for the authentication and delivery of such Notes, and the
Indenture Trustee, in accordance with such Issuer Order and this Base Indenture,
shall authenticate and deliver such Notes.

         (c) Unless otherwise provided in the related Series Supplement, no Note
shall be entitled to any benefit under this Base Indenture or be valid for any
purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of authentication
substantially in the form provided for herein, duly executed by the Indenture
Trustee by the manual signature of a Trust Officer and the agent of a foreign
exchange (the "Non-U.S. Exchange Agent"), if such Notes are listed on a non-U.S.
stock exchange, and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only
evidence, that the Note has been duly authenticated under this Base Indenture.
The Indenture Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the
Issuer to authenticate Notes. Unless limited by the term of such appointment, an
authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Indenture Trustee may
do so. Each reference in this Base Indenture to authentication by the Indenture
Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the

                                       8



<PAGE>

same rights as an Agent to deal with the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer.
The Indenture Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be in substantially
the following form:

         This is one of the [ENTER SPECIFIC NAME OF NOTE] (i) of a series issued
under the within mentioned Base Indenture and (ii) designated above and referred
to in the within mentioned [ENTER NAME OF SERIES SUPPLEMENT.].

                                   BANK ONE, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,
                                   not in its individual capacity but solely as
                                   Indenture Trustee,


                                   By:
                                      -----------------------------------------
                                              Authorized Signatory
Date:

         (d) Each Note shall be dated and issued as of the date of its
authentication by the Indenture Trustee.

         (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Note shall have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Issuer,
and the Issuer shall deliver such Note to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation
as provided in Section 2.14 together with a written statement (which need not
comply with Section 13.3 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel)
stating that such Note has never been issued and sold by the Issuer, for all
purposes of this Base Indenture such Note shall be deemed never to have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall not be entitled to the benefits
of this Base Indenture.

         Section 2.5. Form, Issuance and Transfer. The Notes may not be issued,
sold, transferred, assigned, participated, pledged or otherwise disposed of
unless such sale or transfer is pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, and, in each case, in compliance with any
applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws and in accordance with the
restrictions set forth in the applicable Series Supplement. Each Series of Notes
shall be in the form specified in the applicable Series Supplement.

         Section 2.6. Registrar and Paying Agent. (a) The Issuer shall (i)
maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of
transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and where notices and demands to or upon
the Issuer in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served, and (ii)
appoint a paying agent ("Paying Agent") at whose office or agency Notes may be
presented for payment. The Issuer will give prompt written notice to the
Indenture Trustee of the location, and of any change in the location, of any
such office or agency referred to in clause (i) above. If at any time the Issuer
shall fail to maintain any such office or agency referred to in clause (i) above
or shall fail to furnish the Indenture Trustee with the address thereof, such



                                        9


<PAGE>


surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust
Office, and the Issuer hereby appoints the Indenture Trustee as its agent to
receive all such surrenders, notices and demands. The Registrar shall keep a
register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange (the "Note Register").
The Issuer may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional
paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent and
the term "Registrar" includes any co-registrars. The Issuer may change any
Paying Agent or Registrar without prior notice to any Noteholder. The Issuer
shall notify the Indenture Trustee in writing of the name and address of any
Agent not a party to this Base Indenture.

         (b) The Indenture Trustee shall be the initial Registrar for the
purpose of registering Notes and transfers of the Notes, as herein provided.
Upon any resignation of any Registrar, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a
successor or, if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume the duties of
Registrar.

         (c) If a Person other than the Indenture Trustee is appointed by the
Issuer as Registrar, the Issuer will give the Indenture Trustee prompt written
notice of the appointment of such Registrar and of the location, and any change
in the location, of the Note Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the
right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable times and to obtain copies
thereof. The Indenture Trustee shall have the right to rely upon a certificate
executed on behalf of the Note Registrar by an Executive Officer thereof as to
the names and addresses of the Noteholders and the related principal amounts and
numbers of such Notes.

         (d) The Issuer shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with
any Agent not a party to this Base Indenture. Such agency agreement shall
implement the provisions of this Base Indenture that relate to such Agent. The
Issuer shall notify the Indenture Trustee in writing of the name and address of
any such Agent. If the Issuer fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent and
a Trust Officer has actual knowledge of such failure, or if the Issuer fails to
give the foregoing notice, the Indenture Trustee shall act as such, and shall be
entitled to appropriate compensation in accordance with this Base Indenture,
until the Issuer shall appoint a replacement Registrar and Paying Agent.

         Section 2.7. Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust. (a) The Issuer will
cause each Paying Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver
to the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree
with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture Trustee acts as Paying Agent,
it hereby so agrees), subject to the provisions of this Section, that such
Paying Agent will:

         (i) hold all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with
respect to the Notes in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided and pay such sums to such Persons as herein provided;

         (ii) give the Indenture Trustee written notice of any default by the
Issuer (or any other obligor under the Notes) of which it (or, in the case of
the Indenture


                                       10


<PAGE>

Trustee, a Trust Officer) has actual knowledge in the making of any payment
required to be made with respect to the Notes;

         (iii) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Indenture Trustee, forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee
all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent;

         (iv) immediately resign as a Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the
Indenture Trustee all sums held by it in trust for the payment of Notes if at
any time it ceases to meet the standards required to be met by an Indenture
Trustee hereunder at the time of its appointment; and

         (v) comply with all requirements of the Code with respect to the
withholding from any payments made by it on any Notes of any applicable
withholding taxes imposed thereon and with respect to any applicable reporting
requirements in connection therewith.

         (b) The Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Base Indenture or for any other purpose, by
Issuer Order direct any Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums
held in trust by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture
Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held by such
Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Indenture
Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with
respect to such money.

         (c) Subject to applicable laws with respect to escheat of funds, any
money held by the Indenture Trustee, any Paying Agent or any Clearing Agency in
trust for the payment of any amount due with respect to any Note and remaining
unclaimed for two years after such amount has become due and payable shall be
discharged from such trust and be paid to the Issuer on Issuer Request; and the
Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look
only to the Issuer for payment thereof (but only to the extent of the amounts so
paid to the Issuer), and all liability of the Indenture Trustee, such Paying
Agent or such Clearing Agency with respect to such trust money shall thereupon
cease; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent or such
Clearing Agency, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the
expense of the Issuer cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in
the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general
circulation in New York City and, if the related Series of Notes has been listed
on a non-U.S. stock exchange, and if the non-U.S. stock exchange so requires, in
a newspaper customarily published on each local business day for such non-U.S.
stock exchange and of general circulation in the city of such non-U.S. stock
exchange, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date
specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such
publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid
to the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee may also adopt and employ, at the expense
of the Issuer, any other reasonable means of notification of such repayment.



                                       11



<PAGE>


         Section 2.8. Noteholder List. The Indenture Trustee shall preserve in
as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to
it of the names and addresses of Noteholders of each Series of Notes. If the
Indenture Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuer shall furnish to the
Indenture Trustee at least seven Business Days before each Fee Remittance Date
and at such other time as the Indenture Trustee may request in writing, a list
in such form and as of such date as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably require
of the names and addresses of Noteholders of each Series of Notes.

         Section 2.9. Transfer and Exchange. The restrictions and requirements
with respect to the transfer or exchange of Notes shall be specified for each
Series in the related Series Supplement.

         Section 2.10. Legending of Notes. In addition to any legend required by
Section 2.16, each Note shall bear a legend as specified in the applicable
Series Supplement.

         Section 2.11. Replacement Notes. (a) If (i) any mutilated Note is
surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee receives evidence
to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, and (ii)
there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be
required by it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless and
provided that the requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC (which generally
permit the Issuer to impose reasonable requirements) are met, the Issuer shall
execute and upon its request the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Note, a replacement Note; provided, however, that if any such destroyed,
lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note, shall have become or within seven
days shall be due and payable, instead of issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer
may pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable without
surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment of
a destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence, a purchaser for value of the original Note in lieu of which such
replacement Note was issued presents for payment such original Note, the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover such replacement Note (or
such payment) from the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was delivered or
any assignee of such Person, except a purchaser for value, and shall be entitled
to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any
loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in
connection therewith.

         (b) Upon the issuance of any replacement Note under this Section 2.11,
the Registrar, the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer may require the payment by
the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee)
connected therewith.

         (c) Every replacement Note issued pursuant to this Section 2.11, in
replacement of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be entitled
to all the

                                       12


<PAGE>

benefits of this Base Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all
other Notes duly issued hereunder.

         (d) The provisions of this Section 2.11 are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to
the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

         Section 2.12. Treasury Notes. In determining whether the Noteholders of
the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver
or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer (other than
as set forth in the related Series Supplement) shall be considered as though
they are not outstanding, except that for the purpose of determining whether the
Indenture Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or
consent, only Notes of which a Trust Officer of the Indenture Trustee has
received written notice of such ownership shall be so disregarded. Absent
written notice to the Indenture Trustee of such ownership, the Indenture Trustee
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the identity of the individual
beneficial owners of the Notes.

         Section 2.13. Temporary Notes. Pending the preparation of Definitive
Notes if so specified in accordance with the terms of any Series Supplement, the
Issuer may prepare and the Indenture Trustee, upon receipt of a Issuer Order,
shall authenticate and deliver temporary Notes of such Series. Temporary Notes
shall be substantially in the form of Definitive Notes of like Series but may
have variations that are not inconsistent with the terms of this Base Indenture
as the officers executing such Notes may determine, as evidenced by their
execution of such Notes.

         (a) If temporary Notes are issued pursuant to Section 2.13(a) above,
the Issuer will cause Definitive Notes to be prepared without unreasonable
delay. After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be
exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at the
office or agency of the Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 8.2,
without charge to the Noteholder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or
more temporary Notes, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of
Definitive Notes of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary
Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Base
Indenture as Definitive Notes.

         Section 2.14. Cancellation. The Issuer may at any time deliver to the
Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee.
The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Indenture Trustee any Notes
surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The
Indenture Trustee shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of
transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation. The Issuer may not
issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has redeemed or paid or that have been
delivered to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation. All

                                       13



<PAGE>


cancelled Notes held by the Indenture Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance
with the Indenture Trustee's standard disposition procedures unless by a written
order, signed by two Authorized Officers and received by a Trust Officer of the
Indenture Trustee in a timely fashion, the Issuer shall direct that cancelled
Notes be returned to it.

         Section 2.15. Principal and Interest. The principal of each Series of
Notes shall be payable at the times and in the amounts set forth in the related
Series Supplement and in accordance with Section 6.1.

         (a) Each Series of Notes shall accrue interest as provided in the
related Series Supplement and such interest shall be payable at the times and in
the amounts set forth in the related Series Supplement and in accordance with
Section 6.1.

         (b) Except as provided in the following sentence, the Person in whose
name any Note is registered at the close of business on any Record Date with
respect to the Payment Date for such Note shall be entitled to receive the
principal and interest payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding the
cancellation of such Note upon any registration of transfer, exchange or
substitution of such Note subsequent to such Record Date. Any interest payable
at maturity shall be paid to the Person to whom the principal of such Note is
payable.

         (c) If the Issuer defaults in the payment of interest on the Notes of
any Series, such interest, to the extent paid on any date that is more than five
(5) Business Days after the applicable due date, shall, at the option of the
Issuer, cease to be payable to the Persons who were Noteholders of such Series
at the applicable Record Date and the Issuer shall pay the defaulted interest in
any lawful manner, plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted
interest, to the Persons who are Noteholders of such Series on a subsequent
special record date which date shall be at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the payment date, at the rate provided in this Base Indenture and in the Notes
of such Series. The Issuer shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special
record date and payment date, and at least fifteen (15) days before the special
record date, the Issuer (or the Indenture Trustee, in the name of and at the
expense of the Issuer) shall mail to Noteholders of such Series a notice that
states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such
interest to be paid.

         Section 2.16. Book-Entry Notes. (a) Unless otherwise provided in any
related Series Supplement, the Notes, upon original issuance, shall be issued in
the form of typewritten Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes, to be delivered
to the depository specified in such Series Supplement which shall be the

                  UNLESS THIS NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE
         OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION ("DTC"), TO

         REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT
         HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN
         AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE
         HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE

         (c) [Reserved].

         (d) Title to the Notes shall pass only by registration in the Note
Register maintained by the Registrar pursuant to Section 2.6.

         (e) Any typewritten Note or Notes representing Book-Entry Notes shall
provide that they represent the aggregate or a specified amount of outstanding
Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and may also provide that the aggregate
amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be reduced
to reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of a typewritten Note or Notes
representing Book-Entry Notes to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease
in the amount, or changes in the rights of Note Owners represented thereby,
shall be made in such manner and by such Person or Persons as shall be specified
therein or in the Issuer Order to be delivered to the Indenture Trustee pursuant
to Section 2.4(b). Subject to the provisions of Section 2.5, the Indenture
Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any typewritten Note or Notes representing
Book-Entry Notes in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or
Persons specified therein or in the applicable Issuer Order. Any instructions by
the Issuer with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a
typewritten Note or Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes shall be in writing
but need not comply with Section 13.3 hereof and need not be accompanied by an
Opinion of Counsel.

         (f) Unless and until definitive, fully registered Notes ("Definitive
Notes") have been issued to Note Owners with respect to any Series of Notes
pursuant to Section 2.18 or the applicable Series Supplement:

<PAGE>


         (i) the provisions of this Indenture shall be in full force and effect;

         (ii) the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Indenture Trustee may deal
with the Clearing Agency and the Clearing Agency Participants for all purposes
of this Indenture (including the making of payments on the Notes and the giving
of instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole holder of the Notes, and
shall have no obligation to the Note Owners of any Class of Notes;

         (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 2.16 conflict
with any other provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section 2.16
shall control;

         (iv) whenever this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken
based upon instructions or directions of Holders of such Series of Notes
evidencing a specified percentage of the outstanding principal amount of such
Series of Notes, the applicable Clearing Agency shall be deemed to represent
such percentage only to the extent that it has received instructions to such
effect from Note Owners and/or their related Clearing Agency Participants owning
or representing, respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial
interest in such Series of Notes and has delivered such instructions to the
Indenture Trustee; and

         (v) the rights of such Note Owners shall be exercised only through the
applicable Clearing Agency and their related Clearing Agency Participants and
shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Note
Owners and their related Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency
Participants. Unless and until Definitive Notes are issued pursuant to Section
2.18, the applicable Clearing Agencies will make book-entry transfers among
their related Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments of
principal and interest on such Series of Notes to such Clearing Agency
Participants.

         Section 2.17. Notices to Clearing Agency. Whenever notice or other
communication to the Noteholders is required under this Indenture, unless and
until Definitive Notes shall have been issued to Note Owners pursuant to Section
2.18 or the applicable Series Supplement, the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer
shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to
Noteholders to the applicable Clearing Agency for distribution to the Note
Owners.

         Section 2.18. [Reserved].

         Section 2.19. Tax Treatment. The Issuer has structured this Base
Indenture and the Notes have been (or will be) issued with the intention that
the Notes will qualify under applicable tax law as indebtedness of the Issuer
and any entity acquiring any direct or indirect interest in any Note by
acceptance of its Notes (or, in the case of a Note Owner, by virtue of such Note
Owner's acquisition of a beneficial interest therein) agrees to treat the Notes
(or beneficial interests therein) for purposes of Federal, state and local and
income or franchise taxes and any other tax imposed on or measured by income, as
indebtedness of the Issuer. Each Noteholder agrees that it will cause any


                                       16

Note Owner acquiring an interest in a Note through it to comply with this Base
Indenture as to treatment as indebtedness for such tax purposes.

         Section 2.20. CUSIP Numbers. The Issuer may use "CUSIP" numbers in
respect of any Series of Notes (if then generally in use), and, if so, the
Indenture Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption in respect
of such Series of Notes as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such
notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such
numbers either as printed on the Notes of such Series or as contained in any
notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other
identification numbers printed on the Notes of such Series, and any such
redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
The Issuer will promptly notify the Indenture Trustee of any change in any such
"CUSIP" numbers.

however, the foregoing indemnification shall not extend to any action by the
Indenture Trustee or a Noteholder which constitutes negligence or willful
misconduct by the Indenture Trustee, such Noteholder or any other indemnified
person hereunder. The indemnification provided for in this Section 3.2 shall

         Section 5.1. Rights of Noteholders. Each Series of Notes, unless such
Series is designated a Segregated Series, shall be secured by all of the
Collateral, including the benefits of any Enhancement, if any, issued with
respect to such Series and the right to receive the applicable Series Percentage
of Collections and other amounts at the times and in the amounts specified in
this Article 5 to be deposited in the Collection Account and any other accounts
(if so specified in the related Series Supplement) or to be paid to the
Noteholders of such Series. In no event shall the grant of a security interest
in Collateral be deemed to entitle any Noteholder to receive Collections or
other proceeds of the Collateral in excess of the amounts described in this
Article 5.

         Section 5.2. Collection Account.

         (a) Establishment of Collection Account. On or prior to the Initial
Closing Date, the Indenture Trustee shall establish and maintain in the name of
the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties, or cause to be
established and maintained, an account (the "Collection Account"), bearing a
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the
benefit of the Secured Parties. The Indenture Trustee shall possess all right,
title and interest in all moneys, instruments, securities and other property on
deposit from time to time in the Collection Account and the proceeds thereof for
the benefit of the Secured Parties. The Collection Account shall be under the
sole dominion and control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the
Secured Parties. The Collection Account shall be maintained as an Eligible
Deposit Account. If the Collection Account is not maintained in accordance with
the previous sentence, then within 10 Business Days after obtaining knowledge of
such fact, the Indenture Trustee shall establish a new Collection Account which
complies with such sentence and transfer into the new Collection Account all
cash and investments from the non-qualifying Collection Account. Initially, the
Collection Account will be established with Bank One, National Association.

         (b) Establishment of Additional Accounts. To the extent specified in
the Series Supplement with respect to any Series of Notes, the Indenture Trustee
may establish and maintain one or more additional accounts and/or Administrative
Subaccounts to facilitate the proper allocation of Collections in accordance
with the terms of such Series Supplement.

         (c) Administration of the Collection Account. The Issuer shall instruct
the institution maintaining the Collection Account in writing to invest funds on
deposit in the Collection Account (including any administrative subaccounts
thereof) at all times in Eligible Investments selected by the Issuer (by
standing instructions or otherwise); provided, however, that except as provided
in any Series Supplement, any such investment shall mature not later than the
Business Day prior to the applicable Fee

                                       22




<PAGE>


Remittance Date, following the date on which such funds were so invested, except
for any Eligible Investment held in the Collection Account (including any
administrative subaccounts thereof) which is in an investment made by the Paying
Agent institution, in which event such investment may mature on such applicable
Fee Remittance Date, so long as such funds shall be available for withdrawal on
or prior to such applicable Fee Remittance Date. All such Eligible Investments
will be credited to the Collection Account and any such Eligible Investments
that constitute (i) Physical Property (and that is not either a United States
Security Entitlement or a Security Entitlement) shall be delivered to the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with paragraph (a) of the definition of
"Delivery" and shall be held by the Indenture Trustee pending maturity or
disposition; (ii) United States Security Entitlements or Security Entitlements
shall be Controlled by the Indenture Trustee pending maturity or disposition;
and (iii) Uncertificated Securities (and not United States Security
Entitlements) shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee in accordance with
paragraph (b) of the definition of "Delivery" and shall be maintained by the
Indenture Trustee pending maturity or disposition. The Indenture Trustee shall,
at the expense of the Issuer, take such action as is required to maintain the
Indenture Trustee's security interest in the Eligible Investments credited to
the Collection Account. In the absence of written investment instructions
hereunder, funds on deposit in the Collection Account shall remain uninvested.
Neither the Issuer nor the Indenture Trustee shall dispose of (or permit the
disposal of) any Eligible Investments prior to the maturity thereof to the
extent such disposal would result in a loss of principal of such Eligible
Investment.

         (d) Earnings from Collection Account. Subject to the restrictions set
forth above, the Issuer shall have the authority to instruct the Indenture
Trustee (which instructions shall be in writing) with respect to (i) the
investment of funds on deposit in the Collection Account and (ii) the
liquidation of such investments. All interest and earnings (net of losses and
investment expenses) paid on funds on deposit in the Collection Account shall be
deemed to be available and on deposit for distribution.

         Section 5.3. Collections and Allocations. (a) Collections in General.
Until this Base Indenture is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, the Issuer
shall, and the Indenture Trustee is authorized to, cause all Collections due and
to become due to the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, to be
paid directly into the Collection Account no later than the close of business on
the second Business Day after receipt thereof, and the Servicer shall be
instructed to remit all Collections received by it in accordance with the
Servicing Agreement to the Collection Account for deposit therein. In addition,
the Issuer shall deposit to the Collection Account no later than the close of
business on each Determination Date the aggregate Purchase Amounts payable by
the Issuer pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Base Indenture. If the Issuer shall
receive any written statement from the Servicer stating that any amount
previously paid by the Servicer to the Indenture Trustee or Issuer and deposited
into the Collection Account was so paid and deposited into the Collection
Account in error, the Issuer, if it shall concur as to the truth of such
statement, shall forward to the Indenture Trustee in writing, together with such
security or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the Indenture Trustee


                                       23

<PAGE>


harmless, a copy of such written statement from the Servicer, along with an
instruction to the Indenture Trustee to withdraw such amount from the Collection
Account and pay such amount to the Servicer. Following receipt from the Issuer
of the Servicer's statement and the written instructions set forth in the
preceding sentence, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall withdraw such amount from the Collection
Account and pay such amount to such Servicer. The Issuer agrees that if any such
monies, instruments, cash or other proceeds shall be received by the Issuer in
an account other than the Collection Account or in any other manner, such
monies, instruments, cash and other proceeds will not be commingled by the
Issuer with any of its other funds or property, if any, but will be held
separate and apart therefrom and shall be held in trust by the Issuer for, and
immediately paid over to, but in any event within two Business Days from
receipt, the Indenture Trustee with any necessary endorsement. All monies,
instruments, cash and other proceeds received by the Indenture Trustee pursuant
to this Base Indenture shall be immediately deposited in the Collection Account
within two Business Days from receipt and shall be applied as provided in this
Article 5.

         (b) Disqualification of Institution Maintaining Collection Account.
Upon and after the establishment of a new Collection Account as an Eligible
Deposit Account pursuant to Section 5.2(a), the Issuer shall deposit or cause to
be deposited all Collections as set forth in Section 5.3(a) into the new
Collection Account, and in no such event shall deposit or cause to be deposited
any Collections thereafter into any account established, held or maintained with
the institution formerly maintaining the Collection Account (unless it later
becomes a Qualified Institution maintaining the Collection Account as an
Eligible Deposit Account).

         Section 5.4. Determination of Interest. Interest with respect to each
Series of Notes shall be determined, allocated and distributed in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the applicable Series Supplement.

         Section 5.5. Determination of Principal. Principal with respect to each
Series of Notes shall be determined, allocated and distributed in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the applicable Series Supplement. However, all
principal or interest with respect to any Series of Notes shall be due and
payable no later than the Final Scheduled Payment Date with respect to such
Series.

         Section 5.6. Paired Series. To the extent provided in a Series
Supplement, any Series of Notes may be paired with one or more other Series
(each, a "Paired Series"). Each Paired Series may be prefunded with an initial
deposit to a pre-funding account in an amount up to the initial principal
balance of such Paired Series, primarily from the proceeds of the sale of such
Paired Series, or will have a variable principal amount. Any such pre-funding
account will be held for the benefit of such Paired Series and not for the
benefit of the Noteholders of the Series paired therewith. As funds are

not later than the Business Day prior to the Fee Remittance Date following the
date on which such funds were so invested, except for any Eligible Investment
held in the Capitalized Interest Account (including any administrative
subaccounts thereof) which is in an investment made by the Paying Agent
institution, in which event such investment may mature on such Fee Remittance
Date, so long as such funds shall be available for withdrawal on or prior to

property on deposit from time to time in the Reserve Account and the proceeds
thereof for the benefit of the Secured Parties. The Reserve Account shall be
under the sole dominion and control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of

shall be available for withdrawal on or prior to such applicable Fee Remittance
Date. All income or other gains from the investment of moneys deposited in the

aggregate amount due to such class of Noteholders) of the aggregate amount
available to be distributed in respect of the Notes of such Series.

         Section 6.2. Optional Repurchase of Notes. The Issuer may repurchase a

limited partnership action.

         (c) Compliance with Laws and Contracts. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Issuer of this Base Indenture, the Notes and the other
Related Documents (other than any Related Document relating solely to a
Segregated Series) to which the Issuer is a party do not and will not (i)
violate, in any material respect, any provision of any law, rule, regulation,
order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award to which the
Issuer or its property is subject, or of the limited partnership agreement and
certificate of limited partnership of the Issuer; (ii) result in a material
breach of or constitute a material default under the provisions of any
indenture, loan or credit agreement or any other material agreement, lease or
instrument to which the Issuer may be or is subject or by which it, or its
property, is bound; or (iii) result in, or require, the creation or imposition
of any Lien on or with respect of any of the material properties of the Issuer
other than the Lien in favor of the Indenture Trustee provided herein; and the
Issuer is not in violation of, or in default under, any such law, rule,
regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award or
any such indenture, agreement, lease or instrument except for violations or
defaults that singly or in the aggregate have not had nor would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Issuer.

         (d) Governmental Approvals. The Issuer has obtained all authorizations,
consents, approvals, exemptions of or filings or registrations with all
governmental commissions, regulatory bodies, boards, bureaus, agencies and

investigation at law or in equity or before or by any court, public board or
body pending or, to the knowledge of the Issuer, overtly threatened in writing

Report, Student Loan Schedule, Alternative Loan Schedule and computer tape)

General Partner of the limited partnership agreement of the Issuer and the
transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action.

<PAGE>


         (a) Due Organization. It is a national banking association duly
organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the United

         Section 7.5. Reassignment upon Breach. The Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, shall inform the other parties to this Indenture
and the Noteholders promptly, in writing, upon the discovery of any breach of
the representations and warranties made by the Issuer pursuant to Sections
7.1(g), (l) or (m) or any of the covenants of the Issuer made pursuant to
Section 8.3 that materially and adversely affects the interest of the
Noteholders in any Financed Student Loan (any such breach that does not affect
any Student Loan Guarantor's) obligation to guarantee payment of such Financed
Student Loan shall not be considered to have a material adverse effect and, if
pursuant to a Series Supplement the Noteholders have an interest in the
Alternative Loan Guarantor's obligation to guarantee payment of such Financed
Student Loan, any breach that does not affect any Alternative Loan Guarantor's
obligation to guarantee payment of such Financed Student Loan shall not be
considered to have a material adverse effect). Unless any such breach which
materially and adversely (subject to the preceding parenthetical) affects the
interests of the Noteholders, shall have been cured within 30 days following the
discovery thereof by the Issuer or receipt by the Issuer of written notice from
the Indenture Trustee of such breach, the Financed Student Loan as to which such
representation and warranty or covenant relates shall be released from the
Collateral and reassigned (a) in the case of a Student Loan to the Eligible
Lender Trustee, and (b) in the case of an Alternative Loan to the Seller (each,
a "Reassignment"), as of the first Determination Date succeeding the end of such
30 day period. In consideration of and as a precondition to the reassignment of
such Financed Student Loan, the Issuer shall deposit to the Collection Account
on such Determination Date immediately available funds equal to the Purchase
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing the Issuer may, at its option in lieu of depositing
such Purchase Amount to the Collection Account on such date, cause, as the case
may be, either (i) the Eligible Lender Trustee to pledge to the Indenture
Trustee on such date for inclusion in the Collateral a new Eligible Student Loan
in substitution for such Student Loan which was a Financed Student Loan, such
new Eligible Student Loan to have a Principal Balance plus accrued and unpaid
interest at least equal to the Substitution Amount of the Student Loan for which
it is being substituted and bearing an interest rate that is the maximum allowed
by law for the related student loan program, by delivering an updated Student
Loan Schedule to the Indenture Trustee reflecting such substitution or (ii) the
Issuer to pledge to the Indenture Trustee on such date for inclusion in the
Collateral a new Eligible Alternative Loan in substitution for such Alternative
Loan, such new Alternative Loan to have a Principal Balance plus accrued and
unpaid interest at least equal to the Substitution Amount of the Alternative
Loan for which it is being substituted and, if applicable, bearing an interest
rate that is the maximum allowed by law for the related student loan program, by
delivering an updated Alternative Loan


                                       33




<PAGE>


Schedule to the Indenture Trustee reflecting such substitution (in either case,
a "Substitution"). The Indenture Trustee shall execute such documents reasonably
requested by the Issuer in order to effect such reassignment and to release the
Indenture Trustee's Lien thereunder. The sole remedy of the Indenture Trustee or
the Noteholders with respect to a breach of representations and warranties
pursuant to Sections 7.1(g), (l) and (m) and the covenants contained in Section
8.3 shall be to require the Issuer to deposit the Purchase Amount or substitute
Financed Student Loans as provided above.

the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent holds on that date money designated
for and sufficient to pay all principal and interest then due. Amounts properly
withheld under the Code by any Person from a payment to any Noteholder of
interest and/or principal shall be considered as having been paid by the Issuer

Notes and this Base Indenture may be served, and where, at any time when the
Issuer is obligated to make a payment of principal and premium upon the Notes,
the Notes may be surrendered for payment. The Issuer will give prompt written
notice to the Indenture Trustee of the location, and any change in the location,
of such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any
such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Indenture Trustee

         The Issuer will cause each Paying Agent other than the Indenture
Trustee to execute and deliver to the Indenture Trustee and each Enhancement
Provider, if any, an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the
Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby
so agrees), subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent
will:

         (i) hold all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with
respect to the Notes in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided and pay such sums to such Persons as herein provided;

         (ii) give the Indenture Trustee and each Enhancement Provider, if any,
notice of any default by the Issuer of which it has actual knowledge (or any
other obligor upon the Notes) in the making of any payment required to be made
with respect to the Notes;

         (iii) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Indenture Trustee, forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee
all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent;

         (iv) immediately resign as a Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the
Indenture Trustee all sums held by it in trust for the payment of Notes if at
any time it ceases to meet the standards required to be met by a Paying Agent at
the time of its appointment; and

         (v) comply with all requirements of the Code with respect to the
withholding from any payments made by it on any Notes of any applicable
withholding taxes imposed thereon and with respect to any applicable reporting
requirements in connection therewith.

         The Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer
Order direct any Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in
trust by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee upon
the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held by such Paying Agent; and
upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Indenture Trustee, such Paying
Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.

         Subject to applicable laws with respect to escheat of funds, any money
held by the Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of
any amount due with respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such amount has become due and payable shall be discharged from such trust
and be paid to either (i) the Issuer on Issuer Request and with the prior
written consent of the applicable Enhancement Provider, if so specified in the
applicable Series Supplement, or (ii) if so specified in the applicable Series
Supplement, the applicable Enhancement Provider, if and to the extent such money
or any portion thereof was paid by such Enhancement


                                       35




<PAGE>


Provider, if any, to the Indenture Trustee for payment of interest on or
principal of the Notes; and the Noteholder thereof shall thereafter, as an
unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof (but
only to the extent of the amounts so paid to the Issuer), and all liability of
the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money
shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee or such
Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the
expense and direction of the Issuer cause to be published once, in a newspaper
published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day
and of general circulation in The City of New York, notice that such money
remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be
less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of
such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee
shall also adopt and employ, at the expense of the Issuer, any other reasonable
means of notification of such repayment (including mailing notice of such
repayment to Noteholders whose Notes have been called but have not been
surrendered for redemption or whose right to or interest in monies due and
payable but not claimed is determinable from the records of the Indenture
Trustee or of any Paying Agent, at the last address of record for each such
Noteholder).

         Section 8.3. Existence. The Issuer will keep in full effect its
existence, rights and franchises as a limited partnership under the laws of the
State of Delaware (unless, subject to the prior written consent of each
Enhancement Provider, if specified in the applicable Series Supplement, it
becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is or becomes, organized under the
laws of any other State or of the United States of America, in which case the
Issuer will keep in full effect its existence, rights and franchises under the
laws of such other jurisdiction) and will obtain and preserve its qualification
to do business in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is or shall be
necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the
Notes, the Collateral and each other instrument or agreement included in the
Indenture Trust Estate. The Issuer will maintain its status as a pass-through
entity for federal income tax purposes.

         Section 8.4. Protection of Indenture Trust Estate. (a) The Issuer will
from time to time execute or authenticate and deliver a Supplement hereto and
all such financing statements, continuation or amendment statements, instruments
of further assurance and other instruments, and will take such other action
necessary or advisable to:

         (i) maintain or preserve the lien and security interest of this
Indenture or carry out more effectively the purposes hereof;

         (ii) perfect, publish notice of or protect the validity of any Grant
made or to be made by this Indenture;

         (iii) collect payments due on the Financed Student Loans; or

         (iv) preserve and defend title to the Indenture Trust Estate and the
rights of the Indenture Trustee and the Secured Parties in such Indenture Trust
Estate

                                       36


<PAGE>


against the claims of all persons and parties. It shall be the responsibility of
the Issuer to prepare such instruments.

The Issuer hereby designates the Indenture Trustee its agent and
attorney-in-fact to, if it fails to do so itself, execute or authenticate any
financing statement, continuation or amendment statement or other instrument
required to be executed, authenticated or filed pursuant to this Section.

         (b) Opinions as to Indenture Trust Estate. On each Series Closing Date,
the Issuer shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee and each Enhancement Provider,
if any, an Opinion of Counsel either stating that, in the opinion of such
counsel, such action has been taken with respect to the recording and filing of
this Indenture, any Series Supplement, and any other requisite documents, and
with respect to the execution and filing of any financing statements and
continuation statements, as are necessary to perfect and make effective the lien
and security interest of this Indenture and reciting the details of such action,
or stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, no such action is necessary to
make such lien and security interest effective.

         Section 8.5. Performance of Obligations. (a) The Issuer will not take
any action and will use its best efforts not to permit any action to be taken by
others (if such action is within the Issuer's control) that would release any
Person from any of such Person's material covenants or obligations under any
instrument or agreement included in the Indenture Trust Estate or that would
result in the amendment, hypothecation, subordination, termination or discharge
of, or impair the validity or effectiveness of, any such instrument or
agreement, except as expressly provided in this Indenture, each Series
Supplement, each Purchase and Contribution Agreement, the Servicing Agreement or
such other instrument or agreement.

         (b) The Issuer may contract with other Persons to assist it in
performing its duties under this Indenture and each Series Supplement, and any
performance of such duties by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee and
in an Officer's Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be action taken by
the Issuer. Initially, the Issuer has contracted with the Servicer to assist the
Issuer in performing its duties under this Indenture.

         (c) If the Issuer shall have knowledge of the occurrence of a Servicer
Default, the Issuer shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee and the Rating
Agencies, and shall specify in such notice the action, if any, the Issuer is
taking with respect to such default. If a Servicer Default shall arise from the
failure of the Servicer to perform any of its duties or obligations under the
Servicing Agreement with respect to the Financed Student Loans, the Issuer shall
take all reasonable steps available to it to enforce its rights under the
Related Documents in respect of such failure and shall take all reasonable steps
available to it to enforce its rights in respect of such failure at the
direction of the Indenture Trustee or the Requisite Investors.



                                       37

         (d) Upon any termination of the Servicer's rights and powers pursuant
to any Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall promptly notify the Indenture
Trustee and each Enhancement Provider, if any. As soon as a successor Servicer
is appointed the Issuer shall notify the Indenture Trustee and each Enhancement
Provider, if any, of such appointment, specifying in such notice the name and
address of such successor Servicer.

         (e) Without derogating from the absolute nature of the assignment
granted to the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture or the rights of the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, the Issuer agrees that it will not, without the
prior written consent of the Indenture Trustee and each Enhancement Provider, if
specified in the applicable Series Supplement, amend, modify, waive, supplement,
terminate or surrender, or agree to any amendment, modification, supplement,
termination, waiver or surrender of, the terms of any Collateral or the Related
Documents, except to the extent otherwise provided in the Servicing Agreement,
or waive timely performance or observance by the Servicer, AMS, the Issuer or
the Eligible Lender Trustee under a material provision of any Purchase and
Contribution Agreement, or the Servicing Agreement; provided, however, that no
such amendment shall (i) increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or
accelerate or delay the timing of, distributions that are required to be made
for the benefit of the Noteholders, (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the
Notes which are required to consent to any such amendment, without the consent
of the Noteholders of all the outstanding Notes of the applicable Series, or
(iii) result in a deemed exchange of Notes for new notes under Section 1001 of
the Code. If any such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver shall be so
consented to, the Issuer agrees, promptly following a request by the Indenture
Trustee or any Enhancement Provider, if specified in the applicable Series
Supplement, to do so, to execute and deliver, in its own name and at its own
expense, such agreements, instruments, consents and other documents as the
Indenture Trustee or each Enhancement Provider, if specified in the applicable
Series Supplement, may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.

         (f) The Issuer shall maintain and implement administrative and
operating procedures (including, without limitation, an ability to recreate
records identifying and evidencing the Financed Student Loans in the event of
the destruction of the originals thereof), and keep and maintain, or cause to be
kept and maintained, all documents, books, records and other information
reasonably necessary or advisable for the collection of all the Financed Student
Loans (including, without limitation, records adequate to permit the daily
identification of each new Financed Student Loan included in the Collateral from
time to time and all Collections of and adjustments to each existing Financed
Student Loan).

         (g) At its expense, the Issuer shall timely and fully perform and
comply, and cause the Eligible Lender Trustee to perform and comply, with all
material provisions, covenants and other promises required to be observed by
each of them under the Higher Education Act, all Student Loan Notes, all the
Student Loan Guaranty Agreements, each applicable Alternative Loan program, all
Alternative Loan Notes, all the Alternative Loan Guaranty Agreements, the
Servicing Agreement and other agreements to which the Issuer is a party related
to the Collateral.

         (h) The Issuer shall administer, operate and maintain, or cause the

other amounts due with respect to such Financed Student Loan, including all
Subsidy Payments, and all Student Loan Guaranty Payments under the applicable
Student Loan Guaranty Agreement and all Alternative Loan Guaranty Payments under
the applicable Alternative Loan Guaranty Agreement, except for such deferments
and forbearance permitted with respect to either Student Loans under the Higher
Education Act or Alternative Loans, and (ii) enter and, where applicable, cause
the Eligible Lender Trustee to enter, into Student Loan Guaranty Agreements so
that all Student Loans are covered thereby and enter into the Servicing
Agreement so that all Financed Student Loans are covered thereby.

         Section 8.6. Reporting Requirements of the Issuer. The Issuer shall
furnish the reports required to be furnished by the Issuer, as described in
Article 4 of this Base Indenture and in the manner set forth in such Article.

Payments or Alternative Loan Guaranty Payments, as applicable, or would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Issuer.

Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee by
the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate Note Principal Amount of all Series
of Notes then outstanding; provided, however, that if any Series of Notes shall
limit the voting rights with respect to such Series to certain classes during
certain times, only the classes with then-current voting rights will be taken
into consideration, and provided, further, that if the Issuer demonstrates that
it is making a good-faith attempt to cure such breach, such 45 day period may be
extended by the Indenture Trustee) to 90 days; or

         (f) the filing of a decree or order for relief by a court having

or similar official of the Issuer or for any substantial part of the Indenture

applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, or the consent by the Issuer to the entry of an order for

Supplement as an "Event of Default."

         Section 9.2. Rights of the Indenture Trustee upon Events of Default.
(a) Acceleration of Maturity; Recision and Annulment. If and whenever an Event
of Default specified in Section 9.1 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h) or (i) should
occur and be continuing with respect to a Series of Notes (other than a
Segregated Series), the Indenture Trustee may and, at the written direction of
the Requisite Investors shall


                                       45




<PAGE>


declare all the Notes of each Series (other than a Segregated Series) to be
immediately due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Issuer and upon any
such declaration the unpaid principal amount of such Notes of each Series (other
than a Segregated Series), together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon
through the date of acceleration shall become immediately due and payable. If
and whenever an Event of Default specified in Section 9.1 (f) or (g) should
occur and be continuing with respect to a Shared Collateral Series, the Notes of
all Shared Collateral Series shall be immediately due and payable without notice
or action by any person. If and whenever an Event of Default should occur and be
continuing with respect to a Segregated Series of Notes, the Indenture Trustee
may and, at the written direction of the Required Noteholders with respect to
such Segregated Series of Notes shall, declare all the Notes with respect to
such Segregated Series to be immediately due and payable, by a notice in writing
to the Issuer and upon any such declaration the unpaid principal amount of such
Segregated Series of Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon
through the date of acceleration shall become immediately due and payable. The
Indenture Trustee shall provide each Rating Agency with written notice of any
acceleration of maturity of the Notes. At any time after such declaration of
acceleration of maturity has been made and before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee as
hereinafter provided in this Article IX, the Requisite Investors (if such
acceleration of maturity relates to all outstanding Series of Notes other than a
Segregated Series) or the Required Noteholders for the applicable Series (if
such acceleration of maturity relates to a Segregated Series of Notes) may
rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

         (i) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Indenture Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay:

                  (A) all payments of principal of and interest on (1) all Notes
         of each Series (if such Event of Default occurred with respect a Series
         of Notes other than a Segregated Series) or (2) all Notes of the
         applicable Segregated Series (if such Event of Default occurred with
         respect to a Segregated Series), and all other amounts that would then
         be due hereunder or upon such Notes if the Event of Default giving rise
         to such acceleration had not occurred; and

                  (B) all sums paid or advanced by the Indenture Trustee
         hereunder plus all amounts owed to each Enhancement Provider, if any,
         under the Related Documents and the reasonable compensation, expenses,
         disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee and its agents and
         counsel; and

         (ii) all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal
of the Notes that have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured
or waived as provided in Section 9.11.



                                       46


<PAGE>


         No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any
right consequent thereto.

         (b) Related Documents. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing with respect to (i) a non-Segregated Series of Notes, the
Indenture Trustee shall exercise, to the extent necessary, all rights, remedies,
powers, privileges and claims of the Issuer against any party under or in
connection with applicable law and the Related Documents for each Series which
is a non-Segregated Series of Notes, including the right or power to take any
action to compel performance or observance by any such party of its obligations
to the Issuer, and to give any consent, request, notice, direction, approval,
extension or waiver in respect of the Related Documents for each Series which is
a non-Segregated Series of Notes; or (ii) a Segregated Series of Notes, the
Indenture Trustee shall exercise, to the extent necessary, all rights, remedies,
powers, privileges and claims of the Issuer against any party under or in
connection with the applicable law and the Related Documents for such Segregated
Series, including the right or power to take any action to compel performance or
observance by any such party of its obligations to the Issuer, and to give any
consent, request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver in respect of
the Related Documents for such Segregated Series. If so specified in the
applicable Series Supplement, the Indenture Trustee may agree to limit its
exercise of rights and remedies available to it as a result of the occurrence of
an Event of Default to the extent set forth therein.

         (c) [Reserved].

         (d) Certain Other Non-Segregated Series. Certain Series of Notes (not
including any Segregated Series of Notes) may provide for allocations of
Collections to such Series of Notes only in respect of specified items of
Collateral upon the occurrence of certain Events of Default. Upon the occurrence
of such an Event of Default relating to such a Series of Notes, the Indenture
Trustee shall, to the extent specified in the applicable Series Supplement,
limit any recourse hereunder to the related specified items of Collateral to
satisfy the payment of all interest and principal on such Series of Notes up to
the Note Principal Amount of such Series.

         (e) Segregated Series. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
relating to any outstanding Segregated Series of Notes, the Indenture Trustee
shall limit any recourse hereunder to the related Series-Specific Collateral in
satisfying the payment of interest and principal due on such Segregated Series
of Notes.

         Section 9.3. Other Remedies. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Base Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
Indenture Trustee may pursue any remedy available under applicable law or in
equity to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Notes (or the
applicable Segregated Series of Notes, in the case of an Event of Default that
affects only one or more particular Segregated Series of Notes) or to enforce
the performance of any provision of each Series of Notes, this Base Indenture or
any Series Supplement with respect to each Series of Notes. In addition, the
Indenture Trustee may, or shall at the written direction of the Requisite
Investors (or the

                                       47


<PAGE>

Required Noteholders of one or more Segregated Series of Notes, in the case of
an Event of Default that affects only such Segregated Series of Notes), direct
the Issuer to exercise any rights or remedies available under any Related
Document or under applicable law or in equity with respect to each Series of
Notes or to do one or more of the following (subject to the provisions of this
Base Indenture and any Series Supplement):

         (i) institute Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust for the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes or under this
Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any
judgment obtained, and collect from the Issuer and any other obligor upon such
Notes monies adjudged due;

         (ii) institute Proceedings from time to time for the complete or
partial foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Indenture Trust
Estate;

         (iii) exercise any remedies of a secured party under the UCC and take
any other appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of
the Indenture Trustee, each Enhancement Provider, if any, and the Noteholders;
and

         (iv) sell the Indenture Trust Estate or any portion thereof or rights
or interests therein, at one or more public or private sales called and
conducted in any manner permitted by law;

provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee may not sell or otherwise
liquidate the Indenture Trust Estate following an Event of Default, unless (A)
the Noteholders holding 100% of the Note Principal Amount for each outstanding
Shared Collateral Series of Notes consents (or the Noteholders holding 100% of
the Note Principal Amount for each applicable Segregated Series of Notes, in the
case of an Event of Default that affects only one or more particular Segregated
Series of Notes, consents); (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation
distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to discharge in full all amounts
then due and unpaid upon such Notes for principal and interest (as evidenced by
a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee) or (C) the
Indenture Trustee determines that the Indenture Trust Estate will not continue
to provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on the
Notes as they would have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and
payable, and the Indenture Trustee obtains the consent of the Supermajority
Investors (or the consent of the Required Noteholders of each applicable
Segregated Series of Notes in the case of an Event of Default that affects only
one or more particular Segregated Series of Notes). In determining such
sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C), the Indenture
Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an Independent
investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Indenture
Trust Estate for such purpose.

         (b) The Indenture Trustee may maintain a Proceeding even if it does not
possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding, and
any such Proceeding instituted by the Indenture Trustee shall be in its own name
as Indenture Trustee. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by
law.

         Section 9.4. Optional Preservation of the Indenture Trust Estate. If
the Notes have been declared to be due and payable under Section 9.1 following
an Event of Default and such declaration and its consequences have not been
rescinded and annulled, the Indenture Trustee may elect to maintain possession
of the Indenture Trust Estate. It is the desire of the parties hereto and the
Noteholders that there be at all times sufficient funds for the payment of
principal of and interest (including any Noteholders' Interest Basis Carryover)
on the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take such desire into account when
determining whether to maintain possession of the Indenture Trust Estate. In
determining whether to maintain possession of the Indenture Trust Estate, the
Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion (which
shall be obtained at the expense of the Issuer) of an Independent investment
banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such
proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Indenture Trust Estate for such
purpose.

         Section 9.5. Limitation on Suits. Any other provision of this Base
Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, a Noteholder may pursue a remedy with
respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if:

         (a) The Noteholder gives to the Indenture Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to such Noteholder;

         (b) The Requisite Investors (or the Required Noteholders of one or more
Segregated Series of Notes if one or more Segregated Series of Notes is
affected) make a written request to the Indenture Trustee to pursue the remedy;

         (c) Such Noteholder or Noteholders offer and, if requested, provide to
the Indenture Trustee reasonable indemnity against any loss, liability or
expense;

         (d) The Indenture Trustee does not comply with the request within 60
days after receipt of the request; and

         (e) During such 60-day period the Requisite Investors (or the Required
Noteholders of one or more Segregated Series of Notes if one or more Segregated
Series of Notes is affected) do not give the Indenture Trustee a direction
inconsistent with the request.

A Noteholder may not use this Base Indenture to prejudice the rights of another
Noteholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Noteholder.

         Section 9.6. Unconditional Rights of Holders to Receive Payment;
Withholding Taxes. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Base
Indenture, the right of any Noteholder of a Note to receive payment of principal
and interest on the Note (except for any Noteholders' Interest Basis Carryover),
on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note, or to bring suit for
the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the
consent of the Noteholder.


                                       49




<PAGE>

         (b) The Paying Agent shall (or if the Indenture Trustee is not the
Paying Agent, the Indenture Trustee shall cause the Paying Agent to execute and
deliver to the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall
agree with the Indenture Trustee that such Paying Agent shall) comply with all
requirements of the Code regarding the withholding of payments in respect of
Federal income taxes due from Noteholders and otherwise comply with the
provisions of this Base Indenture applicable to it.

         Section 9.7. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Indenture
Trustee, or any Noteholder, has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right
or remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason or has been determined adversely to the Indenture
Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in
such Proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former
positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been
instituted.

         Section 9.8. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. No right or remedy herein
conferred upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the holders of Notes
is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right or
remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to
every other right and remedy given under this Base Indenture or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy under this Base Indenture, or otherwise, shall not prevent the
concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

         Section 9.9. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the
Indenture Trustee or of any holder of any Note to exercise any right or remedy
accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.
Every right and remedy given by this Article 9 or by law to the Indenture
Trustee or to the holders of Notes may be exercised from time to time, and as
often as may be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the holders of
Notes, as the case may be.

         Section 9.10. Control by Requisite Investors or Required Noteholders.
The Requisite Investors (or to the extent such remedy relates only to a
particular Segregated Series of Notes, the Required Noteholders) may direct the
time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to
the Indenture Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Indenture Trustee. However, (a) subject to Section 10.1, the Indenture Trustee
may refuse to follow any direction that it determines might involve it in
liability, conflicts with law or this Base Indenture, or that the Indenture
Trustee determines might materially adversely affect the rights of any
Noteholders not consenting to such action, (b) subject to the express terms of
Section 9.3, any direction to sell or liquidate the Indenture Trust Estate shall
be by the Noteholders holding 100% of the aggregate Note Principal Amount of all
Series of Notes; provided,

                                       50




<PAGE>


however, that if any Series of Notes shall limit the voting rights with respect
to such Series to certain classes during certain times, only the classes with
then-current voting rights will be taken into consideration and (c) if the
conditions set forth in Section 9.4 have been satisfied and the Indenture
Trustee elects to retain the Indenture Trust Estate pursuant to such Section,
then any direction to the Indenture Trustee by Noteholders holding less than
100% of the aggregate Note Principal Amount for all Series of Notes; provided,
however, that if any Series of Notes shall limit the voting rights with respect
to such Series to certain classes during certain times, only the classes with
then-current voting rights will be taken into consideration, to sell or
liquidate the Indenture Trust Estate shall be of no force or effect.

         Section 9.11. Waiver of Past Events. Subject to Section 12.2 hereof,
the Requisite Investors (or the Required Noteholders of a Segregated Series of
Notes if only a Segregated Series of Notes has been affected), by notice to the
Indenture Trustee, may waive any existing Potential Event of Default or Event of
Default, except that (a) any Potential Event of Default or Event of Default
arising out of an Event of Bankruptcy with respect to the Issuer or (b) any
Potential Event of Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal
of or interest on any Note of such Series may only be waived by the Noteholders
holding 100% of the Note Principal Amount of each Series of Notes. Upon any such
waiver pursuant to this Section 9.4, such Potential Event of Default or Event of
Default shall cease to exist with respect to all (but not less than all) Series,
and any Potential Event of Default or Event of Default with respect to all (but
not less than all) Series arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured
for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Potential Event of Default or Event of Default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

         Section 9.12. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by
Indenture Trustee.

         (a) The Issuer covenants that if (i) default is made in the payment of
any interest (including any Noteholders' Interest Basis Carryover or interest
thereon) on any Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such default
continues for a period of two days, or (ii) default is made in the payment of
the remaining principal balance of any Notes when the same becomes due and
payable on the applicable Final Scheduled Payment Date, or (iii) default for
five days or more is made in the payment of any installment of the principal of
any Notes when the same becomes due and payable and when available funds are
sufficient to make such payment, the Issuer shall, upon demand of the Indenture
Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Noteholders, the whole amount then
due and payable on such Notes for principal and interest (and any Noteholders'
Interest Basis Carryover), with interest upon the overdue principal, and, to the
extent payment at such rate of interest shall be legally enforceable, upon
overdue installments of interest (and any Noteholders' Interest Basis Carryover
together with interest thereon), at the rate specified in the applicable Series
Supplement and in addition thereto such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee and
its respective agents and counsel.

                                       51




<PAGE>



         (b) In case the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon
such demand, the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust, may (and with the prior written consent of the Requisite Investors,
shall) institute a Proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid,
and may prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce
the same against the Issuer or other obligor upon such Notes and collect in the
manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon
such Notes, wherever situated, the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable, in
each case subject to Section 13.17 of this Base Indenture.

         (c) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture
Trustee may, in its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce its rights and
the rights of the Noteholders, by such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture
Trustee shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any such rights,
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the
applicable Related Document or in aid of the exercise of any power granted
herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable right vested
in the Indenture Trustee by the applicable Related Document or by law, in each
case subject to Section 13.17 of this Base Indenture.

         (d) In case there shall be pending, relative to the Issuer or any other
obligor upon the Notes or any Person having or claiming an ownership interest in
the Indenture Trust Estate, Proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code
or any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization,
liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or
taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor or Person,
or in case of any other comparable judicial Proceeding relative to the Issuer or
other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or
such other obligor, the Indenture Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal
of any Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Indenture Trustee shall
have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be
entitled and empowered, and shall, at the written direction of the Requisite
Investors, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:

         (i) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of
principal and interest (including any Noteholders' Interest Basis Carryover and
interest thereon) owing and unpaid in respect of any Notes and to file such
other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Indenture Trustee (including any claim for reasonable compensation
to the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee, and their
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses
and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Indenture Trustee and
each predecessor Indenture Trustee, except as a result of negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith) and of the Noteholders allowed in such Proceeding;



                                       52




<PAGE>


         (ii) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on
behalf of the Noteholders in any election of a trustee, a standby trustee or
Person performing similar functions in any such Proceeding;

         (iii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute all amounts received with
respect to the claims of the Noteholders and the Indenture Trustee on their
behalf; and

         (iv) to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may
be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Indenture Trustee
or the Noteholders allowed in any judicial Proceeding relative to the Issuer,
its creditors and its property;

         and any trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar
official in any such Proceeding is hereby authorized by each of such Noteholders
to make payments to the Indenture Trustee, and, in the event that the Indenture
Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to such Noteholders, to
pay to the Indenture Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover
reasonable compensation to the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture
Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other
expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Indenture
Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee except as a result of negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith.

         (e) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Indenture
Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Noteholder thereof or to
authorize the Indenture Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any
Noteholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election
of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar Person.

         (f) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture,
or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Indenture Trustee without the
possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other
Proceeding relative thereto, and any such action or Proceeding instituted by the
Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express
trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the expenses,
disbursements and compensation of the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor
Indenture Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the
benefit of the Noteholders.

         (g) In any Proceeding brought by the Indenture Trustee (and also any
Proceeding involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to
which the Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall be
held to represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be necessary to make any
Noteholder a party to any such Proceeding.

         Section 9.13. The Indenture Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The
Indenture Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Indenture Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee, its agents and
counsel) and the Noteholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the
Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property, and
shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or
other property payable or deliverable on any such claim and any custodian in any
such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Noteholder to make such
payments to the Indenture Trustee and, in the event that the Indenture Trustee
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholders, to pay
the Indenture Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee, its agents and
counsel, and any other amounts due the Indenture Trustee under Section 10.2
hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee, its agents and counsel, and
any other amounts due the Indenture Trustee under Section 10.2 hereof out of the
estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the
same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all
distributions, dividends, money, notes and other properties which the
Noteholders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether
in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Indenture Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan

Trust Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer. Any money or property
collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in accordance with this Base

                              THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

         Section 10.1. Acceptance of the Trusts. The Indenture Trustee accepts
and agrees to execute the trusts granted to it by this Indenture, but only upon
the terms and conditions set forth herein. The Indenture Trustee undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Base Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Base Indenture against the Indenture Trustee.

         In case an Event of Default has occurred of which the Indenture Trustee
has, or is deemed to have, notice in accordance with this Indenture and has not
been cured, the Indenture Trustee agrees to act in accordance with the
instructions and orders of the Requisite Investors, but in any such event, only
upon and subject to the following expressed terms and conditions:

         (a) The Indenture Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
hereof and perform any of its duties by or through attorneys, agents, receivers,
employees or co-trustees and shall not be answerable for the conduct of the same
if appointed in accordance with the standards set forth herein, and shall be
entitled to an Opinion of Counsel or advice of counsel concerning all matters of
trusts hereof and the duties hereunder, and may in all cases pay such reasonable
compensation to all such attorneys, agents, receivers, and employees as may
reasonably be employed in connection with the trusts hereof. The Indenture
Trustee may act upon an Opinion of Counsel or the opinion or advice of an
attorney or accountant rendered by it in the exercise of reasonable care. The
Indenture Trustee shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from
any action or nonaction of such Person which is in good faith and in reliance
upon such opinion or advice. The Indenture Trustee shall not be responsible for
any action or inaction of the Servicer or any party hereto except as provided
herein or under applicable laws, rules and regulations.


                                       57


<PAGE>

         (b) The Indenture Trustee shall not be responsible for any recital
herein, or in any Note, or for the validity of the execution by the Issuer or
the other parties of this Indenture or the other Related Documents, or of any
Supplement or instruments of further assurance, or for the sufficiency of the
security for the Notes issued hereunder or intended to be secured hereby, or for
the value or title of the property herein conveyed or otherwise as to the
maintenance of the security hereof.

         (c) The Indenture Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or
application by the Issuer of the Notes or the proceeds thereof or for the use or
application of any money paid over by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with
the provisions of this Indenture or for the use and application of other money
received by the Indenture Trustee.

         (d) The Indenture Trustee shall be protected in acting upon any notice,
requisition, request, consent, certificate, order, opinion, affidavit, letter,
telegram or other paper or document reasonably believed to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons. Any
action taken by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture upon the
request or authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making such
request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of a Note shall be
conclusive and binding upon all future owners of the Notes and upon any Notes
issued in exchange therefor or in place thereof.

         (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Indenture, as to the
existence or nonexistence of any fact or as to the sufficiency or validity of
any instrument, paper or proceeding, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to
rely upon a certificate of an officer of any Noteholder as sufficient evidence
of facts therein contained, and prior to the occurrence of a default of which
the Indenture Trustee has been notified as provided in subsection (g) of this
Section 10.1, or of which by said subsection it is deemed to have notice, and
shall also be at liberty to accept a dealing, transaction or action as necessary
or expedient, but may at its discretion secure such further evidence deemed
necessary or advisable, but shall in no case be bound to secure the same.

         (f) The permissive right of the Indenture Trustee to do things
enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty and the Indenture
Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its negligence or willful
misconduct; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable
for any error of judgment made in good faith, unless it shall be proved that
such Person was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.

         (g) The Indenture Trustee shall not be required to take notice or be
deemed to have notice of any default hereunder except failure by the Issuer to
cause to be made any of the payments to it for the account of the Noteholders
required to be made by Section 8.1, or defaults under Section 9.1, unless the
Indenture Trustee shall be specifically notified in writing of such default by
the Issuer or a Noteholder.

         (h) The Indenture Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or
surety in respect of the execution of the said trusts and powers or otherwise in
respect of the premises.

         (i) No provision of this Base Indenture shall require the Indenture
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise
of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk
or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

         (j) All moneys received by the Indenture Trustee shall, until used or
applied or invested as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for
which they were received in the respective account.

         (k) Whether or not herein expressly so provided, every provision of
this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Indenture Trustee shall be subject to the provisions
of this Section.

         (l) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS INDENTURE OR THE OTHER
RELATED DOCUMENTS, NOTHING IN THIS INDENTURE OR THE OTHER RELATED DOCUMENTS
SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE TO
THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION OR A FEDERAL GUARANTOR FOR ANY VIOLATIONS OF
STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH RESPECT TO STUDENT
LOANS HELD BY THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE PURSUANT TO, OR TO OTHERWISE COMPLY WITH ITS
OBLIGATIONS UNDER, THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OR IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.

         Section 10.2. [Reserved].

         Section 10.3. Notice if Default Occurs. If a default occurs of which
the Indenture Trustee is by Section 10.1(g) required to take notice or if notice
of default be given as provided in said Section 10.1(g), then the Indenture
Trustee shall give written notice thereof by registered or certified mail to the
Issuer and the Noteholders.

         Section 10.4. Intervention by Indenture Trustee. In any judicial
proceeding to which the Issuer is a party, the Indenture Trustee shall intervene
if directed to do so in writing by the Requisite Investors.

         Section 10.5. Successors. Any corporation or association into which the
Indenture Trustee may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer its corporate trust business
and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any corporation or
association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or
transfer to which it is a party, ipso facto, shall be and become successor
Indenture Trustee hereunder and vested with all of the title to


                                       59



<PAGE>

the whole property or trust estate and all the trusts, powers, discretions,
immunities, privileges and all other matters as was its predecessor, without the
execution or filing of any instrument or any further act, deed or conveyance on
the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

         Section 10.6. Resignation. The Indenture Trustee may at any time resign
from the trusts hereby created by giving 90 days' written notice to the Issuer,
each Enhancement Provider, if any, and the Noteholders, and such resignation
shall take effect at the end of such 90 days, or upon the earlier appointment
and acceptance of a successor Indenture Trustee, as provided in Section 10.8
hereof, or removal as provided in Section 10.7 hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, resignation of the Indenture Trustee shall not be effective until a
successor or temporary Indenture Trustee is appointed and has accepted such
appointment; provided, however, if an instrument of acceptance shall not have
been delivered within 120 days after giving such notice of resignation, the
resigning Indenture Trustee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for
the appointment of a successor, and any attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in
connection with such petition shall be payable by the Issuer.

         Section 10.7. Removal. The Indenture Trustee may be removed by each
Enhancement Provider, if specified in the applicable Series Supplement, or the
Requisite Investors at any time with the consent of each Enhancement Provider,
if specified in the applicable Series Supplement, by an instrument in writing
delivered to the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer shall remove the Indenture
Trustee if (i) the Indenture Trustee fails to comply with Section 10.13, (ii) an
Event of Bankruptcy occurs with respect to the Indenture Trustee, (iii) a
receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Indenture Trustee or its
property or (iv) the Indenture Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, removal of the Indenture Trustee shall not be
effective until a successor is appointed and has accepted such appointment.

         Section 10.8. Appointment of Successor. In case the Indenture Trustee
shall resign or be removed, or be dissolved, or shall be in course of
dissolution or liquidation, or otherwise become incapable of acting hereunder,
or in case it shall be taken under the control of any public officer or
officers, or of a receiver appointed by a court, a successor meeting the
eligibility requirements of Section 10.13 may be appointed by the Issuer by an
instrument in writing signed by the Issuer. The Issuer shall also inform the
Rating Agencies promptly of any such resignation or removal of the Indenture
Trustee. If no appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee shall have been made
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section within 120 days after the
Indenture Trustee shall have given written notice as provided in Section 10.6
hereof, the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer or the Requisite Investors may apply
to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Indenture Trustee.
Each such successor Indenture Trustee shall agree in writing to be bound by the
provisions of Section 13.16.

         Section 10.9. Concerning Any Successor. Every successor Indenture
Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to its
predecessor and also to the Issuer an instrument in writing accepting such
appointment hereunder, and


                                       60


<PAGE>


thereupon such successor, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become fully vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts,
duties and obligations of its predecessor; but such predecessor shall,
nevertheless, upon receipt of a request from the Issuer execute and deliver an
instrument transferring to such successor all the estates, properties, rights,
powers and trusts of such predecessor hereunder; and every predecessor shall
deliver all securities and moneys held by it as Indenture Trustee hereunder to
its successor.

         Section 10.10. Appointment of Co-Indenture Trustee or Separate
Indenture Trustee. (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Base
Indenture or any Series Supplement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any
legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Collateral may
at the time be located, the Indenture Trustee shall have the power and may
execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more persons to act as a
co-trustee or co-trustees, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or
any part of the Collateral, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such
capacity and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, such title to the
Collateral, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this
Section 10.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the
Indenture Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. No co-trustee or separate
trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a
successor Indenture Trustee under Section 10.8 and no notice to Noteholders of
the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required under
Section 10.6. No co-trustee shall be appointed without the consent of the Issuer
unless such appointment is required as a matter of state law or to enable the
Indenture Trustee to perform its functions hereunder.

         (b) Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and
conditions:

         (i) The Notes of each Series shall be authenticated and delivered
solely by the Indenture Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the
Indenture Trustee;

         (ii) All rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
upon the Indenture Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
performed by the Indenture Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee
jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not
authorized to act separately without the Indenture Trustee joining in such act),
except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any
particular act or acts are to be performed, the Indenture Trustee shall be
incompetent or unqualified to perform, such act or acts, in which event such
rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the
Assets or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and
performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the
direction of the Indenture Trustee;

         (iii) No trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any
act or omission of any other trustee hereunder;


                                       61


<PAGE>

         (iv) The Indenture Trustee may at any time accept the resignation of or
remove any separate trustee or co-trustee; and

         (v) The Indenture Trustee shall remain primarily liable for the actions
of any co-trustee.

         (c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Indenture Trustee
shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-
trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Indenture and
the conditions of this Article 10. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon
its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the
Indenture Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the
provisions of this Base Indenture and any Series Supplement, specifically
including every provision of this Base Indenture or any Series Supplement
relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection
to, the Indenture Trustee. Every such instrument shall be filed with the
Indenture Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Issuer.

         (d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time constitute the
Indenture Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority,
to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect to
this Base Indenture or any Series Supplement on its behalf and in its name. If
any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign
or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall
vest in and be exercised by the Indenture Trustee, to the extent permitted by
law, without the appointment of a new or successor Indenture Trustee.

         (e) In connection with the appointment of a co-trustee, the Indenture
Trustee may, at any time, at the Indenture Trustee's sole cost and expense,
without notice to the Noteholders, delegate its duties under this Base Indenture
and any Series Supplement to any Person who agrees to conduct such duties in
accordance with the terms hereof; provided, however, that no such delegation
shall relieve the Indenture Trustee of its obligations and responsibilities
hereunder with respect to any such delegated duties.

         Section 10.11. Successor Indenture Trustee as Trustee of Funds. In the
event of a change of the Indenture Trustee the predecessor which has resigned or
been removed shall cease to be trustee of any funds then held by it hereunder
and the successor Indenture Trustee shall become such trustee.

         Section 10.12. Indemnification. (a) The Indenture Trustee shall not be
under any obligation or duty to perform any act at the request of the
Noteholders or the Issuer or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof
or to exercise any remedy hereunder unless properly indemnified to its
satisfaction subject to Section 10.1(i) hereof, except making payment of
principal and interest or accelerating the Notes as provided


                                       62

<PAGE>


herein. The Indenture Trustee shall not be required to take notice, or be deemed
to have knowledge, of any default of the Issuer, except as provided in Section
10.1(g).

         (b) The Issuer agrees to indemnify the Indenture Trustee for, and to
hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred without negligence or bad faith or
willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the
costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in
connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties
hereunder except as a result of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on
its part and except any liability to the DOE on account of the Indenture
Trustee's status as such.

         Section 10.13. Eligibility Requirements for Indenture Trustee. The
Indenture Trustee and any successor Indenture Trustee shall at all times be (i)
an institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (ii) a
corporation or national bank or national banking association organized and doing
business under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof,
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined
capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or
examination by federal and state authority, (iii) an institution whose long-term
senior unsecured debt is rated at least "Ba2", in the case of Moody's, or
"BBB-", in the case of Fitch, Inc. (or in the case of each Rating Agency, such
lower rating as is confirmed by such Rating Agency in writing would not
adversely affect any of the ratings then assigned to the Notes), and (iv)
unaffiliated with the Issuer or AMS. If such corporation, national bank or
national banking association publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining
authority, then, for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and
surplus of such corporation, national bank or national banking association shall
be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report or condition so published. If at any time the Indenture Trustee shall
cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the
Indenture Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
specified in Section 10.6. No person shall become a successor trustee hereunder
if the succession of such Person would result in the qualification, downgrading
and withdrawal of any of the ratings then assigned by the Ratings Agencies to
the Notes.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                           DISCHARGE OF BASE INDENTURE

         Section 11.1. Termination of the Issuer's Obligations. (a) This Base
Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except that the Issuer's
obligations under Section 10.2 and Section 10.12 and the Indenture Trustee's and
Paying Agent's obligations under Section 11.3 shall survive) when all

         (b) In addition, except as may be provided to the contrary in any
Series Supplement, the Issuer may terminate all of its obligations under this
Base Indenture if:

         (i) the Issuer irrevocably deposits in trust with the Indenture Trustee
or at the option of the Indenture Trustee, with a trustee reasonably
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer under the terms of an
irrevocable trust agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee, money or U.S. Government Obligations in an amount sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the
Indenture Trustee, to pay, when due, principal and interest on the Notes to
maturity or redemption, as the case may be, and to pay all other sums payable by
it hereunder; provided, however, that (1) the Indenture Trustee of the
irrevocable trust shall have been irrevocably instructed to pay such money or
the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to the Indenture Trustee and
(2) the Indenture Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such
money or the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to the payment of said
principal and interest with respect to the Notes;

         (ii) the Issuer delivers to the Indenture Trustee an Officer's
Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge
of this Base Indenture have been complied with, and an Opinion of Counsel to the
same effect;

         (iii) the Issuer delivers to the Indenture Trustee an Officer's
Certificate stating that no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default, in
either case, described in Section 9.1 shall have occurred and be continuing on
the date of such deposit; and

         (iv) the Rating Agency Confirmation Condition is satisfied with respect
to each outstanding Series of Notes.

         Then, this Base Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except
as provided in this Section 11.1), and the Indenture Trustee, on written demand
of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging confirmation of
and discharge under this Base Indenture.

         (c) After such irrevocable deposit made pursuant to Section 11.1(b) and
satisfaction of the other conditions set forth herein, the Indenture Trustee
promptly upon request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Issuer's
obligations under this Base Indenture except for those surviving obligations
specified above.

         In order to have money available on a payment date to pay principal or
interest on the Notes, the U.S. Government Obligations shall be payable as to
principal or interest at least one Business Day before such payment date in such
amounts as will provide the necessary money. U.S. Government Obligations shall
not be callable at the Issuer's option.

         Section 11.2. Application of Trust Money. The Indenture Trustee or a
trustee satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer shall hold in trust
money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to Section 11.1.
The Indenture Trustee shall apply the deposited money and the money from U.S.
Government Obligations in accordance with this Base Indenture to the payment of
principal and interest on the Notes.

         The provisions of this Section 11.2 shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Base Indenture.

         Section 11.3. Repayment to the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee and the
Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuer upon written request any excess
money or, pursuant to Section 2.11 and Section 2.14, return any Notes held by
them at any time.

         Subject to Section 2.7(c), the Indenture Trustee and the Paying Agent
shall pay to the Issuer upon written request any money held by them for the
payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years after the
date upon which such payment shall have become due.

         The provisions of this Section 11.3 shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Base Indenture.

                                   AMENDMENTS

         Section 12.1. Without Consent of the Noteholders. Without the consent
of any Noteholder, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, and any applicable
Enhancement Provider, if any, at any time and from time to time, may enter into
one or more Supplements hereto, in form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee,
for any of the following purposes, provided that the Rating Agency Confirmation
Condition with respect to each outstanding Series of Notes is met with respect
to such Supplement:

         (a) to create a new Series of Notes (including, without limitation,
making such modifications to the Base Indenture and the other Related Documents
as may be required to issue a Segregated Series of Notes; provided, however,
that the creation of any Segregated Series of Notes shall not result in a
material adverse effect on the Noteholders of any Series unless the Required
Noteholders of such Series shall have given their prior written consent to the
creation thereof);

         (b) to add to the covenants of the Issuer for the benefit of any
Secured Parties (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than
all Series of Notes, stating that such covenants are expressly being included
solely for the benefit of such Series) or to surrender any right or power herein
conferred upon the Issuer;




                                       65


<PAGE>


         (c) to mortgage, pledge, convey, assign and transfer to the Indenture
Trustee any property or assets as security for the Notes and to specify the
terms and conditions upon which such property or assets are to be held and dealt
with by the Indenture Trustee and to set forth such other provisions in respect
thereof as may be required by the Indenture or as may, consistent with the
provisions of the Base Indenture, be deemed appropriate by the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee, or to correct or amplify the description of any such property
or assets at any time so mortgaged, pledged, conveyed and transferred to the
Indenture Trustee (including amending or modifying the Alternative Loan Schedule
or Student Loan Schedule);

         (d) to cure any mistake, ambiguity, defect, or inconsistency or to
correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any Series
Supplement;

         (e) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to certificated

         (f) to add to or change any of the provisions of the Base Indenture to
such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of Notes
in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or
without interest coupons;

         (g) to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be
inconsistent with any other provision herein or to make any other provisions
with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture;

         (h) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder
by a successor Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes of one or more Series
and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Indenture Trustee;

         (i) to add to the covenants and agreements contained herein or in any
Related Document for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; or

         (j) to add such provisions with respect to matters or questions arising
hereunder or under any Related Document as may be necessary or desirable and not
inconsistent with the Related Documents;

         provided, however, that, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel, such
         action shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests
         of any Noteholders. Upon the request of the Issuer and upon receipt by
         the Indenture Trustee of the documents described in Section 2.2 hereof,
         the Indenture Trustee shall join with the Issuer in the execution of
         any Series Supplement authorized or permitted by the terms of this Base
         Indenture and shall make any further appropriate agreements and
         stipulations which may be therein contained, but the Indenture Trustee
         shall not be obligated to enter into such Series Supplement which
         affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Base Indenture
         or otherwise.

         Section 12.2. With Consent of the Noteholders. Except as provided in
Sections 9.11 and Section 12.1, the provisions of this Base Indenture and any
Series Supplement (unless otherwise provided in such Series Supplement) and each
other Related Document to which the Issuer is a party may from time to time be
amended, modified or waived, if such amendment, modification or waiver is in
writing and consented to in writing by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, any
applicable Enhancement Provider (if such consent rights of an Enhancement
Provider are specified in the applicable Series Supplement) and the Required
Noteholders of each outstanding Series of Notes; provided that, if such
amendment, modification or waiver of or to this Base Indenture, the Series
Supplement with respect to a Series of Notes or any Related Document does not
adversely affect in any material respect the Noteholders of a particular Series
of Notes (as substantiated by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect), then the
consent of the Noteholders of such Series shall not be required to such
amendment, modification or waiver; and provided further, that the Rating Agency
Confirmation Condition is satisfied with respect to each affected Series of
Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

         (i) any modification of this Section 12.1, any change in any
requirement hereunder that any particular action be taken by Noteholders holding
the relevant percentage in principal amount of the Notes or any change in the
definition of the terms "Note Principal Amount", "Required Noteholders",
"Supermajority Investors" or "Requisite Investors" or the applicable amount of
Enhancement, if any, or any defined term used for the purpose of any such
definitions shall require the consent of each affected Noteholder; and

         (ii) any amendment, waiver or other modification that would (a) extend
the due date for, or reduce the amount of any scheduled repayment or prepayment
of principal of or interest on any Note (or reduce the principal amount of or
rate of interest on any Note) shall require the consent of each affected
Noteholder; (b) approve the assignment or transfer by the Issuer of any of its
rights or obligations hereunder or under any other Related Document to which it
is a party except pursuant to the express terms hereof or thereof shall require
the consent of each affected Noteholder; (c) release any obligor under any
Related Document to which it is a party except pursuant to the express terms of
such Related Document shall require the consent of each affected Noteholder; (d)
affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of any Noteholder
individually in comparison to any other Noteholder shall require the consent of
such Noteholder; or (e) amend or otherwise modify any Event of Default shall
require the consent of each affected Noteholder.

No failure or delay on the part of any Noteholder or the Indenture Trustee in
exercising any power or right under this Base Indenture or any other Related
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other power or right.

         Section 12.3. Supplements. Each amendment or other modification to this
Base Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a Supplement. The initial
effectiveness of each Supplement shall be subject to the satisfaction of the
Rating Agency Confirmation Condition with respect to such Supplement. In
addition to the manner provided in Sections 12.1 and 12.2, each Series
Supplement may be amended as provided in such Series Supplement.

         Section 12.4. Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment or
waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Noteholder of a Note is a
continuing consent by the Noteholder and every subsequent Noteholder of a Note
or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Noteholder's
Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such
Noteholder or subsequent Noteholder may revoke the consent as to his Note or
portion of a Note if the Indenture Trustee receives written notice of revocation
before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective. An amendment or
waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every
Noteholder. The Issuer may fix a record date for determining which Noteholders
must consent to such amendment or waiver.

         Section 12.5. Notation on or Exchange of Notes. The Indenture Trustee
may place an appropriate notation about an amendment or waiver on any Note
thereafter authenticated. The Issuer in exchange for all Notes may issue and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment or
waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not
affect the validity and effect of such amendment or waiver.

         Section 12.6. The Indenture Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc. The
Indenture Trustee shall sign any Supplement authorized pursuant to this Article
12 if the Supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities
or immunities of the Indenture Trustee. If it does have such an adverse effect,
the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, sign it. In signing such Supplement,
the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive, if requested, an indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive and, subject to Section 10.1, shall
be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel as conclusive evidence that such Supplement is authorized or permitted
by this Base Indenture and that it will be valid and binding upon the Issuer in
accordance with its terms.

         Section 12.7. Amendments of Certain Defined Terms. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Article 12, the following defined terms (each of which
is defined in Schedule I to this Base Indenture) may be amended upon
satisfaction of the Rating Agency Confirmation Condition and without any further
action or consent of any kind: "Additional Financed Student Loans"; Alternative
Loan"; Alternative Loan Guarantors"; "Borrower"; "Defaulted Alternative Loan";
"Defaulted Student Loan"; "Deferment Status"; "Eligible Alternative Loan";
"Eligible Student Loan"; "Forbearance Status"; "Initial Financed Student Loans";
"Realized Losses"; and "Student Loan."

         The Issuer or the Indenture Trustee or the Eligible Lender Trustee by
notice to the other may designate additional or different addresses for
subsequent notices or communications; provided, however, the Issuer may not at
any time designate more than a total of three (3) addresses to which notices
must be sent in order to be effective.

         Any notice (i) given in person shall be deemed delivered on the date of
delivery of such notice, (ii) given by first class mail shall be deemed given
five (5) days after the date that such notice is mailed, (iii) delivered by
telex or telecopier shall be deemed given on the date of delivery of such

         Notwithstanding any provisions of this Base Indenture to the contrary,
the Indenture Trustee shall have no liability based upon or arising from the
failure to receive any notice required by or relating to this Base Indenture or
the Notes.




                                       69

         If the Issuer mails a notice or communication to Noteholders, it shall
mail a copy to the Indenture Trustee at the same time.

         (b) Where the Base Indenture provides for notice to Noteholders of any
event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if sent in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid,
to each Noteholder affected by such event, at its address as it appears in the
Note Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest
date, prescribed (if any) for the giving of such notice. In any case where
notice to Noteholder is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice,
nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Noteholder shall
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Noteholders, and any
notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively
presumed to have been duly given. Where this Base Indenture provides for notice
in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by any Person entitled to
receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be
the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed
with the Indenture Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent
to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

         In the case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by
reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail,
then such notification as shall be made that is satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

         Section 13.2. Communication by Noteholders With Other Noteholders.
Noteholders may communicate with other Noteholders with respect to their rights
under this Base Indenture or the Notes.

         Section 13.3. Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent. Upon
any request or application by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee to take any
action under this Base Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Indenture
Trustee an Officer's Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Indenture Trustee (which shall include the statements set forth in
Section 13.4) stating that, in the opinion of the signers, all conditions
precedent and covenants, if any, provided for in this Base Indenture relating to
the proposed action have been complied with.

         Section 13.4. Statements Required in Certificate. Each certificate with
respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Base
Indenture shall include:

         (a) a statement that the Person giving such certificate has read such
covenant or condition;

         (b) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or
investigation upon which the statements contained in such certificate are based;

         (c) a statement that, in the opinion of such Person, he has made such
examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an
informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been
complied with; and

         (d) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such Person,
such condition or covenant has been complied with.

         Section 13.5. Rules by the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee may
make reasonable rules for action by or at a meeting of Noteholders.

         Section 13.6. No Recourse Against Others. A director, Authorized
Officer, employee or stockholder of the Issuer, as such, shall not have any
liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or this Base
Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such
obligations or their creation. Each Noteholder by accepting a Note waives and
releases all such liability.

         Section 13.7. Duplicate Originals. The parties may sign any number of
copies of this Base Indenture. One signed copy is enough to prove this Base
Indenture.

         Section 13.8. Benefits of Base Indenture. Except as set forth in a
Series Supplement, nothing in this Base Indenture or in the Notes, expressed or
implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their
successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under the Base Indenture.

         Section 13.9. [Reserved].

         Section 13.10. Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF

HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION

THE TIME FOR NOTICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER ADDRESS OF WHICH IT
SHALL HAVE GIVEN WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC NOTICE TO THE OTHER PARTIES. THE
FOREGOING SHALL NOT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO BRING SUIT IN THE
COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.

         THE ISSUER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS INDENTURE, ANY
OTHER RELATED DOCUMENT OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED
OR WHICH MAY BE IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR ARISING
FROM ANY BANKING OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
INDENTURE OR ANY OTHER RELATED DOCUMENT AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT A JURY TRIAL.

         Section 13.11. Successors. All agreements of the Issuer in this Base
Indenture and the Notes shall bind its successor; provided, however, the Issuer
may not assign its obligations or rights under this Base Indenture or any
Related Document. All agreements of the Indenture Trustee and the Eligible
Lender Trustee in this Base Indenture shall bind its successor.

         Section 13.12. Severability. In case one or more of the provisions
contained in this Indenture shall be or shall be deemed to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. If any provision of this Indenture shall be or shall be deemed
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under the applicable laws and
regulations of one jurisdiction, such provision shall not thereby be rendered
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

         Section 13.13. Counterpart Originals. The parties may sign any number
of copies of this Base Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all
of them together represent the same agreement.

         Section 13.14. Table of Contents, Headings, etc. The Table of Contents,
Cross-Reference Table, and headings of the Articles and Sections of this Base
Indenture have been inserted for convenience of reference only, are not to be
considered a part hereof, and shall in no way modify or restrict any of the
terms or provisions hereof.

         Section 13.15. Termination; Collateral. This Base Indenture, and any
grants, pledges and assignments hereunder, shall become effective concurrently
with the issuance of the first Series of Notes and shall terminate when all the
Issuer Obligations shall have been fully paid and satisfied, at which time the
Indenture Trustee, at the written request of the Issuer and upon receipt of an
Officer's Certificate from the Issuer



                                       72


<PAGE>


to the effect that such condition has been complied with, shall reassign
(without recourse upon, or any warranty whatsoever by, the Indenture Trustee)
and deliver all Collateral and documents then in the custody or possession of
the Indenture Trustee promptly to the Issuer.

         The Issuer and the Secured Parties hereby agree that, if any funds
remain on deposit in the Collection Account after the termination of this Base
Indenture, such amounts shall be released by the Indenture Trustee and paid to
the Issuer.

         Section 13.16. No Bankruptcy Petition Against the Issuer. Each of the
Secured Parties and the Indenture Trustee hereby covenants and agrees that,
prior to the date which is one year and one day after the payment in full of the
latest maturing Note, it will not institute against, or join with any other
Person in instituting against, the Issuer any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings, under
any Federal or state bankruptcy or similar law; provided, however, that nothing
in this Section 13.16 shall constitute a waiver of any right to indemnification,
reimbursement or other payment from the Issuer pursuant to this Base Indenture.
In the event that any such Secured Party or the Indenture Trustee takes action
in violation of this Section 13.16, the Issuer shall file an answer with the
bankruptcy court or otherwise properly contesting the filing of such a petition
by any such Secured Party or the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or the
commencement of such action and raising the defense that such Secured Party or
the Indenture Trustee has agreed in writing not to take such action and should
be estopped and precluded therefrom and such other defenses, if any, as its
counsel advises that it may assert. The provisions of this Section 13.16 shall
survive the termination of this Base Indenture, and the resignation or removal
of the Indenture Trustee. Nothing contained herein shall preclude participation
by any Secured Party or the Indenture Trustee in the assertion or defense of its
claims in any such proceeding involving the Issuer.

         Section 13.17. No Recourse; Limitation of Obligations. No recourse
under or with respect to any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer as
contained in this Base Indenture or any of the other Related Documents or any
other agreement, instrument or document to which the Issuer is a party shall be
had against any incorporator, stockholder, Affiliate, officer, employee or
director of the Issuer by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute or otherwise; it being expressly
agreed and understood that the agreements of the Issuer contained in this Base
Indenture and all other agreements, instruments and documents entered into
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith are, in each case, solely limited
partnership obligations of the Issuer.

         (a) Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Base Indenture to
the contrary, the Issuer shall not, and shall not be obligated to, pay any fees,
costs, indemnified amounts or expenses due pursuant to this Base Indenture other
than in accordance with the order of priorities set out in the related Series
Supplement. Any amount which the Issuer does not pay pursuant to the operation
