<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5.1. Nature of Transaction.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The parties hereto intend that unless assigned by the Lessor in accordance with the
terms of the Operative Documents, or Applicable Law otherwise provides, legal title to the Property shall remain in the Lessor as security for the obligations of the Lessee hereunder and under the
other Operative Documents until the Lessee has fulfilled all of its obligations hereunder and under the other Operative Documents. The Lessee hereby grants to the Lessor a continuing Lien and security
interest in the Property to secure the payment of all sums due hereunder and under the other Operative Documents. The parties hereto intend that for state, real estate and commercial law and
bankruptcy purposes, (i) the Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement and (ii) the Lessor and the Purchasers will be deemed lenders making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to the sum of
the Lessor Amounts and the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, which amounts are secured by the Properties. The parties hereto covenant to treat the Notes (and interests therein) and the Lessor
Amount as indebtedness of the Lessee for U.S. federal, state and local tax purposes and further covenant that they will not take any action inconsistent with such treatment (unless either (i) required
to do so by the United States Internal Revenue Service or the equivalent taxing authority of any foreign government or any U.S. state or political subdivision thereof (a </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>"Taxation Authority"</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) or (ii) an
alternative position of a Taxation Authority is asserted, and such party reasonably believes, on advice of counsel,
that there is a reasonable basis for such asserted position). Nevertheless, the Lessee acknowledges and agrees that neither the Lessor, the Indenture Trustee, the Arranger nor any of the
Purchasers has provided, or will provide, any tax, accounting, or legal advice to the Lessee regarding the Operative Documents or the transaction contemplated thereby, and that the Lessee has obtained
and relied upon such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it deems appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
without limiting the generality of clause (a) of this Section 5.1, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the event of any insolvency or receivership
proceedings or a petition under the United States bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the
Lessee, the Lessee Guarantor, the Lessor or the Purchasers or any collection actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative Documents shall be regarded as loans made by the Lessor and the
Purchasers as unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee. The parties hereto covenant and agree that (except to the extent provided for in section 5.1(a) above) they will not take any action or
advocate any position contrary to the intentions set forth in this Article V. </FONT></P>

of the Lessee, the Lessor and the Purchasers that: (i) the amount and timing of installments of Basic Rent due and payable from time to time from the Lessee under the Lease shall be equal to the
aggregate payments due and payable as interest on the Notes and Yield on the Lessor Amounts on each Scheduled Payment Date; (ii) if the Lessee elects the Purchase Option with respect to all or (as
permitted hereunder) any part of the Property or the Lessee becomes obligated to purchase all of the Property under the Lease, the Notes, the Lessor Amounts, and all interest, Yield, Make-Whole
