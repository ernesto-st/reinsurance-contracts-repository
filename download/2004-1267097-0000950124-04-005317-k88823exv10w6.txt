definition to reflect such changed rating system or the non-availability of

or cessation.

(b) the effects of purchase accounting.

            SECTION 1.02. Terms Generally. The definitions set forth or referred
to in Section 1.01 shall apply equally to both the singular and plural forms of
the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The words "include",
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without
limitation". All references herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules
shall be deemed references to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits and
Schedules to, this Agreement unless the context shall otherwise require. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, any reference in this Agreement to any
Loan Document shall mean such document as amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature shall be construed in
accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; provided that, if the U.S.
Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the U.S. Borrower requests an
amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change
occurring after the Closing Date in GAAP or in the application thereof on the
operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the U.S.
Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof
for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or
after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision
shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately
before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been
withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith. For the purposes of
determining compliance with Section 6.01 through Section 6.10 with respect to
any amount in a currency other than Dollars, amounts shall be deemed to equal
the Dollar Equivalent thereof determined using the Exchange Rate calculated as
of the Business Day on which such amounts were incurred or expended, as
applicable.

            SECTION 1.03. Exchange Rates. (a) Not later than 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, on each Calculation Date, the Administrative Agent shall (i)
determine the Exchange Rate as of such Calculation Date and (ii) give notice
thereof to the Borrowers. The Exchange Rates so determined shall become
effective on the first Business Day immediately following the relevant
Calculation Date (a "Reset Date") or other date of determination, shall remain
effective until the next succeeding Reset Date, and shall for all purposes of
this Agreement (other

                                                                              73

than any other provision expressly requiring the use of an Exchange Rate
calculated as of a specified date) be the Exchange Rates employed in converting
any amounts between Dollars and each of the Foreign Currencies.

               (b) Not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Reset
Date, the Administrative Agent shall (i) determine the aggregate amount of the
Dollar Equivalents of the principal amounts of the Loans denominated in Foreign
Currencies then outstanding (after giving effect to any Loans denominated in
Foreign Currencies made or repaid on such date) and the Revolving L/C Exposure
and (ii) notify the Lenders, each Issuing Bank and the Borrowers of the results
of such determination.

            SECTION 1.04. Redenomination of Certain Foreign Currencies. (a) Each
obligation of any party to this Agreement to make a payment denominated in the
national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the
Euro as its lawful currency after the Closing Date shall be redenominated into
Euro at the time of such adoption (in accordance with the EMU Legislation). If,
in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of
interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be
inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London Interbank Market for
the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis
shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on
which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if
any Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately
prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such
Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

               (b) Without prejudice and in addition to any method of conversion
or rounding prescribed by any EMU Legislation and (i) without limiting the
liability of any Borrower for any amount due under this Agreement and (ii)
without increasing any Commitment of any Lender, all references in this
Agreement to minimum amounts (or integral multiples thereof) denominated in the
national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the
Euro as its lawful currency after the Closing Date shall, immediately upon such
adoption, be replaced by references to such minimum amounts (or integral
multiples thereof) as shall be specified herein with respect to Borrowings
denominated in Euros.

               (c) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such
reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to
time specify to be

<PAGE>

                                                                              74

appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the
European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the
Euro.

            SECTION 1.05. Effectuation of Transfers. Each of the representations
and warranties of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings and the Borrowers contained in
this Agreement (and all corresponding definitions) are made after giving effect
to the Restatement Transactions, unless the context otherwise requires.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   The Credits

            SECTION 2.01. Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each Lender agrees (a) to make (i) Global Revolving Facility Loans
denominated in Dollars to the U.S. Borrower from its U.S. Lending Office and
(ii) Global Revolving Facility Loans denominated in Dollars or Foreign
Currencies to Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers from its Global Lending Office, in
the case of clauses (i) and (ii) from time to time during the Availability
Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (A) such
Lender's Global Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding (1) such Lender's
Global Revolving Facility Commitment minus (2) such Lender's Ancillary
Commitment or (B) the Global Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding (1)
the total Global Revolving Facility Commitments minus (2) the total Ancillary
Commitments, and (b) to make U.S. Revolving Facility Loans denominated in
Dollars to the U.S. Borrower from its U.S. Lending Office from time to time
during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not
result in (i) such Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding
such Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Commitment or (ii) the U.S. Revolving
Facility Credit Exposure exceeding the total U.S. Revolving Facility
Commitments. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

            Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the
Third Amendment and Restatement Agreement, each Lender having a Tranche E Term
Loan Commitment made a Tranche E Term Loan to the U.S. Borrower on the
Restatement Effective Date in a principal amount equal to its Tranche E Term
Loan Commitment. All Tranche A-1 Term Loans, Tranche D Term Loans, Revolving
Loans, Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit outstanding under the Existing
Credit Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date

<PAGE>

                                                                              75

shall remain outstanding hereunder on the terms set forth herein. Amounts repaid
in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

            SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan shall be made as
part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans under the same Facility and of the same
Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments
under the applicable Facility (or, in the case of Swingline Loans, in accordance
with their respective Swingline Dollar Commitments or Swingline Foreign Currency
Commitments, as applicable); provided, however, that Global Revolving Facility
Loans under the Global Revolving Facility shall be made by the Global Revolving
Facility Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Available Unused
Commitments on the date such Loans are made hereunder. The failure of any Lender
to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are
several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to
make Loans as required.

                  (b) Subject to Section 2.14, (i) each Borrowing denominated in
Dollars (other than a Swingline Dollar Borrowing) shall be comprised entirely of
ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the applicable Borrower may request in
accordance herewith and (ii) each Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency
(other than a Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing) shall be comprised entirely
of Eurocurrency Loans. Each Swingline Dollar Borrowing shall be an ABR
Borrowing. Each Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing shall be comprised entirely
of Swingline Foreign Currency Loans. Each Lender at its option may make any ABR
Loan or Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate
of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option
shall not affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Lender shall not be
entitled to any amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.21 solely in
respect of increased costs resulting from such exercise.

                  (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount
that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the
Borrowing Minimum; provided that a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing that is an
Ancillary Replacement Borrowing shall be permitted to be in an amount necessary
to finance Ancillary Credit Extensions under an Ancillary Facility being
terminated pursuant to Section 2.22(e). At the time that each ABR Revolving
Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the

<PAGE>

                                                                              76

Borrowing Minimum; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an
aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the U.S.
Revolving Facility Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement
of an L/C Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Each Swingline Dollar
Borrowing and Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing shall be in an amount that is
an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing
Minimum. Borrowings of more than one Type and under more than one Facility may
be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be
more than a total of (i) 10 Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding under each of
the Tranche A-1 Facility, the Tranche D-1 Facility, Tranche D-2 Facility and the
Tranche E Facility and (ii) 35 Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding under each of
the Global Revolving Facility and the U.S. Revolving Facility (not including
Ancillary Replacement Borrowings).

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, Tranche A-1 Maturity Date, Tranche D
Maturity Date or Tranche E Maturity Date, as applicable.

            SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. Except in the case of an
Ancillary Replacement Borrowing (which shall be governed by Section 2.22(e)), to
request a Revolving Borrowing, the applicable Borrower shall notify the
Applicable Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency

finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as contemplated by Section

Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Applicable Agent
and signed by the applicable Borrower. Each such telephonic and written
Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.02:

                  (i) the Borrower requesting such Borrowing;

                  (ii) whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Global
      Revolving Facility Borrowing or a U.S. Revolving Facility Borrowing;

                                                                              77

                  (iii) in the case of a Global Revolving Facility Borrowing
      requested by a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, the Foreign Currency
      in which such Borrowing is to be denominated;

                  (iv) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing
      (expressed in Dollars or the applicable Foreign Currency);

                  (v) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (vi) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars,
      whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency
      Borrowing;

                  (vii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial
      Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
      contemplated by clause (a) of the definition of the term "Interest
      Period"; and

                  (viii) the location and number of the applicable Borrower's
      account to which funds are to be disbursed.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing, unless such Global
Revolving Facility Borrowing (i) is denominated in a Foreign Currency and (ii)
is being requested by a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, in which case such Global
Revolving Facility Borrowing shall be a Eurocurrency Borrowing. If no Interest
Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then
the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of
one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in
accordance with this Section, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender of
the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part
of the requested Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, (i) each Swingline Dollar Lender agrees to make
Swingline Dollar Loans to the U.S. Borrower from time to time during the

<PAGE>

                                                                              78

to the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers from time to time during the Availability
Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not
result in (x) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Swingline Foreign Currency Loans made by such Swingline Foreign
Currency Lender exceeding such Swingline Foreign Currency Lender's Swingline
Foreign Currency Commitment or (y) the sum of the Global Revolving Facility
Credit Exposure and the total Ancillary Commitments exceeding the total Global

required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Dollar
Borrowing or Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing. Within the foregoing limits
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may
borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

                  (b) To request a Swingline Dollar Borrowing or Swingline
Foreign Currency Borrowing, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable

Dollar Lender (in the case of a notice relating to a Swingline Dollar Borrowing)
or each Swingline Foreign Currency Lender (in the case of a notice relating to a
Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing) of any such notice received from a
Borrower and the amount of such Swingline Lender's Swingline Loan to be made as
part of the requested Swingline Dollar Borrowing or Swingline Foreign Currency
Borrowing, as applicable. Each Swingline Dollar Lender shall make each Swingline
Dollar Loan to be made by it hereunder in accordance with Section 2.02(a) on the

Dollar Loans available to the U.S. Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so

2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank). Each Swingline Foreign
Currency Lender shall make each Swingline Foreign Currency Loan to be made by it

Subsidiary Borrower most recently designated to the Applicable Agent.

                  (c) A Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Applicable Agent (and to the other Swingline Dollar Lenders or Swingline Foreign
Currency Lenders, as applicable) not later than 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on any
Business Day require (i) in the case of a Swingline Dollar Lender, the U.S.
Revolving Facility Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all

case of a Swingline Foreign Currency Lender, the Global Revolving Facility
Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of
the outstanding Swingline Foreign Currency Loans made by it. Such notice shall
specify the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loans in which the U.S. Revolving
Facility Lenders or Global Revolving Facility Lenders, as applicable, will

<PAGE>

                                                                              80

provided above, to pay to the Applicable Agent, for the account of the
applicable Swingline Dollar Lender, such U.S. Revolving Facility Lender's U.S.
Revolving Facility Percentage of such Swingline Dollar Loan or Loans. Each
Global Revolving Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees,
upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Applicable Agent, for
the account of the applicable Swingline Foreign Currency Lender, such Global
Revolving Facility Lender's ratable share (based on Available Unused
Commitments) of such Swingline Foreign Currency Loan or Loans. Each Global
Revolving Facility Lender and each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges
and agrees that its respective obligation to acquire participations in Swingline
Foreign Currency Loans and Swingline Dollar Loans, as applicable, pursuant to
this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default
or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each
Revolving Credit Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Credit Lender (and
Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
Lenders), and the Applicable Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable
Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Credit
Lenders. The Applicable Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of any
participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph (c),
and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the
Applicable Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts
received by a Swingline Lender from the applicable Borrower (or other party on
behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by such
Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be
promptly remitted to the Applicable Agent; any such amounts received by the
Applicable Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Applicable Agent to the
Revolving Credit Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
paragraph and to such Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to such Swingline Lender or to
the Applicable Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is
required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. The purchase
of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not
relieve the applicable Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

            SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Each Existing Letter
of Credit is deemed to be a letter of credit issued hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In addition, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, each Borrower may request the issuance of
Dollar Letters of Credit and Foreign Currency Letters of Credit for its own
account, in each case in a form reasonably acceptable

<PAGE>

                                                                              81

to the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the
Availability Period and prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. In the event of any inconsistency between
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any
form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Applicant Party to, or entered into by the Applicant Party with, an Issuing Bank
relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall control.

                  (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain

renewal (other than an automatic renewal in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section) or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Applicant
Party shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication,
if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank)
to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in
advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a
notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter
of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the
date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, (subject to
paragraph (n) of this Section) the currency in which such Letter of Credit is to
be denominated, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
information as shall be necessary to issue, amend, renew or extend such Letter
of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Applicant Party also
shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form
in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall
be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Applicant Party shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the Revolving L/C Exposure shall not exceed
$175,000,000 and (ii) the U.S. Revolving Facility Credit Exposure shall not
exceed the total U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments.

                  (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the

that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit

<PAGE>

                                                                              82

Maturity Date; provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may
provide for the automatic renewal thereof for additional one-year periods
(which, in no event, shall extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) of
this paragraph (c)).

                  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or
an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without
any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the U.S.
Revolving Facility Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each U.S.
Revolving Facility Lender, and each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender hereby
acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such U.S. Revolving Facility Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of
the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each U.S. Revolving Facility
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent in Dollars, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such U.S.
Revolving Facility Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of (i) each L/C
Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in Dollars and (ii) the Dollar
Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as of the date such
payment is required, of each L/C Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in a
Foreign Currency and, in each case, not reimbursed by the U.S. Borrower on the
date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement
payment required to be refunded to the U.S. Borrower for any reason (or, if such
reimbursement payment was refunded in a Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent
thereof determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as of the date of such
refund). Each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of
Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Reimbursement. If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make
any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the U.S. Borrower shall
reimburse such L/C Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount
equal to such L/C Disbursement in Dollars or (subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence) the applicable Foreign Currency, not later than 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the date the U.S.
Borrower receives notice under paragraph (g) of this Section of such L/C
Disbursement, provided

                                                                              83

that in the case of any L/C Disbursement made in Dollars with respect to a
Letter of Credit issued for the account of the U.S. Borrower, the U.S. Borrower
may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in
accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR
Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Dollar Borrowing, as applicable, in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the U.S. Borrower's obligation
to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR
Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Dollar Borrowing. If the U.S. Borrower fails to
reimburse any L/C Disbursement when due, then (i) if such payment relates to a
Foreign Currency Letter of Credit, automatically and with no further action
required, the obligation to reimburse the applicable L/C Disbursement shall be
permanently converted into an obligation to reimburse the Dollar Equivalent,
determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as of the date when such payment
was due, of such L/C Disbursement and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank and each other U.S. Revolving
Facility Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the Dollar Equivalent
thereof (if such L/C Disbursement relates to a Foreign Currency Letter of
Credit), the payment then due from the U.S. Borrower in respect thereof and, in
the case of a U.S. Revolving Facility Lender, such Lender's U.S. Revolving
Facility Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
U.S. Revolving Facility Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars
its U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of the payment then due from the U.S.
Borrower (determined as provided in clause (i) of the immediately preceding
sentence, if such payment relates to a Foreign Currency Letter of Credit), in
the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such
Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders), and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank in Dollars the amounts
so received by it from the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders. Promptly following
receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the U.S. Borrower
pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that U.S. Revolving
Facility Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such
Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may
appear. Any payment made by a U.S. Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement (other than the
funding of an ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Dollar Borrowing as contemplated
above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the U.S. Borrower of
its obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement.

                                                                              84

                  (f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the U.S. Borrower
to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or
provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by
the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a
draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of
setoff against, the U.S. Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related
Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of
such Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse
the applicable Issuing Bank from liability to an Applicant Party to the extent
of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of
which are hereby waived by each Applicant Party to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by such Applicant Party that are caused by (i) such
Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and
other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof
or (ii) such Issuing Bank's refusal to issue a Letter of Credit in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in
the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the
applicable Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised
care in each such determination and each refusal to issue a Letter of Credit. In
furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either

<PAGE>

                                                                              85

accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or
refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not
in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank
shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting
to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, the Applicant Party and the U.S.
Borrower (if the U.S. Borrower is not the Applicant Party) by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank
has made or will make a L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the U.S. Borrower of
its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the U.S. Revolving Facility
Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.

                  (h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C
Disbursement, then, unless the U.S. Borrower shall reimburse such L/C
Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid
amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date
such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the U.S. Borrower
reimburses such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR
Revolving Loans; provided that, if such L/C Disbursement is not reimbursed by
the U.S. Borrower when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then
Section 2.13(d) shall apply; provided, further, that, in the case of a L/C
Disbursement made under a Foreign Currency Letter of Credit, the amount of
interest due with respect thereto shall (i) in the case of any L/C Disbursement
that is reimbursed on or before the date such L/C Disbursement is required to be
reimbursed under paragraph (e) of this Section, (A) be payable in the applicable
Foreign Currency and (B) bear interest at a rate equal to the rate reasonably
determined by the applicable Issuing Bank to be the cost to such Issuing Bank of
funding such L/C Disbursement plus the Applicable Margin applicable to
Eurocurrency Revolving Loans at such time and (ii) in the case of any L/C
Disbursement that is reimbursed after the date such L/C Disbursement is required
to be reimbursed under paragraph (e) of this Section, (A) be payable in Dollars,
(B) accrue interest on the Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange
Rates calculated as of the date such L/C Disbursement was made, of such L/C
Disbursement, (C) bear interest at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR
Revolving Loans and (D) Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant
to this paragraph shall be for

<PAGE>

                                                                              86

the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and
after the date of payment by any U.S. Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the
account of such U.S. Revolving Facility Lender to the extent of such payment.

                  (i) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the U.S. Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the U.S.
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12. From and after the effective date of any
such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and
obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement but shall
not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                  (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, (i) in the case of an Event of Default described in
Section 7.01(h) or (i), on the Business Day or (ii) in the case of any other
Event of Default, on the third Business Day, in each case, following the date on
which the U.S. Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent (or, if
the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders
with Revolving L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total Revolving
L/C Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this
paragraph, the U.S. Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative
Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the
Lenders, an amount in Dollars in cash equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of
such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that (i) the
portion of such amount attributable to undrawn Foreign Currency Letters of
Credit or L/C Disbursements in a Foreign Currency that the U.S. Borrower is not
late in reimbursing pursuant to Section 2.05(e) shall be deposited with the
Administrative Agent in the applicable Foreign Currencies in the actual amounts
of such undrawn Letters of Credit and L/C Disbursements and (ii) upon the

<PAGE>

                                                                              87

occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to a Borrower described in
clause (h) or (i) of Section 7.01, the obligation to deposit such cash
collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become
immediately due and payable in Dollars, without demand or other notice of any
kind. The U.S. Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this
paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11(b). Each such deposit
pursuant to this paragraph or pursuant to Section 2.11(b) shall be held by the
Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent
shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of
withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment
of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
discretion of (i) for so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, the
Administrative Agent and (ii) at any other time, the U.S. Borrower, in each
case, in Permitted Investments and at the risk and expense of the U.S. Borrower,
such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for L/C
Disbursements for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the U.S. Borrower for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time or,
if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total Revolving L/C Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Agreement. If the U.S. Borrower is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the U.S. Borrower within three Business Days
after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the U.S. Borrower is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section
2.11(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned
to the U.S. Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such
return, the U.S. Borrower would remain in compliance with Section 2.11(b) and no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                  (k) Conversion. In the event that the Loans become immediately
due and payable on any date pursuant to Section 7.01, all amounts (i) that the
U.S. Borrower is at such time or thereafter become required to reimburse or
otherwise pay to the Administrative Agent in respect of L/C Disbursements made
under any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit (other than amounts

<PAGE>

                                                                              88

in respect of which the U.S. Borrower has deposited cash collateral pursuant to
Section 2.05(j), if such cash collateral was deposited in the applicable Foreign
Currency to the extent so deposited or applied), (ii) that the U.S. Revolving
Facility Lenders are at the time or thereafter become required to pay to the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent is at the time or thereafter
becomes required to distribute to an Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (e) of
this Section in respect of unreimbursed L/C Disbursements made under any Foreign
Currency Letter of Credit and (iii) that constitute each U.S. Revolving Facility
Lender's participation in any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit under which a
L/C Disbursement has been made, in each case, shall, automatically and with no
further action required, be converted into the Dollar Equivalent, determined
using the Exchange Rates calculated as of such date (or in the case of any L/C
Disbursement made after such date, on the date such L/C Disbursement is made),
of such amounts. On and after such conversion, all amounts accruing and owed to
an Agent, an Issuing Bank or any Lender in respect of the Obligations described
in this paragraph shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rates otherwise
applicable hereunder.

                  (l) Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the U.S.
Borrower may by notice to the Administrative Agent designate up to four Lenders
(in addition to JPMorgan Chase Bank) that agree (in their sole discretion) to
act in such capacity and are reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
as Issuing Banks. Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart
of this Agreement upon the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld) and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank
hereunder for all purposes.

                  (m) Reporting. Unless otherwise requested by the
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the
Administrative Agent (i) on the first Business Day of each week and the first
Business Day of each fiscal quarter, the aggregate face amount of Letters of
Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the last Business Day of the preceding
week or the preceding fiscal quarter, as applicable, (ii) on or prior to each
Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend, renew or extend
any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued,
amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension occurred (and whether the amount
thereof changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes
any L/C Disbursement, the date of such L/C Disbursement and

<PAGE>

                                                                              89

the amount of such L/C Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business Day, such
other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

                  (n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if,
after the Closing Date, any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for an Issuing
Bank to issue Letters of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency, then by
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent
(which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer exist),
such Issuing Bank may declare that Letters of Credit will not thereafter be
issued by it in the affected Foreign Currency or Foreign Currencies, whereupon
the affected Foreign Currency or Foreign Currencies shall be deemed (for the
duration of such declaration) not to constitute a Foreign Currency for purposes
of the issuance of Letters of Credit by such Issuing Bank.

            SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make
each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the
account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose
by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as
provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available
to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in
like funds, to an account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the
Applicable Agent (i) in New York City, in the case of Loans denominated in
Dollars, or (ii) in London, in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign
Currency and designated by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans and Swingline Dollar Borrowings made
to finance the reimbursement of a L/C Disbursement and reimbursements as
provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the applicable Issuing Bank.

                  (b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share
available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Applicable Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding
amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is made

<PAGE>

                                                                              90

available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (x) the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case
of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (y) the rate reasonably determined by
the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of
a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency) or (ii) in the case of the
applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans (in the case of a
Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or the rate reasonably determined by the
Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of a
Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency). If such Lender pays such amount to
the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially
shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the
case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as
specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may
elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type, in the case of Borrowings
denominated in Dollars, or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided
in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with
respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each
such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be
considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline
Foreign Currency Borrowings or Swingline Dollar Borrowings, which may not be
converted or continued.

                  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the
applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by
telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section
2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type and denominated in
the Foreign Currency resulting from such election to be made on the effective
date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be
irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the
Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by
the Applicable Agent and signed by the applicable Borrower.

<PAGE>

                                                                              91

                  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
      applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
      different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
      resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
      pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
      resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
      Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
      Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; provided that the resulting
      Borrowing is required to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the case of a
      Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency; and

                  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing,
      the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
      such election, which shall be a period contemplated by clause (a) of
      the definition of the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.


                  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest
Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of
each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely
Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the
end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is
repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing
shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (unless such Borrowing is denominated in
a Foreign Currency, in which case such Borrowing shall be continued as a
Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration
commencing on the last day of such Interest Period). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
and the

<PAGE>

                                                                              92

Administrative Agent, at the written request (including a request through
electronic means) of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower,
then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing
may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless
repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii)
unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency
shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one
month's duration.

            SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, the Global Revolving Facility Commitments shall terminate
on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the U.S. Revolving Facility
Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. The parties
hereto acknowledge that the Tranche E Term Loan Commitments shall terminate at
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Restatement Effective Date.

                  (b) The U.S. Borrower (on behalf of itself and all Foreign
Subsidiary Borrowers) may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce,
the Commitments under any Facility; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Commitments under any Facility shall be in an amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments) and (ii) the U.S. Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments if, after giving effect to
any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section
2.11, (x) the Global Revolving Facility Credit Exposure plus the total Ancillary
Facility Commitments would exceed the total Global Revolving Facility
Commitments or (y) the U.S. Revolving Facility Credit Exposure would exceed the
total U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments.

                  (c) The U.S. Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of
any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments under
paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the
effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and
the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each notice delivered by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving

facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the U.S. Borrower (by
notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date)
if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the

amount of each U.S. Revolving Facility Loan to the U.S. Borrower on the
Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (ii) to the Applicable Agent for the account of
each Global Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid amount of each Global

unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section
2.10 and (iv) to the Swingline Dollar Lender the then unpaid principal amount of
each Swingline Dollar Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date
and the first date after such Swingline Dollar Loan is made that is the 15th or
last day of a calendar month and is at least five Business Days after such
Swingline Dollar Loan is made; provided that on each date that a U.S. Revolving
Facility Borrowing is made by the U.S. Borrower, the U.S. Borrower shall repay
all Swingline Dollar Loans then outstanding. Each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Applicable Agent for the
account of each Global Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Global Revolving Facility Loan to such Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and (ii) to each Swingline

of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

                  (c) Each Applicable Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Facility and Type
thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of
any principal or

interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount received by such Applicable Agent
hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.


                  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or an Applicable Agent to maintain such accounts or any
error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to
repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced
by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Applicable Agent. Thereafter, the Loans
evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

(e) through (g) of Section 2.10. Not later than the date on which the U.S.
Borrower is required to deliver financial statements with respect to the end of
each Excess Cash Flow Period under Section 5.04(a), the U.S. Borrower will
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate signed by a Financial Officer
of the U.S. Borrower setting forth the amount, if any, of Excess Cash Flow for
such fiscal year and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail.

                  (e) All voluntary prepayments of Tranche D Term Loans effected
on or prior to the first anniversary of the Second Restatement Effective Date
with the proceeds of a substantially concurrent issuance or incurrence of new
term loans under this Agreement, as amended, amended and restated, supplemented,
waived or otherwise modified from time to time (excluding a refinancing of all
the Facilities outstanding under this Agreement in connection with another
transaction not permitted by this Agreement (as determined prior to giving
effect to any amendment or waiver of this Agreement being adopted in connection
with such transaction)), shall be accompanied by a prepayment fee equal to 1.00%
of the aggregate amount of such prepayments if the Applicable Rate (or similar
interest rate spread) applicable to such new term loans is or, upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions, could be less than the Applicable Rate
applicable to the Tranche D Term Loans as of the date hereof.

            SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The U.S. Borrower (on behalf of itself and
the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) agrees to pay to each Lender (other than any

the sum of (a) the daily unused amount of the U.S. Revolving Facility
Commitment, (b) the daily amount of the Available Unused Commitment and (c) the
daily unused amount of the Ancillary Commitment of such Lender during the
preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the Closing Date or ending
with the date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be

                                                                             100

terminated) at a rate equal to (x) 0.75% per annum in respect of each day on
which the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure (excluding the Swingline
Exposures) is less than or equal to 50% of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment
or the Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1.00, (y) 0.50% per annum in

greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and (z) 0.375%, if the Leverage Ratio is less than or
equal to 2.00 to 1.00 (without regard to the Aggregate Revolving Credit

number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. For the purpose of calculating any
Lender's Commitment Fee, the outstanding Swingline Loans during the period for
which such Lender's Commitment Fee is calculated shall be deemed to be zero. The
Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date
and shall cease to accrue on the date on which the last of the Commitments of
such Lender shall be terminated as provided herein.

                  (b) The U.S. Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign
Subsidiary Borrowers) from time to time agrees to pay (i) to each U.S. Revolving
Facility Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the Administrative

December of each year and three Business Days after the date on which the
Revolving Credit Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as provided
herein, a fee (an "L/C Participation Fee") on such Lender's U.S. Revolving
Facility Percentage of the daily aggregate Revolving L/C Exposure (excluding the
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements), during the
preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending
with the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or the date on which the U.S. Revolving
Facility Commitments shall be terminated) at the rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings effective for each day
in such period minus the amount of Issuing Bank Fees (as defined below) set
forth in clause (ii)(x) below and (ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own
account, (x) three Business Days after the last day of March, June, September
and December of each year and three Business Days after the date on which the
U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as
provided herein, a fronting fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by
such Issuing Bank for the period from and including the date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit to and including the termination of such Letter of Credit,
computed at a rate equal to 1/4 of 1% per annum of the daily average stated
amount of such Letter of Credit), plus (y) in connection with the issuance,

                                                                             101

amendment or transfer of any such Letter of Credit or any L/C Disbursement
thereunder, such Issuing Bank's customary documentary and processing charges
(collectively, "Issuing Bank Fees"). All L/C Participation Fees and Issuing Bank
Fees that are payable on a per annum basis shall be computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

                  (c) The U.S. Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent, the fees set forth in the
Administrative Agent Fee Letter dated as of November 15, 2002, as amended,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, at the times
specified therein (the "Administrative Agent Fees").

                  (d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as
appropriate, among the Lenders, except that Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid
directly to the applicable Issuing Banks. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be
refundable under any circumstances.

            SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
(including each Swingline Dollar Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base
Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall
bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for
such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (c) The Swingline Foreign Currency Loans comprising each
Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Swingline
Foreign Currency Rate plus 1.50% per annum plus the Applicable Margin then in
effect for Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by the applicable
Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon
acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as
well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue
principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as
provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any
other amount (x) payable in Dollars, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as
provided in paragraph (a) of this Section or (y) payable in a Foreign Currency,
the rate set forth in clause (i) of this sentence; provided that this paragraph
(d) shall not apply to any Event of

<PAGE>

                                                                             102

Default that has been waived by the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.08.

                  (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
(i) on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of Global
Revolving Facility Loans, upon termination of the Global Revolving Facility
Commitments, (iii) in the case of U.S. Revolving Facility Loans, upon
termination of the U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments, (iv) in the case of the
Tranche A-1 Term Loans, on the Tranche A-1 Maturity Date (v) in the case of the
Tranche D Term Loans, on the Tranche D Maturity Date and (vi) in the case of the
Tranche E Term Loans, on the Tranche E Maturity Date; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

                  (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that (i) interest on Borrowings denominated in Sterling
and (ii) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when
the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate
or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Applicable Agent, and such determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in
any currency:

            (a) the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be
      conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
      not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
      applicable, for such Interest Period; or

            (b) the Applicable Agent is advised by the Required Lenders or the
      Majority Lenders under the Global Revolving Facility that the Adjusted
      LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as

<PAGE>

                                                                             103

      applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
      reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans
      included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Applicable Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such
currency shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to or
continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if
such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, an ABR Borrowing or (B) if such
Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, as a Borrowing bearing interest
at such rate as the Majority Lenders under the Global Revolving Facility and the
applicable Borrower shall agree adequately reflects the costs to the Global
Revolving Facility Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans, and (ii) if any
Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in such currency, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (if such Borrowing is requested to
be made in Dollars) or shall be made as a Borrowing bearing interest at such
rate as the Majority Lenders under the Global Revolving Facility shall agree
adequately reflects the costs to the Global Revolving Facility Lenders of making
the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
      deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
      account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
      requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or those for which payment
      has been requested pursuant to Section 2.21) or Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London
      interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement,
      Eurocurrency Loans or Swingline Foreign Currency Loans made by such Lender
      or any Letter of Credit or participation therein (except those for which
      payment has been requested pursuant to Section 2.21);

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency

<PAGE>

                                                                             104

Loan or Swingline Foreign Currency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to
make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of
participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the
amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable
Borrower (in the case of a Loan) or the U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter
of Credit) will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as
applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change
in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital
of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of
this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held
by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a
level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such
Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the
policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrower (in the case
of a Loan) or the U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter of Credit) shall pay to
such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or
such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth
the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower (in the case of a Loan) or
the U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter of Credit) and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower (in the case of a Loan) or the
U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter of Credit) shall pay such Lender or
Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Promptly after any Lender or any Issuing Bank has
determined that it will make a request for increased compensation pursuant to
this Section 2.15, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall notify the applicable
Borrower thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to

<PAGE>

                                                                             105

demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that
a Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more
than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable,
notifies such Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.

            SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Swingline Foreign Currency
Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto
(including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any
Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency
Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the
assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, such Borrower shall compensate each
Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of
a Eurocurrency Loan or Swingline Foreign Currency Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be the amount determined by such Lender
to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued
on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue a
Eurocurrency Loan, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the
applicable Foreign Currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks
in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount
or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
shall be delivered to such Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. Such Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                                                                             106

            SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of any Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if a
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) any Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank,
as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Agents, each Lender and
each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, Lender or
Issuing Bank, as applicable, on or with respect to any payment by or on account
of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to such Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf, on behalf of another Agent or on behalf of a Lender or an
Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Borrower (with a
copy

<PAGE>

                                                                             107

to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law,
such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law
or reasonably requested by such Borrower as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate.

                  (f) If an Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to
which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which such
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay
over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.17 with
respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent or such Lender and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided that such Borrower, upon the request of
such Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) to such Agent or such Lender in the event such Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
This Section shall not be construed to require any Agent or any Lender to make
available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which
it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other person.

            SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) Unless otherwise specified, each Borrower shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
2.16, 2.17 or 2.21, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Applicable Agent to the applicable account designated to
the U.S. Borrower by each Applicable Agent, except payments to be made directly
to the applicable Issuing Bank or the applicable Swingline Lender as expressly
provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17,
2.21 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto. The
Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, the

<PAGE>

                                                                             108

date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in
the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for
the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of (i) principal or
interest in respect of any Loan shall be made in the currency in which such Loan
is denominated, (ii) reimbursement obligations shall, subject to Sections
2.05(e) and 2.05(k), be made in the currency in which the Letter of Credit in
respect of which such reimbursement obligation exists is denominated or (iii)
any other amount due hereunder or under another Loan Document (other than an
Ancillary Facility Document) shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to
be made by an Applicable Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by
the time required if such Applicable Agent shall, at or before such time, have
taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the
regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by
such Applicable Agent to make such payment. Any amount payable by any Applicable
Agent to one or more Lenders in the national currency of a member state of the
European Union that has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency shall be paid in
Euros.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Applicable Agent from any Borrower to pay fully all amounts of
principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees then due from such
Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of
interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and
unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal
and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Term Loans, Revolving Loans or participations in L/C
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans, Revolving Loans
and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Term Loans, Revolving Loans and participations in L/C
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance

                                                                             109

with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their
respective Term Loans, Revolving Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements
and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased
and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent
of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph
(c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by a Borrower pursuant
to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements to any
assignee or participant, other than to such Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall
apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice
from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Applicable
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder
that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume
that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the
applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount due. In such event, if such
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the
Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or
Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date
such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and
a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount denominated
in Dollars) and (ii) the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to
be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of an amount denominated
in a Foreign Currency).

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d),
then the Applicable Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply

                                                                             110

any amounts thereafter received by the Applicable Agent for the account of such
Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

            SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or 2.21, or if a Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.21, as
applicable, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender in any material respect. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or
2.21, or if a Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or
any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
2.17, or is a Defaulting Lender, then such Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) such Borrower shall have received the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in L/C
Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in
the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or 2.21 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a
reduction in such compensation or payments. Nothing in this

                                                                             111

Section 2.19 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that any Borrower may have
against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender.

            SECTION 2.20. Foreign Subsidiary Loan Parties. On or after the
Closing Date, the U.S. Borrower may designate any Foreign Subsidiary that is a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary as a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Agreement executed by such
Foreign Subsidiary and the U.S. Borrower. Each such designation shall specify
whether such Foreign Subsidiary shall be entitled (i) to make Borrowings under
the Global Revolving Facility and request Letters of Credit under the U.S.
Revolving Facility and/or (ii) to request the creation of Ancillary Facilities
under Section 2.22, and each such designation shall be subject to the consent of
the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld).
Upon the execution by the U.S. Borrower and delivery to the Administrative Agent
of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination with respect to any Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower, such Foreign Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement; provided that no Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower Termination will become effective as to any Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower (other than to terminate such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower's
right to make further Borrowings under this Agreement) at a time when any
principal of or interest on any Loan to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or any
Foreign Currency Letter of Credit for the account of such Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower shall be outstanding hereunder or any Ancillary Facility under which
Ancillary Credit Extensions may be made available to such Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower has not been previously terminated. Promptly following receipt of any
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Agreement or Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
Termination, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each
Revolving Credit Lender. The U.S. Borrower shall be entitled to designate any
Foreign Subsidiary that complies with the requirements described in Section
5.10(f) as a Foreign Subsidiary Loan Party.

            SECTION 2.21. Additional Reserve Costs. (a) For so long as any
Lender is required to make special deposits with the Bank of England or comply
with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of the Bank of
England, to maintain reserve asset ratios or to pay fees, in each case in
respect of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans or Swingline Foreign Currency Loans,
such Lender shall be entitled to require the applicable Borrower to pay,
contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans,
additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory
Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth
in Exhibit L hereto.

                                                                             112

                  (b) For so long as any Lender is required to comply with
reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any monetary or
other authority (including any such requirement imposed by the European Central
Bank or the European System of Central Banks, but excluding requirements
reflected in the Statutory Reserves or the Mandatory Costs Rate) in respect of
any of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans Swingline Foreign Currency Loans, such
Lender shall be entitled to require the applicable Borrower to pay,
contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Loans
subject to such requirements, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per
annum specified by such Lender to be the cost to such Lender of complying with
such requirements in relation to such Loan.

                  (c) Any additional interest owed pursuant to paragraph (a) or
(b) above shall be determined by the applicable Lender, which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and notified to the applicable
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least five Business Days
before each date on which interest is payable for the applicable Loan, and such
additional interest so notified to the applicable Borrower by such Lender shall
be payable to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender on each
date on which interest is payable for such Loan.

            SECTION 2.22. Ancillary Facilities. (a) General. If a Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower and a Global Revolving Facility Lender agree, subject to
(i) compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 2.22 and (ii)
such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower having complied with Sections 2.20 and 4.03,
such Global Revolving Facility Lender shall be permitted to provide an
Ancillary Facility on a bilateral basis to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower.
The total Ancillary Commitments shall not at any time exceed the Ancillary
Commitment Limit.

                  (b) Creation of Ancillary Facilities. To request the creation
of an Ancillary Facility, a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent not later than 10 Business Days prior to the first date on

            date of such Ancillary Facility (which shall be no later than the

      Administrative Agent), together with a certificate of a Responsible

                  (iii) such other information that the Administrative Agent may
      reasonably request in connection with such Ancillary Facility.

The Administrative Agent shall give notice to each Global Revolving Facility

of such matters.


                  (d) Terms of Ancillary Facility. Each Ancillary Facility shall
contain terms and conditions acceptable to the applicable Ancillary Lender and

      "Notice of Termination") not later than five Business Days prior to the

            Borrower and Ancillary Lender;

                        (B) the aggregate amount of Ancillary Credit Extensions

            "Ancillary Facility Repayment Amount"); and

                        (C) the applicable Ancillary Facility Termination Date.

                  (iii) Following receipt of a Notice of Termination with

                        (A) the name of the Eligible Borrower that shall make

                        (B) the currency in which such Ancillary Replacement
            Borrowing is to be denominated (which shall be Dollars, Euros or
            Sterling);

                        (C) the initial Interest Period to be applicable to such

            contemplated by clause (a) of the definition of the term "Interest

                        (D) the location and number of the applicable Eligible
            Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed.

                  (iv) On the Ancillary Facility Termination Date for an
      Ancillary Facility, the Global Revolving Facility Lenders shall make Loans
      composing an Ancillary Replacement Borrowing in an aggregate principal

      Sections 2.02 and 2.06.

                  (v) The Eligible Borrower to which such Ancillary Replacement
      Borrowing is made shall use the proceeds of such Ancillary Replacement

      Facility and (ii) to deposit cash collateral with such Ancillary Lender

<PAGE>

                                                                             116

      in respect of all Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extensions under such
      terminated Ancillary Facility. Each deposit of cash collateral pursuant to
      this paragraph shall be held by the applicable Global Revolving Facility
      Lender as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of
      the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower in respect of Unfunded
      Ancillary Credit Extensions under such terminated Ancillary Facility. Such
      Global Revolving Facility Lender shall have exclusive dominion and
      control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account;
      provided that, on the CAM Exchange Date, the Administrative Agent shall
      assume exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of
      withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the
      investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option
      and sole discretion of (i) for so long as an Event of Default shall be
      continuing, the applicable Global Revolving Facility Lender and (ii) at
      any other time, the applicable Eligible Borrower, in each case, in
      Permitted Investments and at the risk and expense of such Eligible
      Borrower, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
      any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
      account shall be applied by the applicable Global Revolving Facility
      Lender to offset amounts payable in respect of Unfunded Ancillary Credit
      Extensions made under such terminated Ancillary Facility. In the event
      that after the ancillary Facility Termination Date for an ancillary
      Facility but prior to the CAM Exchange Date, an Unfunded Ancillary Credit
      Extension made under such terminated Ancillary Facility shall expire
      without requiring payment, the portion of the cash collateral deposited
      hereunder with respect to such expired Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension
      shall be distributed to the applicable Eligible Borrower.

                  (f) Cancelation by Foreign Subsidiary Borrower. The Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower to which an Ancillary Facility has been made available shall
be permitted at any time to request the cancelation of all or a portion of such
Ancillary Facility by delivery of a notice in writing to the Administrative
Agent and the applicable Ancillary Lender, specifying the Ancillary Facility to
be canceled and the proposed cancelation date. Such notice shall be delivered
not less than five Business Days prior to the proposed cancelation date. Such
cancelation shall be effective as of the proposed cancelation date unless the
Ancillary Facility Exposure under such Ancillary Facility has not been reduced
to zero as of such date.

<PAGE>

                                                                             117

                  (g) Additional Information. Each Ancillary Lender shall report
in writing to the Administrative Agent on the first Business Day of each fiscal
quarter (i) the Ancillary Facility Exposure for each day during the preceding
fiscal quarter for each Ancillary Facility under which it is an Ancillary Lender
and (ii) the portion (expressed in Dollars) of its Ancillary Commitment that was
unused on each day during the preceding fiscal quarter for each Ancillary
Facility under which it is an Ancillary Lender. In addition, each Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower to which an Ancillary Facility has been made available and
each Ancillary Lender shall, upon request by the Administrative Agent, promptly
supply the Administrative Agent with any information relating to the operation
of such Ancillary Facility (including the Ancillary Facility Exposure) as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

                  (h) Conflict with Loan Documents. In the event of any conflict
between the terms of an Ancillary Facility Document and any other Loan Document
(other than an Ancillary Facility Document), the terms of such other Loan
Document shall govern.

                  (i) Termination and Expiration of Ancillary Commitments. On
each date on which an Ancillary Facility expires, is terminated or is canceled
(in whole or in part), the Available Unused Commitment of the Ancillary Lender
under such Ancillary Facility shall be increased by an amount equal to the
portion of such Ancillary Facility that has expired or been canceled, unless the
Global Revolving Facility Commitments shall have been previously terminated.

                  (j) Effect of Restatement Transactions on Ancillary
Facilities. The consummation of the Restatement Transactions shall not have any
effect on any Ancillary Facility that has been provided and is in effect on the
Restatement Effective Date.

obligation of such Loan Party enforceable against each such Loan Party in
accordance with its terms, subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity

equity or at law) and (iii) implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.

business, operations, properties, assets or financial condition of the U.S.
Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, it being understood that prior

other limited property interests in, all its properties and assets (including
all Mortgaged Properties), except for minor defects in title that do not
interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to
utilize such properties and assets for their intended purposes and except where

                  (b) Each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
and the Subsidiaries has complied with all obligations under all leases to which
it is a party, except where the failure to comply would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, and all such leases are in full force and effect, except leases
in respect of which the failure to be in full force and effect could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases, other than leases in
respect of which the failure to enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
and the Subsidiaries owns or possesses, or could obtain ownership or possession
of, on terms not materially adverse to it, all patents, trademarks, service

Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries has received any
notice of any pending or contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any of

or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the U.S. Borrower, threatened in writing
against or affecting Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S.

Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any business, property or rights of any
such person (i) that involve any Loan Document or the Transactions or (ii) as to

the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be timely
filed all federal, and all material state and local, Tax returns (and, in the
case of a Foreign Subsidiary, except as provided in Schedule 3.13, all material

<PAGE>

                                                                             124

concerning Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower, the Subsidiaries,
the Restatement Transactions and any other transactions contemplated hereby
included in the Lenders' Presentation or otherwise prepared by or on behalf of
the foregoing or their representatives and made available to any Lenders or the
Administrative Agent in connection with the Restatement Transactions or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, when taken as a whole, were true and
correct in all material respects as of the date thereof, as of the date such
Information was first furnished to the Lenders and as of the Restatement
Effective Date and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact as of
any such date or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made.

                  (b) The Projections and estimates prepared by or on behalf of
the U.S. Borrower or any of its representatives and that have been made
available to any Lenders or the Administrative Agent in connection with the
Restatement Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby (i) have
been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed by the U.S. Borrower
to be reasonable as of the date thereof, as of the date such Projections and
estimates were first furnished to the Lenders and as of the Restatement
Effective Date, and (ii) as of the Restatement Effective Date, have not been
modified in any material respect by the U.S. Borrower.

            SECTION 3.15. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Each of the Borrowers,
Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates is in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the provisions of the
Code relating to Plans and the regulations and published interpretations
thereunder and any similar applicable non-U.S. law, except for such
noncompliance that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Reportable Event has occurred during the past five years as to which
the Borrowers, Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, any Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate was required to file a report with the PBGC, other than reports that
have been filed and reports the failure of which to file could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the Restatement Effective
Date, the excess of the present value of all benefit liabilities under each Plan
of the Borrowers, Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Subsidiaries and the
ERISA Affiliates (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plan), as of the
last annual valuation date applicable thereto for which a valuation is
available, over the value of the assets of such Plan could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and the excess of the present value
of

<PAGE>

                                                                             125

all benefit liabilities of all underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions
used to fund each such Plan) as of the last annual valuation dates applicable
thereto for which valuations are available, over the value of the assets of all
such underfunded Plans could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. None of the Borrowers, Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the
Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates has incurred or could reasonably be
expected to incur any Withdrawal Liability that could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Borrowers, Holdings, Intermediate
Holdings, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates has received any written
notification that any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been
terminated within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, or has knowledge that any
Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be in reorganization or to be
terminated, where such reorganization or termination has had or could reasonably
be expected to have, through increases in the contributions required to be made
to such Plan or otherwise, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
and the Subsidiaries is in compliance (i) with all applicable provisions of law
and all applicable regulations and published interpretations thereunder with
respect to any employee pension benefit plan or other employee benefit plan
governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States and (ii)
with the terms of any such plan, except, in each case, for such noncompliance
that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.16. Environmental Matters. Except for the matters that
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, neither the U.S. Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
(i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) is subject to, or responsible for, any Environmental
Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any
Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any Environmental Liability.

            SECTION 3.17. Security Documents. (a) The U.S. Collateral Agreement
is effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the
Secured Parties) a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the
Collateral described therein and proceeds thereof. In the case of the Pledged
Collateral described in the U.S. Collateral Agreement, when certificates or
promissory notes, as applicable, representing such Pledged Collateral are
delivered to the

<PAGE>

                                                                             126

Collateral Agent, and in the case of the other Collateral described in the U.S.
Collateral Agreement (other than the Intellectual Property (as defined in the
U.S. Collateral Agreement)), when financing statements and other filings
specified on Schedule 3 of the U.S. Perfection Certificate in appropriate form
are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 5 of the U.S. Perfection
Certificate, the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall
have a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and
interest of the Loan Parties in such Collateral and, subject to Section 9-315 of
the New York Uniform Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof, as security for the
Obligations to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing Uniform
Commercial Code financing statements, in each case prior and superior in right
to any other person (except, in the case of Collateral other than Pledged
Collateral, Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02(a) and Liens having
priority by operation of law).

                  (b) When the U.S. Collateral Agreement or a summary thereof is
properly filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United
States Copyright Office, and, with respect to Collateral in which a security
interest cannot be perfected by such filings, upon the proper filing of the
financing statements referred to in paragraph (a) above, the Collateral Agent
(for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall have a fully perfected Lien on,
and security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties
thereunder in the Intellectual Property, in each case prior and superior in
right to any other Person (it being understood that subsequent recordings in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office
may be necessary to perfect a lien on registered trademarks and patents,
trademark and patent applications and registered copyrights acquired by the
grantors after the Closing Date).

                  (c) Each Foreign Pledge Agreement and each Foreign Security
Agreement is effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest
in the Collateral described therein and proceeds thereof. In the case of the
Pledged Collateral described in a Foreign Pledge Agreement, when certificates or
promissory notes, as applicable, representing such Pledged Collateral are
delivered to the Collateral Agent, and, in the case of the Collateral described
in a Foreign Security Agreement, when filings are made in the appropriate
offices in each relevant jurisdiction and the other actions, if any, specified
on such Schedule are taken, the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured
Parties) shall have a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all
right, title and

<PAGE>

                                                                             127

interest of the Loan Parties in such Collateral and the proceeds thereof, as
security for the Obligations, in each case prior and superior in right to any
other person (except, in the case of Collateral other than Pledged Collateral,
Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02(a) and Liens having priority by
operation of law).

                  (d) The Mortgages entered into after the Closing Date pursuant
to Section 5.10 shall be effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent
(for the benefit of the Secured Parties) a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on
all of the Loan Parties' right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged
Property thereunder and the proceeds thereof, and when such Mortgages are filed
or recorded in the proper real estate filing or recording offices, the
Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall have a fully
perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of
the Loan Parties in such Mortgaged Property and, to the extent applicable,
subject to Section 9-315 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof,
in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other than with
respect to the rights of a Person pursuant to Liens expressly permitted by
Section 6.02(a) and Liens having priority by operation of law.

            SECTION 3.18. Location of Real Property and Leased Premises. (a)
Schedule 2B to the U.S. Perfection Certificate and each Foreign Perfection
Certificate lists completely and correctly as of the Closing Date all material
real property owned by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and
the Subsidiary Loan Parties and the addresses thereof. As of the Closing Date,
Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries own in
fee all the real property set forth as being owned by them on such Schedules.

                  (b) Schedule 2B to the U.S. Perfection Certificate lists

leased by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Domestic
Subsidiary Loan Parties and the addresses thereof. As of the Closing Date,
Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Domestic Subsidiary
Loan Parties have valid leases in all the real property set forth as being
leased by them on such Schedules.

            SECTION 3.19. Solvency. (a) Immediately after giving effect to the
Restatement Transactions (i) the fair value of the assets of each Borrower
(individually) and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of each Borrower (individually) and the

<PAGE>

                                                                             128

U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, respectively; (ii)
the present fair saleable value of the property of each Borrower (individually)
and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of
each Borrower (individually) and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, respectively, on their debts and other liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (iii) each Borrower (individually) and the U.S.
Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay their
debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (iv) each Borrower
(individually) and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the
businesses in which they are engaged as such businesses are now conducted and
are proposed to be conducted following the Restatement Effective Date.

                  (b) None of Holdings or the Borrowers intend to, and does not
believe that it or any of its subsidiaries will, incur debts beyond its ability
to pay such debts as they mature, taking into account the timing and amounts of
cash to be received by it or any such subsidiary and the timing and amounts of
cash to be payable on or in respect of its Indebtedness or the Indebtedness of
any such subsidiary.

            SECTION 3.20. Labor Matters. There are no strikes pending or
threatened against Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of
the Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The hours worked and payments made
to employees of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the
Subsidiaries have not been in violation in any material respect of the Fair
Labor Standards Act or any other applicable law dealing with such matters. All
material payments due from Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or
any of the Subsidiaries or for which any claim may be made against Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, on account
of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings,
the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary to the extent required by GAAP. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.20, consummation of the Transactions will not give rise
to a right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union
under any collective bargaining agreement to which Holdings, Intermediate
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (or any

<PAGE>

                                                                             129

predecessor) is a party or by which Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S.
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (or any predecessor) is bound, other than
collective bargaining agreements that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
material to Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

without any deduction for depreciation, and such other provisions as the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may reasonably (in light of a
Default or a material development in respect of the insured Mortgaged Property)
require from time to time to protect their interests; deliver original or
certified copies of all such policies or a certificate of an insurance broker to
the Collateral Agent; cause each such policy to provide that it shall not be
canceled, modified or not renewed upon less than 30 days' prior written notice
thereof by the insurer to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent;
deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, prior to the

                  (c) If at any time the area in which the Premises (as defined

and against such risks as are customarily maintained by companies engaged in the
same or similar industry operating in the same or similar locations naming the
Collateral Agent as an additional insured, on forms reasonably satisfactory to
the Collateral Agent.

                  (e) Notify the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent

                  (f) In connection with the covenants set forth in this Section
5.02, it is understood and agreed that:

                  (i) none of the Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and
      their respective agents or employees shall be liable for any loss or
      damage insured by the insurance policies required to be maintained under
      this Section 5.02, it being understood that (A) the U.S. Borrower and the
      other Loan Parties shall look solely to their insurance companies or any
      other parties other than the aforesaid parties for the recovery of such
      loss or damage and (B) such insurance companies shall have no rights of
      subrogation against the Agents, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank or their
      agents or employees. If, however, the insurance policies do not provide
      waiver of subrogation rights against such parties, as required above, then
      each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings and the U.S. Borrower hereby
      agree, to the extent permitted by law, to waive, and to cause each of the
      Subsidiaries to waive, its right of recovery, if any, against the Agents,
      the Lenders, any Issuing Bank and their agents and employees; and

                  (ii) the designation of any form, type or amount of insurance
      coverage by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent under this
      Section 5.02 shall in no event be deemed a representation, warranty or
      advice by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders
      that such insurance is adequate for the purposes of the business of
      Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries or
      the protection of their properties.

            SECTION 5.03. Taxes. Pay and discharge promptly when due all
material Taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it
or upon its income or profits or in respect of its property, before the same
shall become delinquent or in default, as well as all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies or otherwise that, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien
upon such properties or any part thereof; provided, however, that such payment
and discharge shall not be required with respect to any such Tax, assessment,
charge, levy or claim so long as the validity or amount thereof shall be
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and Holdings, Intermediate
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the affected Subsidiary, as applicable, shall
have set aside on its books reserves in accordance with GAAP with respect
thereto and such contest effectively suspends collection of the contested
obligation and the enforcement of any Lien securing such obligation.

made, or will have been made within any statutory period, under the Uniform
Commercial Code or otherwise that are required in order for the Collateral Agent
to continue at all times following such change to have a valid, legal and

presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are

Borrowers, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding.

            SECTION 7.02. Exclusion of Immaterial Subsidiaries. Solely for the
purposes of determining whether a Default has occurred under clause (h) or (i)
of Section 7.01, any reference in any such clause to any Subsidiary shall be
deemed not to include any Subsidiary affected by any event or circumstance
referred to in any such clause that did not, as of the last day of the fiscal
quarter of the U.S. Borrower most recently ended, have assets with a value in
excess of 5.0% of the Consolidated Total Assets or 5.0% of total revenues of the
U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of such date, provided that if it is
necessary to exclude more than one Subsidiary from clause (h) or (i) of Section
7.01 pursuant to this Section 7.02 in order to avoid an Event of Default
thereunder, all excluded Subsidiaries shall be considered to be a single
consolidated Subsidiary for

            SECTION 7.03. U.S. Borrower's Right to Cure. (a) Financial
Performance Covenants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 7.01, in the event that the U.S. Borrower fails to comply with the
requirements of any Financial Performance Covenant, until the expiration of the
10th day subsequent to the date the certificate calculating such Financial
Performance Covenant is required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(c),
Holdings shall have the right to issue Permitted Cure Securities for cash or
otherwise receive cash contributions to the capital of Holdings, and, in each
case, to contribute any such cash to the capital of Intermediate Holdings (which
shall contribute all such cash to the capital of the U.S. Borrower)
(collectively, the "Cure Right"), and upon the receipt by U.S. Borrower of such
cash (the "Cure Amount") pursuant to the exercise by Holdings of such Cure Right
such Financial Performance Covenant shall be recalculated giving effect to the
following pro forma adjustments:

                  (i) EBITDA shall be increased, solely for the purpose of
      measuring the Financial Performance Covenants and not for any other
      purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure Amount; and

                  (ii) If, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations,
      the U.S. Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of all
      Financial Performance Covenants, the U.S. Borrower shall be deemed to have
      satisfied the requirements of the Financial Performance Covenants as of
      the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there
      had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable
      breach or default of the Financial Performance Covenants that had occurred
      shall be deemed cured for this purposes of the Agreement.

                  (b) Limitation on Exercise of Cure Right. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (a) in each four-fiscal-quarter period there
shall be at least one fiscal quarter in which the Cure Right is not exercised,
(b) in each eight-fiscal-quarter period, there shall be a period of at least
four consecutive fiscal quarters during which the Cure Right is not exercised
and (c) in each 12-month period, the sum of all Cure Amounts contributed to the
U.S. Borrower pursuant to this Section 7.03 shall not exceed $200,000,000.

portion of the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents, all rights and
remedies in respect of such Collateral shall be controlled by the Collateral

delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any
inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrowers or any other

any Loan Document. The Agents shall not be responsible to the Lenders or any
Ancillary Lender for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or
effectiveness of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or other instruments
or agreements. The Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or
refraining from acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such
instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all
the Lenders and all the Ancillary Lenders. Each Agent shall, in the absence of
knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any instrument or document
believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed
or sent by the proper person or persons. Neither the Agents nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any
responsibility to any Borrower or any other Loan Party or any other party hereto
on account of the failure, delay in performance or breach by, or as a result of
information provided by, any Lender, Ancillary Lender or Issuing Bank of any of
its obligations hereunder or to any Lender, Ancillary Lender or Issuing Bank on
account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other Lender,
Ancillary Lender or Issuing Bank or any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any
of their respective obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in

hereunder by or through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon
the advice of legal counsel selected by it with respect to all matters arising
hereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith
by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

Lenders hereby acknowledge that no Agent shall be under any duty to take any
discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required
Lenders. The Lenders and the Ancillary Lenders further acknowledge and agree
that so long as an Agent shall make any determination to be made by it hereunder
or under any other Loan Document in good faith, such Agent shall have no
liability in respect of such determination to any person. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative

                                                                             175

Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set

Documentation Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender or Ancillary Lenders, and shall have no functions, responsibilities,
duties, obligations or liabilities for acting as the Co-Syndication Agents or as
a Documentation Agent hereunder.

            SECTION 8.03. Resignation by the Agents. Subject to the appointment

any time by notifying the Lenders and the U.S. Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
with the consent of the U.S. Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and approved by the U.S. Borrower and shall have accepted such appointment
within 45 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Ancillary Lenders with
the consent of the U.S. Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New
York and an office in London, England (or a bank having an Affiliate with such
an office) having a combined capital and surplus having a Dollar Equivalent that
is not less than $500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

            SECTION 8.04. Each Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to
the Loans made by it hereunder and Ancillary Facilities made available by it
pursuant to Section 2.22, each Agent in its individual capacity and not as Agent
shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not an Agent, and the Agents and their Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business
with any Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or other Affiliates thereof as if
it were not an Agent.

            SECTION 8.05. Indemnification. Each Lender and each Ancillary Lender
agrees (a) to reimburse the Agents, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata
share (based on its Commitments hereunder (or if such Commitments shall have
expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts
of its applicable outstanding Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements, as
applicable)) of any reasonable expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders
and Ancillary Lenders by the Agents, including counsel fees and compensation of
agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders and
Ancillary Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed by the U.S. Borrower and
(b) to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and any of its directors,
officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro rata share,
from and against any and all liabilities, Taxes, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against it in its capacity as Agent or any of them in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or
omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to
the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the U.S. Borrower,
provided that no Lender or Ancillary Lender shall be liable to an Agent for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of such Agent or any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents.

            SECTION 8.06. Lack of Reliance on Agents. Each Lender and each
Ancillary Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Agents, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each Ancillary Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agents, any other Lender or any Ancillary Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

            SECTION 8.07. Designation of Affiliates for Foreign Currency Loans.

            SECTION 9.02. Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the U.S. Borrower and the Loan Parties
herein, in the other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments
prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any

each Issuing Bank and each Ancillary Lender and shall survive the making by the
Lenders of the Loans, the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the
issuance of the Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by such
persons or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long
as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or L/C Disbursement, any
extension of credit under Ancillary Facility remains outstanding or any Fee or
any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is
outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the

other agreements contained herein, indemnification and reimbursement obligations
contained herein (including pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.15, 2.18 and 9.05)
shall survive the payment in full of the principal and interest hereunder, the
expiration of the Letters of Credit and the termination of the Commitments or
this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.03. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by Holdings,

the U.S. Borrower and the Agents and when the Administrative Agent shall have
received copies hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each
of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Holdings, the Borrowers, each Issuing Bank, the Agents and each
Lender and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

            SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i)
other than pursuant to a merger permitted by Section 6.05(b) or 6.05(i), no
Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Agents, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                        (A) the U.S. Borrower; provided that no consent of the
            U.S. Borrower shall be required for (1) an assignment of a Term Loan
            to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or (2) if
            an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, an assignment of
            any Loan to any assignee (provided that any liability of the
            Borrowers to an assignee that is an Approved Fund or Affiliate of
            the assigning Lender under Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.21 shall be
            limited to the amount, if any, that would have been payable
            thereunder by such Borrower in the absence of such assignment); and

                                                                             180

                        (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent
            of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of a
            Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or Approved Fund
            immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

            (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

                        (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an
            Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the
            entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the
            amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each
            such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
            Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
            Administrative Agent) shall not be less than (x) $5,000,000, in the
            case of Revolving Credit Commitments, Revolving Loans denominated in
            Dollars and Tranche A-1 Term Loans, (y) the smallest amount of the
            applicable Foreign Currency that is a multiple of 1,000,000 units of
            such Foreign Currency and has a Dollar Equivalent in excess of
            $5,000,000, in the case of Tranche D-2 Term Loans and Global
            Revolving Facility Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency and (z)
            $1,000,000, in the case of Tranche D-1 Term Loans or Tranche E Term
            Loans, unless each of the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent
            otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the U.S.
            Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under paragraph
            (b), (c), (h) or (i) of Section 7.01 has occurred and is continuing;

                        (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an
            assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
            rights and obligations under this Agreement;

                        (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
            deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
            together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

                        (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
            deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;
            and

                        (E) no assignment of Global Revolving Facility Loans or
            Global Revolving Facility Commitments shall

<PAGE>

                                                                             181

            be permitted to be made to an assignee that cannot make Global
            Revolving Facility Loans in Dollars and each of the Foreign
            Currencies.

            For purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved Fund" shall
have the following meaning:

            "Approved Fund" shall mean any person (other than a natural person)
that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and
similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is
administered or managed by a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an entity or an
Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

            (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (c) of this Section.

            (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent
of the U.S. Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans and L/C Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, and the U.S. Borrower, the Agents, each Issuing Bank and
the Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the U.S. Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender,
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

<PAGE>

                                                                             182

            (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the U.S.
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in
all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the
Agents, each Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in Section 9.04(a)(i) or clauses (i) (disregarding for this purpose
the parenthetical contained therein), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of the
first proviso to Section 9.08(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to
paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, each of the Borrowers agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.06 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

            (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the

<PAGE>

                                                                             183

sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the U.S. Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the U.S.
Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section
2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

            SECTION 9.05. Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The U.S. Borrower agrees to
pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including documentary Taxes) incurred
by the Agents in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, or by the Agents in connection with the syndication of the
Commitments or the administration of this Agreement (including expenses incurred
in connection with due diligence and initial and ongoing Collateral examination
to the extent incurred with the reasonable prior approval of the U.S. Borrower
and the reasonable fees, disbursements and the charges for no more than one
counsel in each jurisdiction where Collateral is located) or in connection with
any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof
(whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be consummated) or
incurred by the Agents, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender in connection with
the enforcement or protection of their rights in connection with this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, in connection with the Loans made, the Ancillary
Facilities made available pursuant to Section 2.22 or the Letters of Credit
issued hereunder, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent, and, in connection with any such enforcement or protection,
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any other counsel (including
the reasonable allocated costs of internal counsel if a Lender elects to use
internal counsel in lieu of outside counsel) for the Agents, any Issuing Bank,
any Lender or any Ancillary Lender (but no more than one such counsel for any
Lender or any Ancillary Lender).

                  (b) The U.S. Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agents, each
Issuing Bank, each Lender, each Ancillary Lender and

<PAGE>

                                                                             184

each of their respective directors, trustees, officers, employees and agents
(each such person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and to hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way
connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their
respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the
Loans or the use of any Letter of Credit or (iii) any claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any
Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses result primarily from the gross negligence or
wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee (treating, for this purpose only, any
Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender, any Ancillary Lender and any of their
respective Related Parties as a single Indemnitee). Subject to and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the U.S. Borrower agrees to
indemnify each Indemnitee against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including
reasonable counsel or consultant fees, charges and disbursements, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as
a result of (A) any Environmental Claim related in any way to Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or (B) any
actual or alleged presence, Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Materials
on any Property or any property owned, leased or operated by any predecessor of
Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries,
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee or any of its Related Parties. The provisions of this Section 9.05
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration
of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent, any Issuing
Bank, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender. All amounts due under this Section
9.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.

                                                                             185

                  (c) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the U.S. Borrower shall be entitled to assume the defense of any
action for which indemnification is sought hereunder with counsel of its choice
at its expense (in which case the U.S. Borrower shall not thereafter be
responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by an
Indemnitee except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to each such Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the
U.S. Borrower's election to assume the defense of such action, each Indemnitee
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense of such action, and the U.S. Borrower shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of such separate counsel, if (i) the use of counsel chosen by
the U.S. Borrower to represent such Indemnitee would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of,
any such action include both the U.S. Borrower and such Indemnitee and such
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the
U.S. Borrower (in which case the U.S. Borrower shall not have the right to
assume the defense or such action on behalf of such Indemnitee); (iii) the U.S.
Borrower shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnitee to represent it within a reasonable time after notice of the
institution of such action; or (iv) the U.S. Borrower shall authorize such
Indemnitee to employ separate counsel at the U.S. Borrower's expense. The U.S.
Borrower will not be liable under this Agreement for any amount paid by an
Indemnitee to settle any claims or actions if the settlement is entered into
without the U.S. Borrower's consent, which consent may not be withheld or
delayed unless such settlement is unreasonable in light of such claims or
actions against, and defenses available to, such Indemnitee.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
9.05, this Section 9.05 shall not apply to Taxes, it being understood that the
U.S. Borrower's only obligations with respect to Taxes shall arise under
Sections 2.15 and 2.17.

            SECTION 9.06. Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each Ancillary
Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such
Ancillary Lender to or for the credit or the account of Holdings, Intermediate
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or

<PAGE>

                                                                             186

any Subsidiary against any of and all the obligations of Holdings or the U.S.
Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document held by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Ancillary Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Ancillary
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan
Document and although the obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each
Lender, each Issuing Bank and each Ancillary Lender under this Section 9.06 are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off)
that such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Ancillary Lender may have.

            SECTION 9.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT AND AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

            SECTION 9.08. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of the
Agents, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender in exercising any
right or power hereunder or under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, each Issuing Bank, the
Lenders and each Ancillary Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or consent to any departure by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, any
Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose
for which given. No notice or demand on Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, any
Borrower or any other Loan Party in any case shall entitle such person to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except (x) in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Borrowers and the Required
Lenders, (y) in the case of any Ancillary Facility Document, pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each party thereto and (z) in
the case of any other Loan

                                                                             187

Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each
party thereto and the Collateral Agent and consented to by the Required Lenders;
provided, however, that no such agreement shall (i) decrease or forgive the
principal amount of, or extend the final maturity of, or decrease the rate of
interest on, any Loan or any L/C Disbursement, without the prior written consent
of each Lender directly affected thereby, (ii) increase or extend the Commitment
of any Lender or decrease the Commitment Fees or L/C Participation Fees or other
fees of any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender, (iii)
extend or waive any Installment Date or extend any date on which payment of
interest on any Loan or any L/C Disbursement is due, without the prior written
consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (iv) amend or modify the
provisions of Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would by its terms alter
the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the prior written
consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (v) amend or modify the

provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality

possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

            SECTION 9.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or

Loan Documents against Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, any Borrower or any Loan
Party or their properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

other than as a result of a disclosure by such party, (b) has been independently
developed by such Lender, such Issuing Bank, such Ancillary Lender or such Agent
without violating this Section 9.16 or (c) was available to such Lender, such
Issuing Bank, such Ancillary Lender or such Agent from a third party having, to
such person's knowledge, no obligations of confidentiality to Holdings,

            SECTION 9.17. Conversion of Currencies. (a) If, for the purpose of
obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing
hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto (including
any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower) agrees, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first
currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day
immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.

                  (b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due
to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the
"Applicable Creditor") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the
"Judgment Currency") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be
due hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that,
on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase
the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrowers
contained in this Section 9.17 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

            SECTION 10.01. Exchange of Interests in Ancillary Facilities. (a) On
the CAM Exchange Date and immediately prior to the deemed exchange of interests
pursuant to the CAM Exchange as provided in Section 11.01(a)(ii):

                  (i) the principal amount of each Global Revolving Facility
      Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency and of each Ancillary Credit
      Extension shall, automatically and with no further action required, be
      converted into the Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rates
      calculated

                                                                             192

      as of the CAM Exchange Date, of such amount and, subject to Section
      11.01(a)(iv), on and after such date all amounts accruing and owed to any
      Lender or any Ancillary Lender in respect of such Obligations shall accrue
      and be payable in Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder;

                  (ii) in the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Unfunded
      Ancillary Credit Extension (in respect of which cash collateral shall not
      have previously been deposited pursuant to Section 2.22(e)) shall exist,
      or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall have failed to
      reimburse a disbursement made by the applicable Ancillary Lender, the
      applicable Ancillary Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative
      Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount in Dollars equal to such
      Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension or unreimbursed disbursement, together
      with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such
      amount shall be paid to the Administrative Agent at the rate that would be
      applicable at the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a principal amount
      equal to such Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension or unreimbursed
      disbursement. The Administrative Agent shall establish an account (the
      "Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension Account") and shall deposit all
      amounts received pursuant to the previous sentence and all amounts of cash
      collateral previously deposited pursuant to Section 2.22(e) in the
      Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension Account pending application of such
      amounts pursuant to Section 11.02. The Administrative Agent shall have
      sole dominion and control over the Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension
      Account; and

                  (iii) there shall be a deemed buying and selling of interests
      (without regard to Section 9.04) in the outstanding Global Revolving
      Facility Loans and Ancillary Credit Extensions by the Global Revolving
      Facility Lenders (and each Global Revolving Facility Lender shall promptly
      make payment therefor to the Administrative Agent in the same manner as
      provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Global
      Revolving Facility Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis,
      to such payment obligations of such Global Revolving Facility Lender) for
      distribution to the applicable Global Revolving Facility Lenders) such
      that, after giving effect to such deemed buying and selling of interests,
      each Global Revolving Facility Lender holds its ratable share of the
      Global Revolving Facility Loans (based on the respective Global Revolving
      Facility Commitments of the Global Revolving Facility Lenders immediately
      prior to the CAM Exchange

                         Collection Allocation Mechanism

            SECTION 11.01. Implementation of CAM.(a) On the CAM Exchange Date,
(i) the Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as
provided in Section 7.01, (ii) each Global Revolving Facility Lender shall
immediately be deemed to have acquired (and shall promptly make payment therefor
to the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.04(c)) participations in
the Swingline Loans (other than any Swingline Foreign Currency Loan in respect
of which Global Revolving Facility Lenders have funded their purchase of
participations pursuant to Section 2.04(c)) in an amount equal to such Global
Revolving Facility Lender's ratable share (based on the respective Global
Revolving Facility Commitments of the Global Revolving Facility Lenders
immediately prior to the CAM Exchange Date) of each Swingline Foreign Currency
Loan outstanding on such date, (iii) each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender shall
immediately be deemed to have acquired (and shall promptly make payment therefor
to the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.04(c)) participations in
the Swingline Dollar Loans (other than any Swingline Dollar Loan in respect of
which the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders have funded their purchase of
participations pursuant to Section 2.04(c)) in an amount equal to such U.S.
Revolving Facility Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of each Swingline
Dollar Loan outstanding on such date, (iv) simultaneously with the automatic
conversions pursuant to clause (v) below, the Lenders shall automatically and
without further act (and without regard to the provisions of Section 9.04) be
deemed to have exchanged interests in the Loans (other than the Swingline
Loans), Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions and participations in Unfunded
Ancillary Credit Extensions, Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit, such that in
lieu of the interest of each Lender in each Loan, Letter of Credit and Ancillary
Credit Extension in which it shall participate as of such date (including such
Lender's interest in the Obligations of each Loan Party in respect of each such
Loan, Letter of Credit and Ancillary Credit Extension), such Lender shall hold
an interest in every one of the Loans (other than the Swingline Loans) and
Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions and a participation in every one of the
Swingline Loans, Letters of Credit and Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extensions
(including the Obligations of each Loan Party in respect of each such Loan and

Ancillary Credit Extension and each Reserve Account established pursuant to
Section 11.02 below), whether or not such Lender shall previously have
participated therein, equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage thereof and (v)
simultaneously with the deemed exchange of interests pursuant to clause (iv)
above, (A) in the case of the CAM Euro Lenders, the interest in the Loans and
Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions denominated in a currency other than Euros to
be received in such deemed exchange shall, automatically and with no further
action required, be converted into the Euro Equivalent, determined using the
Exchange Rate calculated as of such date, of such amount and on and after such
date all amounts accruing and owed to the CAM Euro Lenders in respect of such
Obligations shall accrue and be payable in Euros at the rates otherwise
applicable hereunder and (B) in the case of the CAM Dollar Lenders, the
interests in the Loans and Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions to be received in
such deemed exchange shall, automatically and with no further action required,
be converted into the Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rate
calculated as of such date, of such amount and on and after such date all
amounts accruing and owed to the CAM Dollar Lenders in respect of such
Obligation shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rate otherwise
applicable hereunder. Each Lender and each Loan Party hereby consents and agrees
to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be
binding upon its successors and assigns and any person that acquires a
participation in its interests in any Loan or Ancillary Credit Extension. Each
Loan Party agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the
respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and
each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it
in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against
delivery of any promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Loans and
Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions so executed and delivered; provided, however,
that the failure of any Loan Party to execute or deliver or of any Lender to
accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the
validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.

                  (b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM
Exchange Date, each payment received by the Applicable Agent or the Collateral
Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Obligations, and each
distribution made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to any Security Document in
respect of the Obligations, shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in
accordance with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment received by
a Lender upon or after the CAM

                                                                             195

Exchange Date, including by way of set-off, in respect of an Obligation shall be
paid over to the Applicable Agent for distribution to the Lenders in accordance
herewith.

            SECTION 11.02. Letters of Credit and Unfunded Ancillary Credit
Extensions. (a) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit
shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any L/C Disbursement
shall not have been reimbursed either by an Applicant Party or, in the case of
any L/C Disbursement made in Dollars, with the proceeds of a U.S. Revolving
Facility Borrowing or Swingline Dollar Borrowing, each U.S. Revolving Facility
Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately
available funds, an amount in Dollars equal to such U.S. Revolving Facility
Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of such undrawn face amount (or, in
the case of any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit, the Dollar Equivalent of such
face amount) or (to the extent it has not already done so) such unreimbursed
drawing, as applicable, together with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange
Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to the Administrative Agent
at the rate that would be applicable at the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a
principal amount equal to such undrawn face amount or unreimbursed drawing, as
applicable. The Administrative Agent shall establish a separate account (each, a
"Reserve Account") or accounts for each Lender for the amounts received with
respect to each such Letter of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence The
Administrative Agent shall deposit in each Lender's Reserve Account such
Lender's CAM Percentage of (x) the amounts received from the Revolving Credit
Lenders as provided above and (y) the amounts on deposit in the Unfunded
Ancillary Credit Extension Account. The Administrative Agent shall have sole
dominion and control over each Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in
each Reserve Account shall be held in such Reserve Account until withdrawn as
provided in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) below. The Administrative Agent shall
maintain records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and
deposited in the Reserve Accounts in respect of each Letter of Credit and
Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension and the amounts on deposit in respect of
each Letter of Credit and Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension attributable to
each Lender's CAM Percentage. The amounts held in each Lender's Reserve Account
shall be held as a reserve against the Revolving L/C Exposures and payment
obligations in respect of Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extensions, shall be the
property of such Lender, shall not constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim
of or against any Loan Party and shall not give rise to any obligation on the
part of the U.S. Borrower to pay interest to such Lender, it being agreed that
the reimbursement obligations in respect of (x) Letters of Credit shall arise
only at such

<PAGE>

                                                                             196

times as drawings are made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.05, and (y)
disbursements under any Ancillary Facility shall arise only at such time as
payments are required under such Ancillary Facility.

                  (b) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing
shall be made in respect of a Letter of Credit or any payment shall be made in
respect of an Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension, the Administrative Agent
shall, at the request of the applicable Issuing Bank or Ancillary Lender, as
applicable, withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender any amounts, up to
the amount of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment, deposited
in respect of such Letter of Credit or Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension and
remaining on deposit and deliver such amounts, in the case of a Letter of
Credit, to such Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders under Section 2.05(d) (but not of the U.S.
Borrower under Section 2.05(e)) or, in the case of an Unfunded Ancillary Credit
Extension, to the applicable Ancillary Lender. In the event that any U.S.
Revolving Facility Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount
to the Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 11.02, the applicable
Issuing Bank shall have a claim against such U.S. Revolving Facility Lender to
the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section
2.05(d), but shall have no claim against any other Lender in respect of such
defaulted amount, notwithstanding the exchange of interests in the applicable
Borrower's reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 11.01. Each other
Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting U.S. Revolving Facility Lender
for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default, including, in the
event that such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the
defaulted amount.

                  (c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter
of Credit shall expire undrawn, or an Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension shall
expire without requiring payment, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from
the Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in
respect of such Letter of Credit, or Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension, as
applicable, and distribute such amount to such Lender.

                  (d) With the prior written approval of the Administrative
Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld), any Lender may withdraw the amount held
in its Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount of any Letter of Credit
or Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension. Any Lender making such a withdrawal
shall be unconditionally obligated, in the event there shall

<PAGE>

                                                                             197

subsequently be a drawing under such Letter of Credit or payment in respect of
an Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension, to pay over to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the Issuing Bank or Ancillary Lender, as applicable, on
demand, its CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment.

                  (e) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from
its Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the Administrative
Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the
Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest
such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its
amounts in its Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (d) above shall have the
right, at intervals reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent, to
withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the Administrative Agent with
amounts in its Reserve Account and to retain such earnings for its own account.

            SECTION 11.03. Existing Credit Agreement; Effectiveness of Third
Amendment and Restatement. Until this Agreement becomes effective in accordance
with the terms of the Third Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the Existing
Credit Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected
hereby. After the Restatement Effective Date, all obligations of the Borrowers
under the Existing Credit Agreement shall become obligations of the Borrowers
hereunder, secured by the Security Documents, and the provisions of the Existing
Credit Agreement shall be superseded by the provisions hereof.
