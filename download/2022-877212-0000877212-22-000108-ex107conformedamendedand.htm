For all  purposes of this Agreement, if on any date of determination a Letter of Credit has expired by its  terms but any amount may still be drawn thereunder by any reason of the operation of Rule 3.14  of the ISP, such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be &#8220;outstanding&#8221; in the amount so remaining  available to be drawn.  </FONT></DIV>

In furtherance of the foregoing and without  limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that  appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing  Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without  responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or  refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict  compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and any such acceptance or refusal shall be  deemed not to constitute bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  (h) Disbursement Procedures.  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt  thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of  Credit.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Revolving Facility Administrative Agent and  the U.S. Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will  make an LC Disbursement thereunder, provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such  notice shall not relieve the U.S. Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the  Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement in accordance with Section 2.05(e).  (i) Interim Interest.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless  the U.S. Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full as set forth in Section 2.05(e),  the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the first Business  Day after receipt of notice to but excluding the date that the U.S. Borrower reimburses such LC  Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if  the U.S. Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.05(e),  then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.

(j) Role of Issuing Bank.  Each Lender and the U.S. Borrower agree that, in paying  any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain  any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the  Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or  the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the Issuing Bank,  the Revolving Facility Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any  correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any  action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving  Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of  gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or  enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit  Application.

(k) Replacement of the Issuing Bank.  The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time  by written agreement among the U.S. Borrower, the Revolving Facility Administrative Agent, the  replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Revolving Facility Administrative  Agent shall notify the Lenders of any replacement of an Issuing Bank.  At the time any such  replacement shall become effective, the U.S. Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the  account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(c).  From and after the effective  date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and  obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued  thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term &#8220;Issuing Bank&#8221; shall be deemed to refer to such  successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as  the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing  Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an  Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such  replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

The U.S. Borrower hereby acknowledges that the  issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the U.S. Borrower and/or any Subsidiaries of the  U.S. Borrower inures to the benefit of the U.S. Borrower, and that the U.S. Borrower&#8217;s business  derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.  (m) Applicability of ISP and UCP.  Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing  Bank and the U.S. Borrower, when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement  applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter  of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most  recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance, shall apply  to each commercial Letter of Credit  (n) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application.  In the event of any inconsistency  between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of  letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the U.S. Borrower to, or entered into  by the U.S. Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and  conditions of this Agreement shall control, and any grant of a security interest in any form of Letter  of Credit Application or other agreement shall be null and void.

If, after the date hereof,  there shall be more than one tranche of Revolving Commitments, and if the maturity date in respect  of any tranche of Revolving Commitments occurs prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit,  then (i) if one or more other tranches of Revolving Commitments in respect of which the maturity  date shall not have occurred are then in effect, such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed  to have been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Revolving Lenders to purchase  participations therein and to make Revolving Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to  </FONT></DIV>

If, for any  reason, such Cash Collateral is not provided or the reallocation does not occur, the Revolving  Lenders under the maturing tranche shall continue to be responsible for their participating interests  in the Letters of Credit.  Except to the extent of reallocations of participations pursuant to clause  (i) of the second preceding sentence, the occurrence of a maturity date with respect to a given  tranche of Revolving Commitments shall have no effect upon (and shall not diminish) the  percentage participations of the Revolving Lenders in any Letter of Credit issued before such  maturity date.

The applicable  Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the applicable Borrower by wire transfer  of the amounts so received, in immediately available funds, to an account of such Borrower, in  each case designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, provided that ABR  Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in  Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Revolving Facility Administrative Agent to the Issuing  Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.05(e) to  reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests  may appear.

In such event, after giving  effect to the reallocations pursuant to Section 2.22(a)(iv), if a Lender has not in fact made its share  of the applicable Borrowing available to the applicable Administrative Agent, then the applicable  Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to such Administrative Agent, within  three (3) Business Days of written notice, such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for  each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but  excluding the date of payment to such Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender,  (A) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate  and a rate determined by such Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on  interbank compensation and (B) if such Borrowing is denominated in an Alternative Currency, the  rate reasonably determined in accordance with customary practices by the Revolving Facility  Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount, or (ii) in the case of such  Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.

Section 3.08 Investment Company Status.

With respect to each Foreign Pension Plan, reserves have been  established in the financial statements furnished to Lenders in respect of any unfunded liabilities  in accordance with applicable law and prudent business practice or, where required, in  accordance with ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Pension  Plan is maintained.  The aggregate unfunded liabilities with respect to such Foreign Pension  Plans would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; the present value  of the aggregate accumulated benefit liabilities of all such Foreign Pension Plans (based on those  assumptions used to fund each such Foreign Pension Plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation  date applicable thereto, exceed by more than $50,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of  all such Foreign Pension Plans.

Section 5.12 Designation of Subsidiaries.    (a) The U.S. Borrower may designate (or re-designate) any Restricted Subsidiary  (other than the U.K. Borrower) as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a  Restricted Subsidiary; provided that immediately before and after such designation, no Event of  Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

For purposes hereof, a Lender&#8217;s &#8220;pro rata share&#8221; shall be determined  based upon (i) in the case of unpaid amounts owing to the Revolving Facility Administrative  Agent, its share of the aggregate Revolving Exposures and unused Revolving Commitments at the  time, (ii) in the case of unpaid amounts owing to the Tranche A Term Loan Administrative Agent,  its share of the outstanding Tranche A-1 Term Loans and Tranche A-2 Term Loans and unused  Tranche A-1 Term Commitments and Tranche A-2 Term Commitments at the time and (iii) in the  case of unpaid amounts owing to the Issuing Bank in respect of any Letter of Credit, its share of  the aggregate U.S. Revolving Exposure and unused Revolving Commitments at such time.  The  obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph (c) are subject to the last sentence of Section  2.02(a) (which shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Lenders&#8217; obligations under this paragraph (c)).  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Borrowers, any Agent, any  Lender, the Swingline Lender, the Issuing Bank, any other party hereto or any Indemnitee shall  assert, and each such Person hereby waives and releases, any claim against any other such Person,  on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to  direct or actual damages) (whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract, tort or duty  imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out of, in connection with, arising out of, as  a result of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated  hereby or referred to herein, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or any act or  omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and each such Person further agrees not to  sue upon any such claim or any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known  or suspected to exist in its favor; provided that the foregoing shall in no event limit the U.S.  Borrower&#8217;s indemnification obligations under clause (b) above.  (e) In case any proceeding is instituted involving any Indemnitee for which  indemnification is to be sought hereunder by such Indemnitee, then such Indemnitee will promptly  notify the U.S. Borrower of the commencement of any proceeding; provided, however, that the  failure to do so will not relieve the U.S. Borrower from any liability that it may have to such  Indemnitee hereunder, except to the extent that the U.S. Borrower is materially prejudiced by such  failure.  Notwithstanding the above, following such notification, the U.S. Borrower may elect in  writing to assume the defense of such proceeding, and, upon such election, the U.S. Borrower will  not be liable for any legal costs subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee (other than reasonable  costs of investigation and providing evidence) in connection therewith, unless (i) the U.S.  Borrower has failed to provide counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee in a timely  manner, (ii) counsel provided by the U.S. Borrower reasonably determines its representation of  such Indemnitee would present it with a conflict of interest or (iii) the Indemnitee reasonably  determines that there are actual conflicts of interest between the U.S. Borrower and the Indemnitee,  </FONT></DIV>
