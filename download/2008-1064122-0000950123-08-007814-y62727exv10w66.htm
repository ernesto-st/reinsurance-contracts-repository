or attempted breach. The Employee hereby consents to the grant of an injunction (temporary or
otherwise) against the Employee or the entry of any other court order against the Employee
prohibiting and enjoining him from violating, or directing him to comply with any provision of
Section&nbsp;6. The Employee also agrees that such remedies shall be in addition to any and all
remedies, including damages, available to the Protected Parties against him for such breaches or
threatened or attempted breaches. In addition, without limiting the Protected Parties&#146; remedies for
any breach of any restriction on the Employee set forth in Section&nbsp;6, except as required by law,
the Employee shall not be entitled to any payments set forth in Section&nbsp;5.2 hereof if the Employee
has breached the covenants applicable to the Employee contained in Section&nbsp;6, the Employee will
immediately return to the Protected Parties any such payments previously received under Section&nbsp;5.2
upon such a breach, and, in the event of such breach, the Protected Parties will have no obligation
to pay any of the amounts that remain payable by the Company under Section&nbsp;5.2.
