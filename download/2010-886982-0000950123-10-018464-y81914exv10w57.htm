<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> Award(s) (the &#147;Award(s)&#148;) that I have been granted by the Firm (as defined in the

the SIP and the Award Agreement(s), including but not limited to, the requirement that disputes
relating to the Award(s) and the Award Agreement(s) be decided through arbitration in New York City
and be governed by New York law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a condition of this grant, I understand that the Award(s) (as well as any other award that the
Firm may grant to me under the SIP) is/are subject to other governing law provisions (as outlined
in this signature card, in the current or otherwise then current Award Summary (as defined below)
or otherwise as may be required under applicable law) and, as a condition to receiving such awards,
I agree to be bound thereby. I also understand that the Firm may grant to me other awards under the
SIP that also may contain (among other terms and conditions) arbitration and other governing law
provisions and, as a condition to receiving such awards, I agree to be bound thereby. As a
condition of this grant, I agree to provide upon request an appropriate certification regarding my
U.S. tax status on Form W-8BEN, Form W-9, or other appropriate form, and I understand that failure
to supply a required form may result in the imposition of backup withholding on certain payments I
receive pursuant to this grant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, as a condition of this grant, if I am a person who has worked in the <U>United
Kingdom</U> at any time during the earnings period relating to any award under the SIP, as
determined by the Firm, when requested and as directed by the Firm, I will agree to a Joint
Election under s431 ITEPA 2003 of the laws of the United Kingdom for full or partial disapplication
of Chapter&nbsp;2 Income Tax (Earnings and Pension) Act 2003 under the laws of the United Kingdom and
will sign and return such election in respect of all future deliveries of shares underlying the
Award(s) and any previous grants made to me under the SIP and understand that the Firm intends to
meet its delivery obligations in shares with respect to my Award(s), except as may be prohibited by
law or described in the accompanying Award Agreement or supplementary materials.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If I have worked in <U>Switzerland</U> at any time during the earnings period relating to the

Firm with the Federal and/or Zurich/Geneva cantonal/communal tax authorities or as otherwise
directed by the Firm, and (ii)&nbsp;I hereby agree to be bound by any rulings agreed by the Firm in
respect of any Award(s), which is expected to result in taxation at the time of delivery of shares
(or cash or other property in lieu thereof), and (iii)&nbsp;I undertake to declare and make a full and
accurate income tax declaration in respect of my Award(s) in accordance with the above ruling or as
directed by the Firm.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">I understand and acknowledge that any transfer provisions (including, where applicable, escrow and
other similar provisions, but specifically excluding any transfer restrictions imposed on any
Award(s) in the Award Agreement(s) or the SIP) in the SIP or related documents will not apply to me
(i)&nbsp;to the extent that the applicability of those provisions would affect the availability of
relevant exemptions or tax favorable treatment, or (ii)&nbsp;otherwise in circumstances determined by
the Firm in its sole discretion.

employing entity, and implementation of the Notice Policy does not create an employment

my base salary and will continue to receive all mandatory benefits during the notice period. I
understand that during my notice period I may (subject to any applicable laws to the contrary) be

certain legal and equitable rights and remedies, including, without limitation, the forfeiture of
the Award(s) and any other awards granted to me (whether before or after the Award(s)) under the
SIP. The forfeiture of such Award(s) will also apply where I fail to give the full amount of notice
by exercising any right I may have under applicable legislation to make a payment in lieu of such
notice. I also understand that, if I fail to comply with the Notice Policy, the Firm may be
entitled to an injunction from a court restraining me from violating it.

the Award(s) and any prior awards under the SIP), both during and following my employment with the
Firm.

(successor in interest to Mellon Bank, N.A.) open a custody account for me as described in the
enclosed Custody Agreement among BNY Mellon (as successor in interest to Mellon Bank N.A.), The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and myself. I have received and agree to be bound by the Custody
Agreement (or any other such custody agreement previously entered into by me or on my behalf),
including the applicable restrictions on transfers, pledges and withdrawals of Common Stock, the
provisions permitting the Firm to monitor my custody account, and the limitations on the liability
of BNY Mellon and the Firm. I also agree to open an account with any other custodian or broker
selected by the Firm, if the Firm, in its sole discretion, requires me to open an account with such
custodian or broker as a condition to delivery of shares (or cash or other property) underlying the
Award(s).

Security, or similar contributions) in connection with the Award(s) (or does so in the future), and
if I have not signed a separate loan agreement governing repayment, I authorize the Firm to
withhold from my compensation any amounts required to reimburse it for any such advance or loan to
the extent permitted by applicable law.

certain circumstances), any outstanding amounts that I then owe the Firm against its delivery
obligations under the Award(s) or against any other amounts the Firm then owes me. I understand
that the delivery of shares pursuant to the Award(s) is conditioned on my satisfaction of any
applicable taxes or social security contributions (collectively referred to as &#147;tax&#148; or &#147;taxes&#148; for
purposes of the SIP and all related documents) in accordance with the SIP. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, the Firm, in its sole discretion, may require me to provide amounts equal to all
or a portion of any Federal, State, local, foreign or other tax obligations imposed on me or the
Firm in connection with the grant, vesting or delivery of the Award(s) by requiring me to choose
between remitting such amount (i)&nbsp;in cash (or through payroll deduction or otherwise) or (ii)&nbsp;in
the form of proceeds from the Firm&#146;s executing a sale of shares delivered to me pursuant to the
Award(s). However, in no event shall any such choice or the choice specified in paragraph 6, below,
determine, or give me any discretion to affect, the timing of the delivery of shares or payment of
tax obligations. I understand and agree that the Firm may reduce any year-end cash bonus that I may
receive by an amount equal to the estimated Indian Fringe Benefit Tax applicable to any award
(whether or not vested), as determined by the Firm in its sole discretion.

Firm&#146;s <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> fiscal year), I acknowledge and agree that the Firm may, in its sole discretion,
require (to the extent permitted by applicable law) that I provide for a reserve in an amount the
Firm determines is advisable or necessary in connection with any actual, anticipated or potential
tax consequences related to my separate employment contracts by requiring me to choose between
remitting such amount (i)&nbsp;in cash (or through payroll deductions or otherwise) or (ii)&nbsp;in the form
of proceeds from the Firm&#146;s executing a sale of shares delivered to me pursuant to the Award(s) (or
any other of my awards outstanding under the SIP).

notices and information that the Firm is required by law to send to me in connection therewith
including, without limitation, any document (or part thereof) constituting part of a prospectus
covering securities that have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the

document in physical form are hereby revoked and superseded. I agree to check Goldman Sachs&#146;

and I may agree) periodically as I deem appropriate for any new notices or information concerning
the SIP. I understand that I am not required to consent to the receipt of such documents in
electronic form in order to receive the Award(s) and that I may decline to receive such documents
in electronic form by contacting Equity Compensation (division of HCM), 30 Hudson Street, 35th
