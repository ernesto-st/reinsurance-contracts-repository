                                   WITNESSETH:

        WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company has agreed
to cede, and Life Re has agreed to assume and accept, a combination of
coinsurance and modified coinsurance coverage of certain variable annuity and
variable life insurance risks (the "Risks") with respect to the specified
original policy forms issued by the Company (each, a "Reinsured Contract" and,
taken together, the "Reinsured Contracts"); and

        WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company has
requested that the scope of the reinsurance provided thereby be expanded to
include certain new products to be issued by the Company effective October 1,
2001; and

         WHEREAS, Life Re is amenable to such expansion of the terms of
reinsurance provided by the Agreement;

         WHEREAS, accordingly, the Company and Life Re have agreed to amend the
Agreement as set forth herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
herein contained, the parties to this Amendment No. 1 do hereby agree as
follows:

         1. New Products. Schedules A and B of the Agreement are deleted in
their entirety and replaced with the attached amended and restated Schedules A
and B.

         2. Enhancements. Article 1, Section 6 of the Agreement is amended and
modified by adding the following words to the end of such provision:

      "In no event shall Life Re participate in punitive, compensatory or bad
      faith damages as may be awarded against the Company or any agent or
      affiliate thereof as a result of any act, omission or course of conduct
      committed by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the marketing,
      placement, performance or administration of the policies reinsured
      hereunder."

         3. Compliance with Law. Article XI of the Agreement is amended and
modified by adding thereto a new Section 13 as set forth below:

      "13.     Compliance with Law

     The Company represents and warrants that it understands the requirements of
the
<PAGE>
insurance, securities/investment and taxation laws or regulations of the
jurisdictions in which it will operate with respect to the Reinsured Contracts
and further, acknowledges that it is responsible for compliance with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to, any such
federal, state or local laws rules, rules or regulations of any jurisdiction
pertaining to (i) the design, marketing, issuance, management or administration
of the Reinsured Contracts, (ii) taxation (including, without limitation,
withholding obligations with respect thereto) by any jurisdiction of amounts
earned with respect to the Reinsured Contracts, (iii) currency restrictions or
limitations applicable with respect to the source of funds for, or the
disposition of proceeds from, the Reinsured Contracts, including, without

of 2001; and further, that it now has and shall maintain during the term of this
Agreement the licenses, permits and authorizations necessary or appropriate to
the conduct of its business. The Company shall be solely responsible for any
damages, fines, penalties, loss, liability, cost or expense incurred thereby,
and shall fully indemnify and hold Swiss Re and its Affiliates harmless in
respect of, all damages, fines, penalties, loss, liability, cost or expense
incurred by Swiss Re or any affiliate thereof which Swiss Re or any such
affiliate may incur, arising out of or relating to the Company's failure to
comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation or failure to properly
maintain required licensure."

         4. Other Reinsurance. Article I, Section 4 of the Agreement is modified
and amended by adding the following words to the end of such provision:

            It is understood and agreed that the coinsurance and modified
            coinsurance provided hereby is net of such inuring other reinsurance
            (i) whether or not collected or collectible by the Company and (ii)
            whether or not maintained in force or continued by the Company. In
            the event that the Company shall fail to maintain in force such
            Other Reinsurance as currently in effect, or otherwise on terms
            acceptable to Life Re, Life Re's liability and obligation hereunder
            shall be modified to place Life Re fully in the same position as if
            such Other Reinsurance had been so maintained and performed.

         5. Exclusion of Certain Benefits.

        (a) Article I, Section 3 of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following:

        Life Re will reinsure a quota share of each Reinsured Contract as set
        out in Schedule A provided, however, that for purposes of Article II and
        Article IV, Sections 2, 4, 5 and 6 hereof, Life Re shall not reinsure,
        and shall have no liability or obligation in respect of, and Life Re's
        Share (as hereinafter defined) shall be zero in respect of (i) any and
        every Other Reinsured Rider (as hereinafter defined) and (ii) except to
        the extent that any such loss, liability or obligation has been fully
        reinsured by virtue of the Other Reinsurance (as hereinafter defined),
        any loss, liability or obligation under or in respect of any Reinsured
        Contract arising out of any feature or element thereof providing a
        guaranteed minimum benefit thereunder determined without reference to
        the value of the investments supporting such Reinsured Contract (a
        "Guaranteed Element"). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Other
        Reinsured Rider" shall mean any rider, endorsement or addition to any of
        the Reinsured Contracts denoted as such on Schedule A hereto and
        including, without limitation, any such rider or endorsement to any of
        the Reinsured Contracts providing any guaranteed minimum benefits under
        the Reinsured


                                       3
<PAGE>
        Contracts in the event of any market decline, death, disability or other
        event.

        The share of each such Reinsured Contract so reinsured by Life Re is
        herein referred to as "Life Re's Share."

         6. Policyholder Charges for Other Reinsured Riders. Article IV, Section
4, Clause C of the Agreement is amended by adding to the end of the final
sentence thereof the words "and policyholder cost of the Other Reinsured
Riders."

         7. Effectiveness of this Amendment. This Amendment is to be effective
as of October 1, 2001. It is acknowledged that Life Re has subsequently been
renamed Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.

         8. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed simultaneously in any
number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which will constitute one and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and Life Re have executed this Amendment No. 1
on the dates set forth below.
