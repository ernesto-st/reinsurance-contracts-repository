            CREDIT AGREEMENT dated as of April 9, 1998, as amended and restated
as of April 12, 2001, among WKI HOLDING COMPANY, INC. (formerly known as CCPC
Holding Company, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the lending
institutions from time to time parties hereto (each a "Lender" and,

(such term and each other capitalized term used but not defined in this

Credit Agreement dated as of April 9, 1998, as amended and restated as of
November 15, 1999 and in effect prior to the Restatement Date (the "Original
Credit Agreement").

            The Borrower has requested that the Original Credit Agreement be
amended and restated by this Agreement in order to (a) provide for certain
Lenders to make Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans in an amount at any time
outstanding not in excess of $25,000,000, the proceeds of which will be used for
working capital and general corporate purposes, (b) provide for the continuation

(c) provide for the other changes described herein. Proceeds of Tranche A
Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans have been and shall continue to be

      plus 1% and (c) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day
      plus 1/2 of 1%. Any change in the ABR due to a change in the Prime Rate,
      the Three-Month Secondary CD Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate
      shall be effective as of the opening of business on the effective day of
      such change in the Prime Rate, the Three-Month Secondary CD Rate or the
      Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

            "ABR Loan" shall mean each Loan bearing interest at the rate
      provided in Section 2.8(a) and, in any event, shall include all Swingline
      Loans.

            "ABR Revolving Credit Loan" shall mean any Revolving Credit Loan
      bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the ABR.

            "Acquired EBITDA" shall mean, with respect to any Acquired Entity or

      (a) income from continuing operations before income taxes and
      extraordinary items, (b) interest expense, (c) depreciation expense and

      definition of the term "Consolidated EBITDA".

            "Acquisition Subsidiary" shall mean (a) any Subsidiary of the
      Borrower that is formed or acquired after the Original Closing Date in
      connection with Permitted Acquisitions, provided that at such time (or

      Acquisition Subsidiary in a written notice to the Administrative Agent,
      (b) any Restricted Subsidiary on the Original Closing Date subsequently
      re-designated as an Acquisition Subsidiary by the Borrower in a written

      such re-designation (such net worth to be calculated without regard to any

      except as set forth in the parenthetical to clause (i), on a consolidated
      basis in accordance with GAAP, and (c) each Subsidiary of an Acquisition
      Subsidiary; provided, however, that (i) at the time of any written
      re-designation by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent of any

      Agent, provide for an appropriate allocation of tax liabilities and
      benefits.

            "Adjusted Total Revolving Credit Commitment" shall mean at any time

      Commitments of all Defaulting Lenders.

Agent shall promptly give each Lender written notice (or telephonic notice

Loans, of such Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the other matters
covered by the related Notice of Borrowing.

            (b) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Swingline Loans

            (c) Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in

            (d) Borrowings to reimburse Unpaid Drawings shall be made upon the
notice specified in Section 3.4(c).

            (e) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to

Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without
liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the
Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the
Borrower. In

Administrative Agent's record of the terms of any such telephonic notice.

            2.4 Disbursement of Funds. (a) No later than 12:00 Noon (New York
time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing (including Mandatory
Borrowings), each Lender will make available its pro rata portion, if any, of
each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below,
provided that all Swingline Loans shall be made available in the full amount
thereof by Chase no later than 2:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date requested.

            (b) Each Lender shall make available all amounts it is to fund under
any Borrowing in Dollars and immediately available funds to the Administrative

(except in the case of Mandatory Borrowings and Borrowings to repay Unpaid
Drawings) make available to the Borrower by depositing to the Borrower's account
at the Administrative Agent's Office the aggregate of the amounts so made
available in Dollars and the type of funds received. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any such
Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on
such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the
Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole
discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available
to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made
available same to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay
such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand
therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the
Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such
Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding
amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made
available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such
corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per
annum equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or
(ii) if paid by the Borrower, the then-applicable rate of interest, calculated
in accordance with Section 2.8, for the respective Loans.

            (c) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice
any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any
default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its
commitments hereunder).

            2.5 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower shall
repay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, (i) (A) on
the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date, the then-unpaid Tranche B Term Loans and

Loans, and (ii) (A) on the Tranche A Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the
then-unpaid Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans and (B) on the Tranche B Revolving
Credit Maturity Date, the then-unpaid Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans. The
Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of Chase, on

            (c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the
appropriate lending office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
lending office of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such lending office of such Lender
from time to time under this Agreement.

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to
Section 13.6, and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and
subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, whether such Loan is a Term Loan, a Revolving Credit Loan or a
Swingline Loan, the Type of each Loan made, the Tranche of each Loan and the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender or
Chase hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder
from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

            (e) The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts
maintained pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable


                                       32
<PAGE>

law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of
the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender
or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such Register or such
subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect
the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans
made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

            (f) The amortization schedules set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of
paragraph (b) of this Section do not reflect any adjustments for prepayments of
Tranche B Term Loans or Tranche C Term Loans made pursuant to the Original
Credit Agreement prior to the Restatement Date. It is hereby acknowledged and
agreed that all reductions of scheduled principal payments in respect of Tranche
B Term Loans or Tranche C Term Loans that were made pursuant to the Original
Credit Agreement as a result of prepayments made under the Original Credit
Agreement prior to the Restatement Date shall apply to reduce the applicable
scheduled principal payments set forth in this Agreement.

            2.6 Conversions and Continuations. (a) The Borrower shall have the
option on any Business Day to convert all or a portion equal to at least the
Minimum Borrowing Amount of the outstanding principal amount of Term Loans or
Revolving Credit Loans of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another
Type or to continue the outstanding principal amount of any Eurodollar Term
Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans as Eurodollar Term Loans or
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans, as the case may be, for an additional
Interest Period, provided that (i) no partial conversion of Eurodollar Term
Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans shall reduce the outstanding
principal amount of Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans
made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount,
(ii) ABR Loans may not be converted into Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar
Revolving Credit Loans if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the
date of the conversion and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders
have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversion,
(iii) Eurodollar Loans may not be continued as Eurodollar Term Loans or
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans for an additional Interest Period if a Default
or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the proposed continuation and
the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or
their sole discretion not to permit such continuation and (iv) Borrowings
resulting from conversions pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be limited in
number as provided in Section 2.2. Each such conversion or continuation shall be
effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at least three
Business Days' (or one Business Day's notice in the case of a conversion into
ABR Loans) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) (each a "Notice of Conversion or Continuation") specifying the Term
Loans or Revolving Credit Loans to be so converted or continued, the Type of
Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans to be converted or continued into and, if
such Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted into or continued
as Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans, the Interest
Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give
each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed conversion or
continuation affecting any of its Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans.

            (b) If any Default or Event of Default is in existence at the time
of any proposed continuation of any Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar
Revolving Credit Loans and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders
have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation,
such Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans shall be
automatically converted on the last day of the current Interest Period into ABR
Loans. If upon the expiration of any Interest Period in respect of Eurodollar
Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans, the Borrower has failed to
elect a new Interest Period to be


                                       33
<PAGE>

applicable thereto as provided in paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall be
deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing of Eurodollar Term Loans or
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans, as the case may be, into a Borrowing of ABR
Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.

            2.7 Pro Rata Borrowings. Each Borrowing of Term Loans or Revolving
Credit Loans under this Agreement shall be granted by the Lenders pro rata on
the basis of their then-applicable Commitments. It is understood that no Lender
shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to
make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans
provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other
Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder.

            2.8 Interest. (a) The unpaid principal amount of each ABR Loan shall
bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the
Applicable ABR Margin plus the ABR in effect from time to time.

            (b) The unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Term Loan or
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan shall bear interest from the date of the
Borrowing thereof until maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise)
at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the Applicable Eurodollar Margin
in effect from time to time plus the relevant Eurodollar Rate.

            (c) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or
(ii) any interest payable thereon shall not be paid when due (whether at the
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear
interest at a rate per annum that is (x) in the case of overdue principal, the
rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto plus 2% or (y) in the case of
any overdue interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the rate
described in Section 2.8(a) plus 2% from and including the date of such
non-payment to but excluding the date on which such amount is paid in full
(after as well as before judgment).

            (d) Interest on each Loan shall accrue from and including the date
of any Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be
payable (i) in respect of each ABR Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last day of
each March, June, September and December, (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar
Term Loan or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan, on the last day of each Interest
Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of
three months, on each date occurring at three-month intervals after the first
day of such Interest Period, (iii) in respect of each Loan (except, in the case
of prepayments, any ABR Loan), on any prepayment (on the amount prepaid), at
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on
demand.

            (e) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in
accordance with Section 5.5.

            (f) The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for
any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
relevant Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent clearly
demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

            2.9 Interest Periods. At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation in respect of the making of,
or conversion into or continuation as, a Borrowing of Eurodollar Term Loans or
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans (in the case of the initial Interest Period
applicable thereto) or prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York


                                       34
<PAGE>

time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period
applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving
Credit Loans, the Borrower shall have the right to elect by giving the
Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, which Interest Period
shall, at the option of the Borrower, be a one, two, three, six or (in the case
of Revolving Credit Loans, if available to all the Lenders making such loans as
determined by such Lenders in good faith based on prevailing market conditions)
a nine or twelve month period, provided that the initial Interest Period may be
for a period less than one month if agreed upon by the Borrower and the Agents.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:

               (a) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar
      Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans shall commence on the date
      of such Borrowing (including the date of any conversion from a Borrowing
      of ABR Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of
      such Borrowing shall commence on the day on which the next preceding
      Interest Period expires;

               (b) if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of Eurodollar
       Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans begins on the last
       Business Day of a calendar month or begins on a day for which there is no
       numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such
       Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day
       of the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;

               (c) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that
      is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
      succeeding Business Day, provided that if any Interest Period in respect
      of a Eurodollar Term Loan or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan would
      otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of the
      month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
      Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and

               (d) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest
       Period in respect of any Eurodollar Term Loan or Eurodollar Revolving
       Credit Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the applicable
       Maturity Date of such Loan.

            2.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that (x) in
the case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender shall have reasonably determined (which
determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive
and binding upon all parties hereto):

             (i) on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any
       Interest Period that, by reason of any changes arising on or after the
       Restatement Date affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and
       fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on
       the basis provided for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or

             (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or
       reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect
       to any Eurodollar Loans (other than any such increase or reduction
       attributable to taxes) because of (x) any change since the date hereof in
       any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or
       in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the
       introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline
       or order), such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official
       reserve requirements, and/or (y) other circumstances affecting the
       interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in such
       market; or


                                       35
<PAGE>

            (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar
       Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with
       any law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would
       conflict with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order
       not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith
       would not be unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result of a
       contingency occurring after the date hereof that materially and adversely
       affects the interbank Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice
(if by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Administrative
Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of
clause (i) above, Eurodollar Term Loans and Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans
shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent
notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist (which notice the
Administrative Agent agrees to give at such time when such circumstances no
longer exist), and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by the
Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit
Loans that have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower,
(y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender,
promptly after receipt of written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in
the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest
or otherwise as such Lender in its reasonable discretion shall determine) as
shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or
reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (it being agreed that a written
notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable
detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such
Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the
Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly
as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.

            (b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and
in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(iii)
shall) either (i) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then being made pursuant to
a Borrowing, cancel said Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic
notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the
Borrower was notified by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or
(ii) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three
Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender
to convert each such Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan and Eurodollar Term Loan
into an ABR Loan, provided that if more than one Lender is affected at any time,
then all affected Lenders must be treated in the same manner pursuant to this
Section 2.10(b).

            (c) If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law,
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by a Lender or its parent with any request or directive made or
adopted after the date hereof regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, association, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's or its parent's capital or assets as a consequence of such Lender's
commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or
its parent could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or


                                       36
<PAGE>

compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or its parent's policies
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, promptly after demand
by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
or its parent for such reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that
a Lender shall not be entitled to such compensation as a result of such Lender's
compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any
such law, rule or regulation as in effect on the date hereof. Each Lender, upon
determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant
to this Section 2.10(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the
Borrower, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the
calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to give any such
notice shall not, subject to Section 2.13, release or diminish any of the
Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section
2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice.

            2.11 Compensation. If (a) any payment of principal of any Eurodollar
Term Loan or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan is made by the Borrower to or for
the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Loan as a result of a payment or conversion pursuant to Section
2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 13.7, as a result of acceleration of the maturity of
the Loans pursuant to Section 11 or for any other reason, (b) any Borrowing of
Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans is not made as a
result of a withdrawn Notice of Borrowing, (c) any ABR Loan is not converted
into a Eurodollar Term Loan or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan as a result of a
withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation, (d) any Eurodollar Loan is not
continued as a Eurodollar Term Loan or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan as a
result of a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (e) any prepayment
of principal of any Eurodollar Term Loan or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loan is
not made as a result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1
or 5.2, the Borrower shall, after receipt of a written request by such Lender
(which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting
such amount), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any
amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or
expenses that such Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such payment,
failure to convert, failure to continue or failure to prepay, including, without
limitation, any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits)
actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Loan.

            2.12 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii),
2.10(a)(iii), 2.10(b), 3.5 or 5.4 with respect to such Lender, it will, if
requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy
considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans
affected by such event, provided that such designation is made on such terms
that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving
rise to the operation of any such Section. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall
affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any
Lender provided in Section 2.10, 3.5 or 5.4.

            2.13 Notice of Certain Costs. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10,
2.11, 3.5 or 5.4 is given by any Lender more than 180 days after such Lender has
knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving
rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional
amounts described in such Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to
compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be, for any
such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the giving of such notice to the
Borrower.

            SECTION 3. Letters of Credit.

            3.1 Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions herein set forth, the Borrower, at any time and from time to time on
or after the Restatement Date and prior to the L/C Maturity Date, may request
that the Letter of Credit Issuer issue for the account of the Borrower, a
standby letter of credit or sight trade letters of credit in such form as may be
approved by the Letter of Credit Issuer in its reasonable discretion. Each
Letter of Credit previously issued pursuant to the Original Credit Agreement
shall remain outstanding in accordance with the terms hereof and of such Letter
of Credit.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Letter of Credit shall be
issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the Letter of Credit
Outstanding at such time, would exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment then in
effect; (ii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which,
when added to the sum of (x) the Letter of Credit Outstanding at such time and
(y) the aggregate principal of all Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans and
Swingline Loans then outstanding, would exceed the Total Tranche A Revolving
Credit Commitment then in effect; (iii) each Letter of Credit shall have an
expiry date occurring no later than one year after the date of issuance thereof,
unless otherwise agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Letter of
Credit Issuer, provided that in no event shall such expiry date occur later than
the L/C Maturity Date; (iv) each Letter of Credit shall be denominated in
Dollars; and (v) no Letter of Credit shall be issued by the Letter of Credit
Issuer after it has received a written notice from the Borrower or any Lender
stating that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing until
such time as the Letter of Credit Issuer shall have received a written notice of
(x) rescission of such notice from the party or parties originally delivering
such notice or (y) the waiver of such Default or Event of Default in accordance
with the provisions of Section 13.1.

            (c) Upon at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent and
the Letter of Credit Issuer (which notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, on
any day, permanently to terminate or reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment in
whole or in part, provided that, after giving effect to such termination or
reduction, the Letter of Credit Outstanding shall not exceed the Letter of
Credit Commitment.

            3.2 Letter of Credit Requests. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires
that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account, it shall give the
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer at least five (or such
lesser number as may be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Letter
of Credit Issuer) Business Days' written notice thereof. Each notice shall be
executed by the Borrower and shall be in the form of Exhibit G (each a "Letter
of Credit Request"). The Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit copies of
each Letter of Credit Request to each Lender.

            (b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to
be a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the Letter of Credit may
be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section
3.1(b).

            3.3 Letter of Credit Participations. (a) Immediately upon the
issuance by the Letter of Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit, the Letter of
Credit Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Lender
that has a Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment (each such other Lender, in its
capacity under this Section 3.3, an "L/C Participant"), and each such L/C
Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased
and received from the Letter of Credit Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation (each an "L/C Participation"), to the
extent of such L/C Participant's Tranche A


                                       38
<PAGE>

Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each
substitute letter of credit, each drawing made thereunder and the obligations of
the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security
therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto (although Letter of Credit Fees will be
paid directly to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the L/C
Participants as provided in Section 4.1(b) and the L/C Participants shall have
no right to receive any portion of any Fronting Fees).

            (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the
Letter of Credit Issuer shall have no obligation relative to the L/C
Participants other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered
under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they appear to comply
on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken
or omitted to be taken by the Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection
with any Letter of Credit issued by it, if taken or omitted in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for the Letter of
Credit Issuer any resulting liability.

            (c) In the event that the Letter of Credit Issuer makes any payment
under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have repaid
such amount in full to the Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to Section 3.4(a),
the Letter of Credit Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and
each L/C Participant of such failure, and each L/C Participant shall promptly
and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
Letter of Credit Issuer, the amount of such L/C Participant's Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars
and in same day funds; provided, however, that no L/C Participant shall be
obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of
Credit Issuer its Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such
unreimbursed amount arising from any wrongful payment made by the Letter of
Credit Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions
constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of
Credit Issuer. If the Letter of Credit Issuer so notifies, prior to 11:00 A.M.
(New York time) on any Business Day, any L/C Participant required to fund a
payment under a Letter of Credit, such L/C Participant shall make available to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer such L/C
Participant's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the amount of such
payment on such Business Day in same day funds. If and to the extent such L/C
Participant shall not have so made its Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer, such L/C Participant agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer,
forthwith on demand, such amount, together with interest thereon for each day
from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer at the Federal Funds Effective
Rate. The failure of any L/C Participant to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its Tranche A Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not
relieve any other L/C Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its
Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any payment under such
Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no L/C
Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other L/C Participant to
make available to the Administrative Agent such other L/C Participant's Tranche
A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any such payment.

            (d) Whenever the Letter of Credit Issuer receives a payment in
respect of an unpaid reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative
Agent has received for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer any payments
from the L/C Participants pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Letter of Credit
Issuer shall pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to each L/C Participant that has paid its Tranche A


                                       39
<PAGE>

Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such reimbursement obligation, in
Dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal to such L/C Participant's share
(based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally funded by such L/C
Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all L/C Participants) of the
principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing
after the purchase of the respective L/C Participations.

            (e) The obligations of the L/C Participants to make payments to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect
to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim,
set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and
shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

                        (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this
            Agreement or any o of the other Credit Documents;

                        (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or
            other right that the Borrower may have at any time against a
            beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any
            Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be
            acting), the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, any
            Lender or other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement,
            any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any
            unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between
            the Borrower and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of
            Credit);

                        (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document
            presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
            fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
            therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

                        (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the
            performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit
            Documents; or

                        (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default;

provided, however, that no L/C Participant shall be obligated to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer its Tranche
A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of any unreimbursed amount arising from
any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer under a Letter of
Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross
negligence on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer.

            3.4 Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) The Borrower
hereby agrees to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer, by making payment to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds at the
Administrative Agent's Office, for any payment or disbursement made by the
Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit (each such amount so paid
until reimbursed, an "Unpaid Drawing") immediately after, and in any event on
the date of, such payment, with interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by
the Letter of Credit Issuer, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 5:00 P.M.
(New York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement, from and including
the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date the Letter of Credit Issuer
is reimbursed therefor, at a rate per annum that shall at all times be the
Applicable ABR Margin plus the ABR as in effect from time to time, provided
that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the Letter
of Credit Issuer prior to 10:00 A.M. on the date of such drawing that the
Borrower intends to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for


                                       40
<PAGE>

the amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Loans, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have given a Notice of Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent requesting that the Lenders make Tranche A Revolving Credit
Loans (which shall initially be ABR Loans) on the date on which such drawing is
honored in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and (ii) each Lender
shall, on such date, make Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans in an amount equal to
such Lender's pro rata portion of such Borrowing in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.4.

            (b) The Borrower's obligations under this Section 3.4 to reimburse
the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including, in each
case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to
payment that the Borrower or any other Person may have or have had against the
Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including in
its capacity as an L/C Participant), including, without limitation, any defense
based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit (each a
"Drawing") to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any
non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such
Drawing, provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse the
Letter of Credit Issuer for any wrongful payment made by the Letter of Credit
Issuer under the Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions
constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Letter of
Credit Issuer.

            (c) Each payment by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of
Credit shall constitute a request by the Borrower for an ABR Tranche A Revolving
Credit Loan in the amount of the Unpaid Drawing in respect of such Letter of
Credit. The Letter of Credit Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, by 10:00 A.M. (New York time) on any Business Day on which
the Letter of Credit Issuer intends to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit,
of (i) the Letter of Credit Issuer's intention to honor such drawing and (ii)
the amount of such drawing. Unless otherwise instructed by the Borrower by 10:30
A.M. (New York time) on such Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of such drawing and the amount of its Tranche A
Revolving Credit Loan to be made in respect thereof, and each Lender shall be
irrevocably obligated to make an ABR Tranche A Revolving Credit Loan to the
Borrower in the amount of its Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
of the applicable Unpaid Drawing by 12:00 noon (New York time) on such Business
Day by making the amount of such Tranche A Revolving Credit Loan available to
the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office. Such Tranche A
Revolving Credit Loans shall be made without regard to the Minimum Borrowing
Amount. The Administrative Agent shall use the proceeds of such Tranche A
Revolving Credit Loans solely for purpose of reimbursing the Letter of Credit
Issuer for the related Unpaid Drawing.

            3.5 Increased Costs. If after the Original Closing Date, the
adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or
any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or actual compliance by the Letter of Credit Issuer or
any L/C Participant with any request or directive made or adopted after the date
hereof (whether or not having the force of law), by any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency shall either (a) impose, modify or make applicable any
reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against letters of
credit issued by the Letter of Credit Issuer, or any L/C Participant's L/C
Participation therein, or (b) impose on the Letter of Credit Issuer or any L/C
Participant any other conditions affecting its obligations under this Agreement
in respect of Letters of Credit or L/C Participations therein or any Letter of
Credit or such L/C Participant's L/C Participation therein; and the result of
any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Letter of Credit Issuer or
such L/C Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating


                                       41
<PAGE>

in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant hereunder
(other than any such increase or reduction attributable to taxes) in respect of
Letters of Credit or L/C Participations therein, then, promptly after receipt of
written demand to the Borrower by the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C
Participant, as the case may be (a copy of which notice shall be sent by the
Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent),
the Borrower shall pay to the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Letter of Credit Issuer
or such L/C Participant for such increased cost or reduction, it being
understood and agreed, however, that the Letter of Credit Issuer or a L/C
Participant shall not be entitled to such compensation as a result of such
Person's compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply
with, any such law, rule or regulation as in effect on the date hereof. A
certificate submitted to the Borrower by the Letter of Credit Issuer or a L/C
Participant, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by
the Letter of Credit Issuer or such L/C Participant to the Administrative
Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of
such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Letter of Credit
Issuer or such L/C Participant as aforesaid shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower absent clearly demonstrable error.

            3.6 Successor Letter of Credit Issuer. The Letter of Credit Issuer
may resign as Letter of Credit Issuer upon 60 days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Letter of Credit
Issuer shall resign as Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement, then the
Borrower shall appoint from among the Lenders with Revolving Credit Commitments
a successor issuer of Letters of Credit, whereupon such successor issuer shall
succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Letter of Credit Issuer, and the
term "Letter of Credit Issuer" shall mean such successor issuer effective upon
such appointment. At the time such resignation shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay to the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer all accrued and
unpaid fees pursuant to Sections 4.1(c) and (d). The acceptance of any
appointment as the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder by a successor Lender shall
be in the sole discretion of such Lender and shall be evidenced by an agreement
entered into by such successor, in a form satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement,
such successor Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the previous
Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.
After the resignation of the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, the resigning
Letter of Credit Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have
all the rights and obligations of a Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit. After any retiring Letter of Credit Issuer's resignation as Letter of
Credit Issuer, the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Letter of Credit
Issuer shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it (a) while it was Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement or (b) at
any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit
Issuer.

            SECTION 4. Fees; Commitments.

            4.1 Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of each Lender having a Revolving Credit Commitment (in
each case pro rata according to the respective Commitments of all such Lenders),
a commitment fee, to the extent not already paid pursuant to the Original Credit
Agreement, for each day from and including the Original Closing Date to but
excluding the Final Date. Such commitment fee shall be payable in arrears (i) on
the last day of each March, June, September and December (for the three-month
period (or portion thereof) ended on such day for which no payment has been
received) and (ii) on the Final Date (for the period ended on such date for
which no payment has been received pursuant to


                                       42
<PAGE>

clause (i) above), and shall be computed for each day during such period at a
rate per annum equal to the Commitment Fee Rate in effect on such day on the
Available Commitments in effect on such day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any amounts to any Defaulting Lender
pursuant to this Section 4.1.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective Letter of
Credit Exposure, a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit that is a standby
letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit Fee"), for the period from and including
the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to but not including the
termination date of such Letter of Credit computed at the per annum rate for
each day equal to the Applicable Eurodollar Margin for Revolving Credit Loans
minus 0.125% per annum on the average daily Stated Amount of such Letter of
Credit. Such Letter of Credit Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears
on the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the date upon
which the Total Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment terminates and the Letter
of Credit Outstandings shall have been reduced to zero.

            (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Letter of Credit Issuer a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit
issued by it (the "Fronting Fee"), for the period from and including the date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit to but not including the termination date of
such Letter of Credit, computed at the rate for each day equal to 0.125% per
annum on the average daily Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. Such Fronting
Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each
March, June, September and December and on the date upon which the Total Tranche
A Revolving Credit Commitment terminates and the Letter of Credit Outstandings
shall have been reduced to zero.

            (d) The Borrower agrees to pay directly to the Letter of Credit
Issuer upon each issuance of, drawing under, and/or amendment of, a Letter of
Credit issued by it such amount as the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower
shall have agreed upon for issuances of, drawings under or amendments of,
letters of credit issued by it.

            (e) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Agents, on the Restatement Date, the fees in the amounts and on
the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower and the Agents. The
Administrative Agent agrees to pay to each Lender, on behalf of the Agents, for
each Lender's own account on the Restatement Date, the fees in the amounts and
on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Agents and such Lender.

            4.2 Voluntary Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) Upon at
least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of
the Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, without premium or penalty, on
any day, permanently to terminate or reduce the Tranche B Revolving Credit
Commitments in whole or in part, provided that (a) any such reduction shall
apply proportionately and permanently to reduce the Tranche B Revolving Credit
Commitment of each of the Lenders, (b) any partial reduction pursuant to this
Section 4.2(a) shall be in the amount of at least $1,000,000 and (c) after
giving effect to such termination or reduction and to any prepayments of the
Loans made on the date thereof in accordance with this Agreement, the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans shall not
exceed the Total Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment.

            (b) At any time after the Tranche B Revolving Credit Termination
Date, upon at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the


                                       43
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office (which notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), the
Borrower shall have the right, without premium or penalty, on any day,
permanently to terminate or reduce the Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments in
whole or in part, provided that (a) any such reduction shall apply
proportionately and permanently to reduce the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Commitment of each of the Lenders, (b) any partial reduction pursuant to this
Section 4.2 shall be in the amount of at least $1,000,000 and (c) after giving
effect to such termination or reduction and to any prepayments of the Loans made
on the date thereof in accordance with this Agreement, the sum of (i) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans
and the Swingline Loans and (ii) the Letter of Credit Outstandings shall not
exceed the Total Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment.

            4.3 Mandatory Termination of Commitments. (a) (i) The Tranche C Term
Loan Commitments terminated upon the making of the Tranche C Term Loans and (ii)
the Tranche B Term Loan Commitments terminated upon the making of Tranche B Term

at 5:00 P.M. (New York time) on the Tranche A Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

            (c) The Total Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment shall terminate
at 5:00 P.M. (New York time) on the Tranche B Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

            (d) The Swingline Commitment shall terminate at 5:00 P.M. (New York
time) on the Swingline Maturity Date.

            SECTION 5. Payments.

            5.1 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to
prepay Term Loans, Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans, without premium
or penalty, in whole or in part from time to time on the following terms and
conditions: (a) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) of its intent to make such prepayment, the amount of such
prepayment and (in the case of Eurodollar Term Loans and Eurodollar Revolving
Credit Loans) the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which made, which notice
shall be given by the Borrower no later than (i) in the case of Term Loans or
Revolving Credit Loans, 10:00 A.M. (New York time) one Business Day prior to, or
(ii) in the case of Swingline Loans, 10:00 A.M. (New York time) on, the date of
such prepayment and shall promptly be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to
each of the Lenders or Chase, as the case may be; (b) each partial prepayment of
any Borrowing of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall be in a multiple of
$100,000 and in an aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000 and each
partial prepayment of Swingline Loans shall be in a multiple of $100,000 and in
an aggregate principal amount of at least $100,000, provided that no partial
prepayment of Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans made
pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Eurodollar Term
Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an
amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for Eurodollar Term Loans or
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans; and (c) any prepayment of Eurodollar Term
Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1 on any
day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto shall be
subject to compliance by the Borrower with the applicable provisions of Section
2.11. Each prepayment in respect of either or both tranches of Term Loans
pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be (a) applied to Tranche B Term Loans or
Tranche C Term Loans in such manner as the Borrower may determine and (b)
applied to reduce Tranche B Repayment Amounts or Tranche C Repayment Amounts in
such order as the Borrower may determine. At the Borrower's election in
connection with any prepayment


                                       44
<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section 5.1, such prepayment shall not be applied to any Term
Loan or Revolving Credit Loan of a Defaulting Lender. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing provisions to the contrary, the Borrower may not prepay (x) Term Loans
pursuant to this Section 5.1 prior to the Tranche B Revolving Credit Termination
Date or (y) Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans or Swingline Loans if, after giving
effect to such prepayment, any Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans shall be
outstanding except, in the case of this clause (y), the Borrower may prepay
Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans in an amount equal to the Stated Amount of a
Letter of Credit that the Borrower has requested to be issued simultaneously
with such prepayment pursuant to Section 3.1.

            5.2 Mandatory Prepayments. (a) Loan Prepayments. (i) On each
occasion that a Prepayment Event occurs, the Borrower shall, within five
Business Days after the occurrence of such Prepayment Event, offer to prepay, in
accordance with paragraphs (c) and (e) below, the principal amount of Loans in
an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Prepayment Event.

            (ii) Not later than the date that is three months after the last day
of any fiscal year, the Borrower shall offer to prepay, in accordance with
paragraphs (c) and (e) below, the principal of Loans in an amount equal to 75%
of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year.

            (iii) Any amount to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 5.2(a) shall
be allocated pro rata among the Term Loans and the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Loans, provided that any prepayment of Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans pursuant
to this Section 5.2(a) shall result in the permanent reduction of the Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitments in the amount of such prepayment, and provided
further that if the amount allocated for the prepayment of Tranche A Revolving
Credit Loans exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Tranche A Revolving
Credit Loans outstanding at such time, then the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Commitments shall also be permanently reduced by the amount of such excess.

            (b) Aggregate Revolving Credit Outstandings. If on any date the sum
of the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans and
Swingline Loans and the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Outstandings (all
the foregoing, collectively, the "Aggregate Tranche A Revolving Credit
Outstandings") exceeds the Total Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment as then
in effect, the Borrower shall forthwith repay on such date the principal amount
of Swingline Loans and, after all Swingline Loans have been paid in full,
Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans, in an amount equal to such excess. If, after
giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Swingline Loans and Tranche A
Revolving Credit Loans, the Aggregate Tranche A Revolving Credit Outstandings
exceed the Total Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect, the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in cash equal to such
excess and the Administrative Agent shall hold such payment for the benefit of
the Lenders as security for the obligations of the Borrower hereunder
(including, without limitation, obligations in respect of Letter of Credit
Outstandings) pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in form
and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (which shall permit
certain investments in Permitted Investments satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, until the proceeds are applied to the secured obligations). If on any
date the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Revolving
Credit Loans exceeds the Total Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment as then in
effect, the Borrower shall forthwith repay on such date the principal amount of
Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans in an amount equal to such excess.

            (c) Application to Repayment Amounts. Each prepayment of Term Loans
required by Section 5.2(a) shall be initially allocated pro rata among the
Tranche B Term Loans


                                       45
<PAGE>

and the Tranche C Term Loans and shall be applied to reduce the applicable
Repayment Amounts in such order as the Borrower may determine. With respect to
each such prepayment, (i) the Borrower will, not later than the date specified
in Section 5.2(a) for offering to make such prepayment, give the Administrative
Agent telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing) requesting that the
Administrative Agent provide notice of such prepayment to each Term Loan Lender,
(ii) each Term Loan Lender will have the right to refuse any such prepayment by
giving written notice of such refusal to the Borrower within fifteen Business
Days after such Lender's receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent of such
prepayment (and the Borrower shall not prepay any such Term Loans until the date
that is specified in the immediately following clause), (iii) the Borrower will
make all such prepayments not so refused upon the earlier of (x) such fifteenth
Business Day and (y) such time as the Borrower has received notice from each
Lender that it consents to or refuses such prepayment and (iv) any prepayment so
refused may be retained by the Borrower.

            (d) Application to Term Loans. With respect to each prepayment of
Term Loans required by Section 5.2(a), the Borrower may designate the Types of
Loans that are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which
made, provided that (i) Eurodollar Term Loans may be designated for prepayment
pursuant to this Section 5.2 only on the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto unless all Eurodollar Term Loans with Interest Periods ending
on such date of required prepayment and all ABR Term Loans have been paid in
full; and (ii) if any prepayment of Eurodollar Term Loans made pursuant to a
single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Term Loans made pursuant to such
Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for Eurodollar
Term Loans, such Borrowing shall immediately be converted into ABR Loans. In the
absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence,
the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in
its reasonable discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage
costs owing under Section 2.11.

            (e) Application to Revolving Credit Loans. With respect to each
prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans required by Section 5.2(a) or 5.2(b), the
Borrower may designate the Types of Loans that are to be prepaid and the
specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which made, provided that (i) Eurodollar
Revolving Credit Loans may be designated for prepayment pursuant to this Section
5.2 only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto unless all
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans with Interest Periods ending on such date of
required prepayment and all ABR Loans have been paid in full; (ii) if any
prepayment of Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to a single
Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to
such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for
Eurodollar Revolving Credit Loans, such Borrowing shall immediately be converted
into ABR Loans; (iii) each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing
shall be applied pro rata among such Loans; and (iv) notwithstanding the
provisions of the preceding clause (iii), no prepayment made pursuant to Section
5.2(a) or 5.2(b) of Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied to the Revolving
Credit Loans of any Defaulting Lender. In the absence of a designation by the
Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall,
subject to the above, make such designation in its reasonable discretion with a
view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section 2.11.

            (f) Eurodollar Interest Periods. In lieu of making any payment
pursuant to this Section 5.2 in respect of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the
last day of the Interest Period therefor, so long as no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower at its option may
deposit with the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the amount of the
Eurodollar Loan to be prepaid and such Eurodollar Loan shall be repaid on the
last day of the Interest Period therefor in the required amount. Such deposit
shall be held by the


                                       46
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent in a corporate time deposit account established on terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, earning interest at the
then-customary rate for accounts of such type. Such deposit shall constitute
cash collateral for the Obligations, provided that the Borrower may at any time
direct that such deposit be applied to make the applicable payment required
pursuant to this Section 5.2.

            (g) Minimum Amount. No prepayment shall be required pursuant to
Section 5.2(a)(i) unless and until the amount at any time of Net Cash Proceeds
from Prepayment Events required to be applied at or prior to such time pursuant
to such Section and not yet applied at or prior to such time to prepay Loans or
reduce Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to such Section exceeds
$2,500,000 in the aggregate.

            (h) Foreign Asset Sales. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Section 5.2, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of
any asset sale by a Restricted Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to an Asset Sale
Prepayment Event (a "Foreign Asset Sale") are prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of
such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to repay
Loans at the times provided in this Section 5.2 but may be retained by the
applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the
applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (the
Borrower hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Restricted Foreign Subsidiary
to promptly take all actions required by the applicable local law to permit such
repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash
Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be
immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be promptly
(and in any event not later than two Business Days after such repatriation)
applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result
thereof) to the repayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 5.2 and (ii) to
the extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of
any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Asset Sale would have a
material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds,
the Net Cash Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Restricted
Foreign Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of this clause (ii), on or before
the date on which any Net Cash Proceeds so retained would otherwise have been
required to be applied to reinvestments or prepayments pursuant to Section
5.2(a), (x) the Borrower applies an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds to
such reinvestments or prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds had been received
by the Borrower rather than such Restricted Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount
of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net
Cash Proceeds had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Cash Proceeds that
would be calculated if received by such Foreign Subsidiary) or (y) such Net Cash
Proceeds are applied to the repayment of Indebtedness of a Restricted Foreign
Subsidiary.

            5.3 Method and Place of Payment. (a) Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement shall be made,
without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders entitled thereto, the Letter of
Credit Issuer or Chase, as the case may be, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York
time) on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available funds and
in lawful money of the United States of America at the Administrative Agent's
Office, it being understood that written or facsimile notice by the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent to make a payment from the funds in the Borrower's
account at the Administrative Agent's Office shall constitute the making of such
payment to the extent of such funds held in such account. The Administrative
Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the same day (if payment was
actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to 2:00 P.M. (New York time)
on such day) like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or Fees
ratably to the Lenders entitled thereto.


                                       47
<PAGE>

             (b) Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 2:00
 P.M. (New York time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding
 Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be
 due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended
 to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal,
 interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in
 effect immediately prior to such extension.

            5.4 Net Payments. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this
Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding
for or on account of, any current or future income, stamp or other taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or
hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental
Authority, excluding (i) net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu
of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender and (ii)
any taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a
current or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and
the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any
such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender
having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment
under, or enforced, this Agreement). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded
Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary
to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all
Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the
rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any
Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a
state thereof if such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph
(b) of this Section 5.4. Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the
Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the
Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as
the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by
the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any
Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to
remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest, costs or penalties that may
become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such
failure. The agreements in this Section 5.4(a) shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

            (b) Each Lender that is not incorporated or organized under the laws
of the United States of America or a state thereof shall:

                        (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
            two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service Form
            1001 or Form 4224 or, in the case of Non-U.S. Lender claiming
            exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or
            881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest",
            a Form W-8, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto
            (and, if such Non-U.S. Lender delivers a Form W-8, a certificate
            representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank for purposes of
            Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within
            the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and
            is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower
            (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly
            completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S.


                                       48
<PAGE>

Lender claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal
withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement;

                        (ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
            Agent two further copies of any such form or certification on or
            before the date that any such form or certification expires or
            becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a
            change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the
            Borrower; and

                        (iii) obtain such extensions of time for filing and
            complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested
            by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent;

unless in any such case any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred
prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required that
renders any such form inapplicable or would prevent such Lender from duly
completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so
advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Each Person that shall become
a Participant pursuant to Section 13.6 or a Lender pursuant to Section 13.6
shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide
all the forms and statements required pursuant to this Section 5.4(b), provided
that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such
required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related participation
shall have been purchased.

            (c) The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S.
Lender, or to pay any additional amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of
U.S. Federal withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) above to the extent that
(i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to U.S. Federal withholding
tax existed on the date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement
(or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Participant, on the date such Participant became
a Participant hereunder); provided, however, that this clause (i) shall not
apply to the extent that (x) the indemnity payments or additional amounts any
Lender (or Participant) would be entitled to receive (without regard to this
clause (i)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or additional amounts that the
person making the assignment, participation or transfer to such Lender (or
Participant) would have been entitled to receive in the absence of such
assignment, participation or transfer, or (y) such assignment, participation or
transfer had been requested by the Borrower, (ii) the obligation to pay such
additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Non-U.S.
Lender or Non-U.S. Participant to comply with the provisions of paragraph (b)
above or (iii) any of the representations or certifications made by a Non-U.S.
Lender or Non-U.S. Participant pursuant to paragraph (b) above are incorrect at
the time a payment hereunder is made, other than by reason of any change in
treaty, law or regulation having effect after the date such representations or
certifications were made.

            (d) If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis
exists for contesting any taxes for which indemnification has been demanded
hereunder, the relevant Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall
cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such taxes at the Borrower's expense
if so requested by the Borrower. If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, receives a refund of a tax for which a payment has been made by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, which refund in the good faith judgment of
such Lender or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such
payment made by the Borrower, then the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such amount as the Lender or
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the
refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse
position than it would have been in if the payment had not been required. A
Lender or Administrative Agent shall claim any refund that it determines is
available to it, unless


                                       49
<PAGE>

it concludes in its reasonable discretion that it would be adversely affected by
making such a claim. Neither the Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be
obliged to disclose any information regarding its tax affairs or computations to
the Borrower in connection with this paragraph (d) or any other provision of
this Section 5.4.

            (e) Each Lender represents and agrees that, on the date hereof and
at all times during the term of this Agreement, it is not and will not be a
conduit entity participating in a conduit financing arrangement (as defined in
Section 7701(1) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) with respect to the
Borrowings hereunder unless the Borrower has consented to such arrangement prior
thereto.

            5.5 Computations of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest on Eurodollar
Loans and, except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, ABR Loans shall
be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.
Interest on ABR Loans in respect of which the rate of interest is calculated on
the basis of the Prime Rate and interest on overdue interest shall be calculated
on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual
days elapsed.

            (b) Fees and Letter of Credit Outstanding shall be calculated on the
basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days
elapsed.

            SECTION 6. Conditions Precedent to Amendment and Restatement.

            SECTION 7. Conditions Precedent to Credit Events. The agreement of
each Lender to make any Loan requested to be made by it on any date (excluding
Mandatory Borrowings) and the obligation of the Letter of Credit Issuer to issue
Letters of Credit on any date is subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions precedent:

            7.1 No Default; Representations and Warranties. At the time of each
Credit Event and also after giving effect thereto (a) there shall exist no
Default or Event of Default and (b) all representations and warranties made by
any Credit Party contained herein or in the other Credit Documents shall be true
and correct in all material respects with the same effect as though such

to an earlier date, in which


                                       51

making of each Revolving Credit Loan (other than any Revolving Credit Loan made

Total Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment at such time and (b) the outstanding
principal amount of Loans under the Borden Facility shall not be less
$25,000,000.

The acceptance of the benefits of each Credit Event shall constitute a
representation and warranty by each Credit Party to each of the Lenders that all
the applicable conditions specified above exist as of that time.

            SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements. In order to
induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement, to make and continue the Loans
and issue, maintain or participate in Letters of Credit as provided for herein,
the Borrower makes the following representations and warranties to, and
agreements with, the Lenders, all of which shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans and the issuance of the
Letters of Credit:

            8.1 Corporate Status. The Borrower and each Material Subsidiary (a)
is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or other entity in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
corporate or other organizational power and authority to own its property and
assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and (b) has duly
qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing in all
jurisdictions where it is required to be so qualified, except where the failure
to be so qualified could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

            8.2 Corporate Power and Authority. Each Credit Party has the
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and
provisions of the Credit Documents to which it is a party and has taken all
necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of the Credit Documents to which it is a party. Each Credit Party has duly
executed and delivered each Credit Document to which it is a party and each such
Credit Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Credit Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity.

            8.3 No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery and performance by
any Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party nor compliance
with the terms and provisions thereof and the other transactions contemplated
therein will (a) contravene any applicable provision of any material law,
statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree


                                       52
<PAGE>

of any court or governmental instrumentality, (b) result in any breach of any of
the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create
or impose) any Lien upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to, the terms of any material indenture
(including the Subordinated Note Indenture), loan agreement, lease agreement,
mortgage, deed of trust, agreement or other material instrument to which the
Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any
of its property or assets is bound or (c) violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or By-Laws of the Borrower or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries.

            8.4 Litigation. Except as set forth in the Borrower's audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings (including, without limitation, Environmental
Claims) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened with respect to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            8.5 Margin Regulations. Neither the making of any Loan hereunder nor
the use of the proceeds thereof will violate the provisions of Regulation T, U
or X of the Board.

            8.6 Governmental Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license,
authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or
exemption by, any Governmental Authority is required to authorize or is required
in connection with (a) the execution, delivery and performance of any Credit
Document or (b) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
Credit Document, except any of the foregoing the failure to obtain or make could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            8.7 Investment Company Act. The Borrower is not an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

            8.8 True and Complete Disclosure. (a) All factual information and
data (taken as a whole) heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by the
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective authorized
representatives in writing to the Administrative Agent and/or any Lender on or
before the Restatement Date (including, without limitation, (i) the Confidential
Information Memorandum and (ii) all information contained in the Credit
Documents) for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated herein was true and complete in all material respects
on the date as of which such information or data is dated or certified and was
not incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to make such
information and data (taken as a whole) not misleading at such time in light of
the circumstances under which such information or data was furnished, it being
understood and agreed that for purposes of this Section 8.8(a), such factual
information and data shall not include projections and pro forma financial
information.

            (b) The projections and pro forma financial information contained in
the information and data referred to in paragraph (a) above were based on good
faith estimates and assumptions believed by such Persons to be reasonable at the
time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such projections as to future
events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the period

public accountants, who delivered an unqualified opinion with respect thereto,
in each case present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial

thereby. All such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied except to the extent provided in the notes to said
financial statements. There has been no Material Adverse Change since December
31, 2000, other than solely as a result of changes in general economic
conditions.

            8.10 Tax Returns and Payments. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has filed all federal income tax returns and all other material tax
returns, domestic and foreign, required to be filed by it and has paid all
material taxes and assessments payable by it that have become due, other than
those not yet delinquent or contested in good faith. The Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries have paid, or have provided adequate reserves (in the good
faith judgment of the management of the Borrower) in accordance with GAAP for
the payment of, all material federal, state and foreign income taxes applicable
for all prior fiscal years and for the current fiscal year to the Restatement
Date.

the Code and any applicable Requirement of Law; no Reportable Event has occurred
(or is reasonably likely to occur) with respect to any Plan; no Plan is
insolvent or in reorganization (or is reasonably likely to be insolvent or in
reorganization), and no written notice of any such insolvency or reorganization
has been given to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate; no Plan
(other than a multiemployer plan) has an accumulated or waived funding
deficiency (or is reasonably likely to have such a deficiency); neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred (or is
reasonably likely expected to incur) any liability to or on account of a Plan
pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4069, 4201 or

writing that it will incur any liability under any of the foregoing Sections
with respect to any Plan; no proceedings have been instituted (or are reasonably
likely to be instituted) to terminate or to reorganize any Plan or to appoint a
trustee to administer any Plan, and no written notice of any such proceedings
has been given to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate; and no
lien imposed under the Code or ERISA on the assets of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate exists (or is reasonably likely to exist) nor
has the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate been notified in writing
that such a lien will be imposed on the assets of the Borrower, any Subsidiary
or any ERISA Affiliate on account of any Plan, except to the extent that a
breach of any of the foregoing representations, warranties or agreements in this
Section 8.11 would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in an amount of
liability that would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or
relates to any matter disclosed in the financial statements of the Borrower
contained in the Confidential Information Memorandum. No Plan (other than a
multiemployer plan) has an Unfunded Current Liability that would, individually
or when taken together with any other liabilities referenced in this Section
8.11, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to
Plans that are multiemployer plans (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), the
representations and warranties in this Section 8.11, other than any made with
respect to (a) liability under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA or (b) liability
for termination or reorganization of such Plans under ERISA, are made to the
best knowledge of the Borrower.

            8.12 Subsidiaries. Schedule 8.12 lists each Subsidiary of the
Borrower (and the direct and indirect ownership interest of the Borrower
therein), in each case existing on the Restatement Date. To the knowledge of the
Borrower, each Material Subsidiary as of the Restatement Date has been so

necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as currently
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, free and clear of all Liens (other

funds for any of the foregoing purposes, or permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration (other than in
connection with an investment permitted by Section 10.5) any shares of any class
of the capital stock of the Borrower, now or hereafter outstanding (or any
options or warrants or stock appreciation rights issued by such Person with
respect to its capital stock) (all of the foregoing "Dividends"), provided that,

effect thereto, (a) the Borrower may redeem in whole or in part any capital
stock of the Borrower (i) for the Replacement Preferred Stock, (ii) for another
class of capital stock or rights to acquire capital stock of the Borrower or
(iii) with proceeds from substantially concurrent equity contributions or


                                       67

issuances of new shares of capital stock, provided that such other class of
capital stock (other than any Replacement Preferred Stock) contains terms and
provisions at least as advantageous to the Lenders in all respects material to
their interests as those contained in the capital stock redeemed thereby, (b)
the Borrower may repurchase shares of its capital stock (and/or options or
warrants in respect thereof) held by its officers, directors and employees so
long as such repurchase is pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of,
management and/or employee stock plans, stock subscription agreements or
shareholder agreements in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000,000 in any
calendar year plus an additional $1,000,000 over the term of this Agreement, (c)
the Borrower may make investments permitted by Section 10.5 and (d) the Borrower

            (b) The Borrower will not waive, amend, modify, terminate or release
the Subordinated Loan Agreement, the Subordinated Note Indenture or the Borden

amendment or modification would be adverse to the Lenders in any material
respect, except for amendments to the Borden Facility the only effect of which
is to increase the aggregate commitment of the lenders thereunder to a principal
amount not exceeding $55,000,000.

            (c) The Borrower will not waive, amend, modify, terminate or release

            10.11 Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense Ratio.
The Borrower will not permit the Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest

<PAGE>

any fiscal year of the Borrower set forth below to exceed the amount set forth

                        Fiscal Year       Amount
                        -----------       ------

                           2001         50,000,000

                           2007         30,000,000

To the extent that Capital Expenditures made by the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries during any fiscal year are less than the maximum amount permitted
to be made for such fiscal year, such unused amount (each such amount, a
"carry-forward amount") may be carried forward to the immediately succeeding
fiscal year and utilized to make such Capital Expenditures in such succeeding
fiscal year in the event the amount set forth above for such succeeding fiscal
year has been used (it being understood and agreed that (a) no carry-forward
amount may be carried forward beyond the fiscal year immediately succeeding the
fiscal year in which it arose, (b) no portion of the carry-forward amount
available for any fiscal year may be used until the entire amount of such
Capital Expenditures permitted to be made in such fiscal year (without giving
effect to such carry-forward amount) shall be made and (c) no carry-forward
amount existing under the Original Credit Agreement from any period prior to
fiscal year 2001 may be utilized as a carry-forward amount hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
make Capital Expenditures in any fiscal year prior to 2007 that would cause the
aggregate amount of Capital Expenditures to exceed the maximum amount otherwise
permitted in such fiscal year (including any carry-forward amount) by an amount
not to exceed $10,000,000, provided that in such case, the maximum amount
permitted in the immediately following fiscal year shall be reduced by the
amount of such excess.

EBITDA for any Test Period ending during any period set forth below to be less

to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Credit Document or
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Neither the Syndication Agent
nor the Documentation Agent, in their respective capacities as such, shall have
any obligations, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement.

            12.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents by or through
agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall
not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

            12.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Credit Document (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for
any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower or
any Guarantor or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other
Credit Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or
in connection with, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any other Credit Document or for any failure of the Borrower
or any Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower.

            12.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register
with respect to any amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes
unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall
have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified


                                       74
<PAGE>

in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other
Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in
accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

            12.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or
the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders, provided that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders (except to the extent that
this Agreement requires that such action be taken only with the approval of the
Required Lenders or each of the Lenders, as applicable).

            12.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Borrower or any Guarantor, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and any Guarantor and made its
own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and any
Guarantor. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to
be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, assets,
operations, properties, financial condition, prospects or creditworthiness of
the Borrower or any Guarantor that may come into the possession of the
Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

            12.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so),
ratably according to their respective portions of the Total Credit Exposure in
effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is
sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and


                                       75
<PAGE>

the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their
respective portions of the Total Credit Exposure in effect immediately prior to
such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at
any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing, provided
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 12.7 shall
survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            12.8 Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and any Guarantor
as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder
and under the other Credit Documents. With respect to the Loans made by it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though
it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall
include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

            12.9 Successor Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as
Administrative Agent upon 20 days' prior written notice to the Lenders and the
Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, then the Required Lenders shall
appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which
successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the
rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such
appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers
and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of
the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of
this Section 12 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents.

            SECTION 13. Miscellaneous.

            13.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement nor any other
Credit Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or
modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1. The
Required Lenders may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the relevant
Credit Party or Credit Parties written amendments, supplements or modifications
hereto and to the other Credit Documents for the purpose of adding any
provisions to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or changing in any
manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or
(b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of
the requirements of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any Default
or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver
and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall directly (i) forgive any
portion of any Loan or


                                       76
<PAGE>

extend the final scheduled maturity date of any Loan or reduce the stated rate,
or forgive any portion, or extend the date for the payment, of any interest or
fee payable hereunder (other than as a result of waiving the applicability of
any post-default increase in interest rates) or extend the final expiration date
of any Lender's Commitment or extend the final expiration date of any Letter of
Credit beyond the L/C Maturity Date or increase the aggregate amount of the
Commitments of any Lender, in each case without the written consent of each
Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, or (ii) amend, modify or waive
any provision of this Section 13.1 or reduce the percentages specified in the
definitions of the terms "Required Lenders", "Required Revolving Credit
Lenders", "Required Term Loan Lenders" and "Required Tranche B Revolving Credit
Lenders", or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of its rights
and obligations under any Credit Document to which it is a party (except as
permitted pursuant to Section 10.3), in each case without the written consent of
each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, or (iii) amend, modify or
waive any provision of Section 12 without the written consent of the
then-current Agents, or (iv) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 3
without the written consent of the Letter of Credit Issuer, or (v) amend, modify
or waive any provisions hereof relating to Swingline Loans without the written
consent of Chase, or (vi) change any Revolving Credit Commitment to a Term Loan
Commitment, or change any Term Loan Commitment to a Revolving Credit Commitment,
in each case without the prior written consent of each Lender directly and
adversely affected thereby, or (vii) decrease any Repayment Amount or extend any
scheduled Repayment Date, in each case without the written consent of the
Required Term Loan Lenders, or (viii) except to the extent permitted under the
applicable Credit Document, release all or substantially all the Collateral
under the Pledge Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Mortgages or release
all or substantially all the Guarantors under the Guarantee, in each case
without the written consent of (x) the Required Revolving Credit Lenders (y) the
Required Term Loan Lenders and (z) each Tranche B Revolving Credit Lender or
(ix) change any provision of any Credit Document in a manner that by its terms
adversely affects the rights of Tranche B Revolving Credit Lenders to receive
prepayments on Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans and receive distributions in
respect of Collateral prior to Term Lenders and Tranche A Revolving Credit
Lenders without the written consent of each Tranche B Revolving Credit Lender,
or (x) (A) increase the limitation on asset sales in Section 10.4(b)(i), (B)
amend, modify or waive Section 10.7(b) with respect to the Borden Facility or
any commitment thereunder, or (C) amend, modify or waive any provision of
Section 10.7(d), in each case, without the written consent of the Required
Tranche B Revolving Credit Lenders. Any such waiver and any such amendment,
supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the affected Lenders
and shall be binding upon the Borrower, such Lenders, the Administrative Agent
and all future holders of the affected Loans. In the case of any waiver, the
Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their
former positions and rights hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, and
any Default or Event /of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing, it being understood that no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Credit Documents

any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

            13.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties made hereunder, in the other Credit Documents and in any
document, certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection

or reimburse the Agents for all their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution
of, and any amendment, supplement


                                       78
<PAGE>

or modification to, this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and any other
documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and
administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of
counsel to each Agent, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender and the
Administrative Agent for all its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under
this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any such other documents,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, disbursements and other
charges of counsel to each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent,
(c) to pay, indemnify, and hold harmless each Lender and the Administrative
Agent from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities
with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other
similar taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined to be payable in
connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration
of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or
modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this
Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any such other documents, and (d) to
pay, indemnify, and hold harmless each Lender and the Administrative Agent and
their respective directors, officers, employees, trustees and agents from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, reasonable and documented
fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel, with respect to the execution,
delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the
other Credit Documents and any such other documents, including, without
limitation, any of the foregoing relating to the violation of, noncompliance
with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of
the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Properties (all the
foregoing in this clause (d), collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"),
provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender nor any of their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents with respect to indemnified liabilities arising
from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be
indemnified or (ii) disputes among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and/or
their transferees. The agreements in this Section 13.5 shall survive repayment
of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            13.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments. (a) (i)
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower,
the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and
assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
Lender.

            (ii) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other
entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (including to loan derivative
counterparties in respect of swaps or similar arrangements having the practical
or economic effect thereof). In the event of any such sale by a Lender of a
participating interest to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such
Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender
shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes under this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents. In no event shall any Participant under any such participation have
any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Credit
Document, or any consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom, except
to


                                       79
<PAGE>

the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would directly forgive any
principal of any Loan or reduce the stated rate, or forgive any portion, or
postpone the date for the payment, of any interest or fee payable hereunder
(other than as a result of waiving the applicability of any post-default
increase in interest rates), or increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments
of any Lender or postpone the date of the final scheduled maturity of any Loan,
in each case to the extent subject to such participation. The Borrower agrees
that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due or unpaid, or shall
have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default, each Participant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent
as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a
Lender under this Agreement, provided that, in purchasing such participating
interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to share with the
Lenders the proceeds thereof as provided in Section 13.7 as fully as if it were
a Lender hereunder. The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 and 2.11 with respect to its
participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time as
if it were a Lender, provided that no Participant shall be entitled to receive
any greater amount pursuant to any such Section than the transferor Lender would
have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation
transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer
occurred.

                  (iii) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business
and in accordance with applicable law, at any time and from time to time assign
to any Lender or any Affiliate (with the consent of the Borrower if any
increased costs would result therefrom) thereof or an Approved Fund or, with the
consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which in each case shall
not be unreasonably withheld, it being understood that, without limitation, the
Borrower shall have the right to withhold its consent to any assignment if, in
order for such assignment to comply with applicable law, the Borrower would be
required to obtain the consent of, or make any filing or registration with, any
Governmental Authority), to an additional bank or fund that is regularly engaged
in making, purchasing or investing in loans or securities or financial
institution (an "Assignee") all or any part of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents pursuant to an Assignment and
Acceptance, substantially in the form of Exhibit I, executed by such Assignee,
such assigning Lender (and, in the case of an Assignee that is not then a Lender
or an Affiliate thereof, by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) and
delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the
Register, provided that, except in the case of an assignment of all of a
Lender's interests under this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, no such assignment to an Assignee (other
than any Lender or any Affiliate thereof) shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of less than $5,000,000. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein and
(y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining
portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such assigning Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the consent of the Borrower shall
not be required for any assignment that occurs at any time when any of the
events described in Section 11.5 shall have occurred and be continuing with
respect to the Borrower.

            (b) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or
assigning all or any portion of its Loans to any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with applicable law. In order to


                                       80
<PAGE>

facilitate such pledge or assignment, the Borrower hereby agrees that, upon
request of any Lender at any time and from time to time after the Borrower has
made its initial borrowing hereunder, the Borrower shall provide to such Lender,
at the Borrower's own expense, a promissory note, substantially in the form of
Exhibit E-1, E-2, E-3 or E-4, as the case may be, evidencing the Tranche B Term
Loans, Tranche A Revolving Credit Loans, Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans and
Tranche C Term Loans, respectively, owing to such Lender.

            (c) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall
maintain at the address of the Administrative Agent referred to in Section 13.2
a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the
"Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and
the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from
time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan
or other obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the
contrary. Any assignment of any Loan or other obligation hereunder shall be
effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the
Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any
Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

            (d) (i) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, in the case of an Assignee that is not
then a Lender or an Affiliate thereof, by the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent) together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and
processing fee of $3,500, the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept
such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) on the effective date determined
pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and
give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

            (e) Subject to Section 13.16, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant or Assignee (each, a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's
possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates that has been delivered to
such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which
has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection
with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to
becoming a party to this Agreement, provided that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall provide to any Transferee or prospective Transferee
any of the Confidential Information unless such person shall have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement in the form of Exhibit K.

            13.7 Replacements of Lenders Under Certain Circumstances. The
Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests
reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.12, 3.5 or 5.4, (b)
is affected in the manner described in Section 2.10(a)(iii) and as a result
thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to be taken or
(c) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank or other financial
institution, provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any
Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) the Borrower shall repay (or
the replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par) all Loans and other
amounts (other than any disputed amounts), pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.12,
3.5 or 5.4, as the case may be) owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date
of replacement, (iv) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a
Lender, and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (v) the replaced Lender shall be
obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section
13.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and
processing


                                       81
<PAGE>

fee referred to therein) and (vi) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be
a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

            13.8 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) Subject to Section 13.8(c), if any
Lender (a "benefitted Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or
part of its Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect
thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or
proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 11.5, or otherwise) (a "Set-Off
Benefit"), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral
received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans,
or interest thereon, such benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the
other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other
Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

            (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law,
each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such
notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to
set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and
any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time
held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application
made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision in any other Loan
Document, (i) if any Lender having a Tranche B Revolving Credit Loan receives
any Set-Off Benefit under any Loan Document, such Lender shall apply such
Set-Off Benefit to repay Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans and (ii) until all
Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans have been repaid in full and the Tranche B
Revolving Credit Commitments have terminated, no Lender shall exercise any right
of set-off or other rights to receive a Set-Off Benefit in respect of any Loan
(other than Tranche B Revolving Credit Loans) under any Loan Document without
the approval of the Required Tranche B Revolving Credit Lenders.

            13.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including
by facsimile transmission), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be
deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this
Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

            13.10 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

irrevocably and unconditionally:

            (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
      proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to
      which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
      respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts
      of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for
      the Southern District of New York and appellate courts from any thereof;

            (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in
      such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
      the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such
      action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not
      to plead or claim the same;

            (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding
      may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
      (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the
      Borrower at its address set forth in Section 13.2 or at such other address
      of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant
      thereto;

            (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
      service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the
      right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

            (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right
      it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred
      to in this Section 13.13 any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential
      damages.

            13.14 Acknowledgments. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:

            (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
      delivery of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents;

            (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any
      fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in
      connection with this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, and
      the relationship between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand,
      and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith
      is solely that of debtor and creditor; and


                                       83
<PAGE>

            (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Credit

      hereby among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.

            13.15 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT

            13.16 Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent and each Lender
shall hold all non-public information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower
in connection with such Lender's evaluation of whether to become a Lender
hereunder or obtained by such Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
requirements of this Agreement ("Confidential Information"), in accordance with
its customary procedure for handling confidential information of this nature and
(in the case of a Lender that is a bank) in accordance with safe and sound
banking practices and in any event may make disclosure as required or requested
by any governmental agency or representative thereof or pursuant to legal
process or to such Lender's or the Administrative Agent's attorneys,
professional advisors or independent auditors or Affiliates, provided that
unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender and
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any request by any
governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such request in
connection with an examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such
governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to
disclosure of such information, and provided further that in no event shall any
Lender or the Administrative Agent be obligated or required to return any
materials furnished by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower. Each
Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not provide to
prospective Transferees or to prospective direct or indirect contractual
counterparties in swap agreements to be entered into in connection with Loans
made hereunder any of the Confidential Information unless such Person shall have
previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement in the form of Exhibit K.

            13.17 Original Credit Agreement; Effectiveness of the Amendment and
Restatement. Until this Agreement becomes effective as provided in Section 6,
the Original Credit Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected hereby. After the Restatement Date, all obligations of the
Borrower under the Original Credit Agreement shall become obligations of the
Borrower hereunder, secured by the Collateral pledged under the Pledge
Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Mortgages, and the provisions of the
Original Credit Agreement shall be superseded by the provisions hereof.

            13.18 Waiver. Upon effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of
the Original Credit Agreement, the undersigned Lenders shall be deemed to have
waived compliance by the Borrower with Sections 10.10 and 10.11 of the Original
Credit Agreement in respect of the Test Periods ending December 31, 2000 and
March 31, 2001.
