Agencies to provide rating surveillance services on any certificates issued in a Securitization. In no event shall Borrower be required to pay any Servicer fees, Securitization trustee fees or other Securitization administrative expenses except as
may be expressly provided in this Agreement. Borrower shall, upon request from Lender, from time to time, cooperate, and Borrower shall, cause Carveout Guarantor and Borrower Representative to cooperate, in all reasonable respects in connection with
a Securitization. Such cooperation may, in Lender&#146;s discretion, include documentation changes, changes in organizational documents, changes in Accounts, Reserves, Payment Dates, interest accrual periods, insurance endorsement changes, tenant
payment direction changes, site inspections, updated appraisals, preparation and delivery of financial information or other diligence requested by Lender and/or any Rating Agency, execution of one or more promissory notes and the creation of Liens

otherwise dispose of all documents, schedules, invoices or other papers, delivered by Borrower to Lender unless Borrower requests, at the time of delivery, in writing that same be returned. Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor to
grant Lender any interest in the Mortgaged Property other than that of mortgagee, beneficiary or lender. No provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents and no course of dealing between the parties shall be deemed to create any
fiduciary duty by Lender to Borrower or any other Person. All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, and other professional Persons and consultants retained by Lender shall have the right to act exclusively in the interest of Lender and shall have no
duty of loyalty, duty of care or any other duty to Borrower or any of Borrower&#146;s partners, shareholders, members, managers, Affiliates or any other Person. By accepting or approving anything required to be observed, performed or fulfilled or to
be given to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents, Lender shall not be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality, effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or condition thereof, and such acceptance
or approval thereof shall not be or constitute any warranty or representation with respect hereto or thereto by Lender. Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any manner on any
statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender or their respective attorneys, advisors, accountants, officers, representatives, directors, employees, partners, shareholders, trustees,
members or managers. Lender shall not be subject to any limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the
ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take any action on the basis of the foregoing with
respect to Lender&#146;s exercise of any such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real estate financings and other real estate transactions and investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive
with the business of Borrower or its Affiliates. LENDER SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY HEREUNDER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES. In the case of any receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
composition or other proceedings affecting Borrower or Borrower Representative or Carveout Guarantor, or their respective creditors or property, Lender, to the extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Lender allowed in such proceedings for the entire secured Obligations at the date of the institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount which may become due and
payable by Borrower after such date. Lender shall have the right from time to time to designate, appoint and replace one or more servicers at Lender&#146;s sole cost and expense and to allow such servicers to exercise any and all rights of Lender
under the Loan Documents. All documents and other matters required by any of the provisions of this Agreement to be submitted or provided to Lender shall be in form and </FONT>

counsel reasonably acceptable to Lender; provided, however, Lender may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to participate in such defense, but such participation shall not be deemed to give Lender a right to control such defense, which
right Borrower expressly retains. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnitee shall, following notice to and consultation with Borrower, have the right to employ separate counsel at Borrower&#146;s expense if, in the reasonable opinion of legal
counsel, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnitee and Borrower that would make such separate representation advisable. Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify an Indemnitee for damage or loss resulting from such

respect to any amendment or modification, unless also signed by Borrower). Each amendment, modification, termination or waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or
demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle Borrower, or any other Person to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns,
waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of Borrower, Borrower&#146;s partners or members and others with interests in Borrower, and of the Mortgaged Property, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of all or
any of the Mortgage, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever
to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Mortgaged Property for the collection of the obligations without any prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the payment of the
obligations owing Lender on account of the Loan Documents out of the net proceeds of the Mortgaged Property in preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of
foreclosure of the Mortgage, any equitable right otherwise available to Borrower which would require the separate sale of any of any portion of the Mortgaged Property or require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any portion of the Mortgaged
Property or any combination of the Mortgaged Property before proceeding against any other portion; and further in the event of such foreclosure, Borrower expressly consents to and authorizes, at the option of Lender, the foreclosure and sale either
separately of all or any portion of the Mortgaged Property. Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by Lender or its agents. No failure or delay
on the part of Lender or any holder of any Note in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under the Note or any other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or
acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement, the
