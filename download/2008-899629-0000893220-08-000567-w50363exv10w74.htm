properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with any Uniform Commercial Code financing

this Agreement or any other Loan Documents with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any
creditor and (b)&nbsp;received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under such
Loan Documents. Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of Borrower&#146;s assets exceeds
and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed Borrower&#146;s total liabilities,
including, without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities.
The fair saleable value of Borrower&#146;s assets is and will, immediately following the making of the
Loan, be greater than Borrower&#146;s probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its
contingent liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Borrower&#146;s assets
do not and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small
capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not
intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur debt and liabilities (including contingent
liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debt and liabilities as they
mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the
amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower). No petition in bankruptcy has
been filed against Borrower or any Guarantor in the last seven (7)&nbsp;years, and neither Borrower nor
any Guarantor in the last seven (7)&nbsp;years has ever made an assignment for the benefit of creditors
or taken advantage of any insolvency act for the benefit of debtors. Neither Borrower nor any
Guarantor is contemplating either the filing of a petition by it under any state or federal
bankruptcy or insolvency laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower&#146;s assets or
property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing of any such petition
against it or such constituent Persons.

Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from
the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to
Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into
the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the
amount of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes, Other Charges
and Insurance Premiums pursuant to <U><B>Section&nbsp;5.1.2</B></U> hereof, Lender shall, in its sole
discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be made
to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund
after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. If at any time Lender
reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be sufficient to
pay Taxes, Other Charges and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a)&nbsp;and (b)&nbsp;above, Lender
shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payments (or,
if such determination is made during the Construction Term, Borrower shall deposit the full amount
of such deficiency within 5&nbsp;days of such notice) to Lender by the amount that Lender estimates is
sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the due date of the Taxes
and Other Charges and/or thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to expiration of the Policies, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower&#146;s obligation to make monthly deposits with Lender for
Insurance Premiums shall be suspended for so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and Borrower provides Lender with written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender
that all insurance coverages required to be maintained by Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement are being maintained in full force and effect through one or more blanket insurance
policies (provided that any such blanket insurance policies provide the same level of coverage
which would otherwise be provided by a stand-alone policy). Borrower shall provide evidence
reasonably acceptable to Lender on an annual basis thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the expiration of the
existing insurance that the insurance has been renewed and will provide notice of cancellation for
non-payment. In the event Borrower fails to provide such evidence or an Event of Default occurs,
however, Borrower will thereafter be required to make deposits with Lender for Insurance Premiums
as provided herein.

described in the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender.
Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled

effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue
thereof; provided, however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such power

exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy,
right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may
be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or
Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent
Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.
