computer systems to Donegal Mutual&#146;s computer systems. Upon completion of such transition, and
subject to the terms of the Technology License Agreement, Donegal Mutual will make its technology,
including its WritePro automated personal lines underwriting and policy issuance system, available

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;Sheboygan Falls shall reimburse Donegal Mutual for the direct costs, including salary and
benefits, of Donegal Mutual&#146;s employees performing systems analysis, programming and product
development services in the process of converting Sheboygan Falls&#146; information systems to Donegal
Mutual&#146;s information systems. Employees of Donegal Mutual performing such services will maintain a
record of time spent working on the system conversion project, and costs will be charged to
Sheboygan Falls on a monthly basis based upon the employees&#146; actual hourly rate and a factor
representing Donegal Mutual&#146;s average benefits cost as a percentage of salaries expense with no
additional overhead charge to Sheboygan Falls. Donegal Mutual agrees that the costs of its
services in assisting in the conversion of Sheboygan Falls&#146; information systems to Donegal Mutual&#146;s
information systems will not exceed $100,000. Such costs exclude any licensing fees or other
direct charges from third party vendors Donegal Mutual will be required to pay under license
agreements relating to Donegal Mutual&#146;s information systems in order to include Sheboygan Falls
under such license agreements and Sheboygan Falls shall reimburse Donegal Mutual for all such
license fees or other direct charges from third party vendors in addition to the costs of Donegal
Mutual&#146;s services as provided in the immediately preceding sentence.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;Upon the conversion of Sheboygan Falls&#146; information systems to Donegal Mutual&#146;s
information systems, calculation and settlement of allocations and reimbursements for information
services provided by Donegal Mutual on behalf of Sheboygan Falls shall be performed as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;Sheboygan Falls shall be included in the calculations currently performed to determine the
allocation of Donegal Mutual&#146;s information systems costs among the companies that currently receive
information services from Donegal Mutual. Donegal Mutual&#146;s estimated purchase price and
development costs of computer hardware and software systems required to provide such services are
divided by the number of years those systems are reasonably expected to serve the respective
information services requirements of Donegal Mutual and its affiliates. Such estimated annual cost
is then allocated to the respective companies based upon their proportionate net written premiums
in the year prior to the establishment of the allocation amounts. Donegal Mutual agrees that the
percentage allocation to Sheboygan Falls shall not exceed 1.0% of Sheboygan Falls&#146; net premiums
written for a period of two years following the first allocation billing.

Agreement under this Section&nbsp;7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the purchase and sale of the Note to have been consummated on or
