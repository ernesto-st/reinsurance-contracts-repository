by the Plan Administrator and the process by which a Participant may appeal the denial of a claim for Benefits are set forth in the SPD. As set forth in the SPD, insurance carriers (and other
entities) may serve as the claims fiduciary with regard to certain Benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
described in the SPD, if a Covered Person receives or becomes eligible to receive any dental, medical, vision and/or disability Benefit or other Benefit
("Reimbursable Benefit") arising from an accident, injury or illness for which the Covered Person has, may have, or has asserted any claim or rights to recovery against a third party or parties, then
any payments by this Plan with respect to such
Reimbursable Benefit shall be made on the condition that this Plan will be reimbursed by the Covered Person, to the extent of any amount or amounts received or receivable from or with respect to the
third party or parties, whether by way of suit, judgment, settlement, compromise or otherwise and without regard to how the amount received from the third party or parties is characterized. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

reimbursement and subrogation rights described herein regardless of whether the Covered Person's receipt of payment from other sources fully reimburses the Covered Person or whether the Covered Person
has been "made whole," (i.e., the Plan has the right of first reimbursement, even if the Covered Person is not fully compensated for his injury). The Plan's right of recovery applies to the full
amount the Covered Person receives (unreduced by attorneys' fees and other expenses). The Plan does not share the Covered Person's cost of recovery. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent set forth in the SPD, the Covered Person may be obligated to sign a reimbursement agreement, as prescribed by the Plan Administrator, before any
Reimbursable Benefits are paid from this Plan. If Reimbursable Benefits are to be paid with respect to a Covered Dependent who is a minor, the Plan Administrator may require the Participant to execute
a reimbursement agreement on the minor's behalf. All Covered Persons shall be obligated to cooperate with this Plan in its efforts to enforce its reimbursement rights and to refrain from any actions
that interfere with those rights. The Plan shall have the right to take all appropriate actions necessary to enforce its reimbursement rights in the event that a </FONT></P>
