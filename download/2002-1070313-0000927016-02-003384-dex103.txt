     Revolving Loan deemed to be made by Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient
     to repay in full the Refunded Swing Line Loans. If any portion of any such
     amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to Swing Line Lender should be recovered
     by or on behalf of Company from Swing Line Lender in bankruptcy, by
     assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the
     amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Lenders in the manner
     contemplated by subsection 10.5.

          If for any reason (a) Revolving Loans are not made upon the request of
     Swing Line Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph in an
     amount sufficient to repay any amounts owed to Swing Line Lender in respect
     of any outstanding Swing Line Loans or (b) the Revolving Loan Commitments
     are terminated at a time when any

                                       47
<PAGE>

     Swing Line Loans are outstanding, each Lender shall be deemed to, and
     hereby agrees to, have purchased a participation in such outstanding Swing
     Line Loans in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (calculated, in the
     case of the foregoing clause (b), immediately prior to such termination of
     the Revolving Loan Commitments) of the unpaid amount of such Swing Line
     Loans together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one Business Day's
     notice from Swing Line Lender, each Lender shall deliver to Swing Line
     Lender an amount equal to its respective participation in same day funds at
     the Funding and Payment Office. In the event any Lender fails to make
     available to Swing Line Lender the amount of such Lender's participation as
     provided in this paragraph, Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover
     such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at
     the rate customarily used by Swing Line Lender for the correction of errors
     among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. In the
     event Swing Line Lender receives a payment of any amount in which other
     Lenders have purchased participations as provided in this paragraph, Swing
     Line Lender shall promptly distribute to each such other Lender its Pro
     Rata Share of such payment.

          Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each
     Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans for the purpose of repaying any
     Refunded Swing Line Loans pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and
     each Lender's obligation to purchase a participation in any unpaid Swing
     Line Loans pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall be
     absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
     including (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
     which such Lender may have against Swing Line Lender, Company or any other
     Person for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or continuation of an
     Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default; (c) any adverse change in
     the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or
     otherwise) or prospects of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) any
     breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any party thereto;
     or (e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or
     not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that such obligations of each
     Lender are subject to the condition that (X) Swing Line Lender believed in
     good faith that all conditions under subsection 4.2 (in the case of Loans
     made on the Effective Date) and 4.3 (in the case of all Loans) to the
     making of the applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing
     Line Loans, as the case may be, were satisfied at the time such Refunded
     Swing Line Loans or unpaid Swing Line Loans were made or (Y) the
     satisfaction of any such condition not satisfied had been waived in
     accordance with subsection 10.6 prior to or at the time such Refunded Swing
     Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans were made.

          (v)  [Intentionally left blank]

     B.   Borrowing Mechanics. Revolving Loans made on any Funding Date (other
than Revolving Loans made pursuant to a request by Swing Line Lender pursuant to
subsection 2.1A(iv) for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans or
Revolving Loans made pursuant to subsection 3.3B for the purpose of reimbursing
any Issuing Lender for the amount of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued
by it) shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount; provided that Revolving Loans
made on any Funding Date as Eurodollar Rate Loans with a particular Interest
Period shall

                                       48
<PAGE>

be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of
$50,000 in excess of that amount. Swing Line Loans made on any Funding Date
shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of
$100,000 in excess of that amount. Whenever Company desires that Lenders make
Revolving Loans it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing
no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least three Business Days in
advance of the proposed Funding Date (in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan) or
at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in the case
of a Base Rate Loan). Whenever Company desires that Swing Line Lender make a
Swing Line Loan, it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing
no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the proposed Funding Date. The
Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the proposed Funding Date (which shall be
a Business Day), (ii) the amount and type of Loans requested, (iii) in the case
of Swing Line Loans, that such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans, (iv) in the case
of any Revolving Loans, whether such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans or
Eurodollar Rate Loans, (v) in the case of any Loans requested to be made as
Eurodollar Rate Loans, the initial Interest Period requested therefor and, (vi)
that, after giving effect to the Loans requested thereby, the Total Utilization
of Commitments will not exceed the Adjusted Borrowing Base Amount then in effect
and, in the case of Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans, the Total Utilization
of Revolving Loan Commitments shall not exceed the aggregate amount of all
Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect. Revolving Loans may be continued as
or converted into Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans in the manner
provided in subsection 2.2D. In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of
Borrowing, Company may give Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the
required time of any proposed borrowing under this subsection 2.1B; provided
that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a Notice
of Borrowing to Administrative Agent on or before the applicable Funding Date.

     Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to
Company in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that
Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly
authorized officer or other person authorized to borrow on behalf of Company or
for otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.1B, and upon funding
of Loans by Lenders in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such
telephonic notice Company shall have effected Loans hereunder.

     Company shall notify Administrative Agent prior to the funding of any Loans
in the event that any of the matters to which Company is required to certify in
the applicable Notice of Borrowing is no longer true and correct as of the
applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by Company of the proceeds of any
Loans shall constitute a re-certification by Company, as of the applicable
Funding Date, as to the matters to which Company is required to certify in the
applicable Notice of Borrowing.

     Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6G, a Notice
of Borrowing for a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof)
shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date,
and Company shall be bound to make a borrowing in accordance therewith.

     C.   Disbursement of Funds. All Revolving Loans under this Agreement shall
be made by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their respective Pro
Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any
default by any other Lender in that other

                                       49
<PAGE>

Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder nor shall the Commitment
of any Lender to make the particular type of Loan requested be increased or
decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that other Lender's
obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder. Promptly after receipt by
Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to subsection 2.1B (or
telephonic notice in lieu thereof), Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, of the proposed borrowing. Each
Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to Administrative Agent not
later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the applicable Funding Date, and
Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to
Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the
applicable Funding Date, in each case in same day funds in Dollars, at the
Funding and Payment Office. Except as provided in subsection 2.1A(iv) or
subsection 3.3B with respect to Revolving Loans used to repay Refunded Swing
Line Loans or to reimburse any Issuing Lender for the amount of a drawing under
a Letter of Credit issued by it, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
precedent specified in subsections 4.2 (in the case of Loans made on the
Effective Date) and 4.3 (in the case of all Loans), Administrative Agent shall
make the proceeds of such Loans available to Company on the applicable Funding
Date by causing an amount of same day funds in Dollars equal to the proceeds of
all such Loans received by Administrative Agent from Lenders or Swing Line
Lender, as the case may be, to be credited to the account of Company at the
Funding and Payment Office.

     Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to
the Funding Date for any Loans that such Lender does not intend to make
available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Loan requested on
such Funding Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such amount available to Administrative Agent on such Funding Date and
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Company a corresponding amount on such Funding Date. If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by
such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to
Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the
correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the
Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify Company and Company shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to
Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from such
Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the
rate payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Nothing in this
subsection 2.1C shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
fulfill its Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Company may
have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

     D.   The Register.

          (i)  Administrative Agent shall maintain, at its address referred to
     in subsection 10.8, a register for the recordation of the names and
     addresses of Lenders and the Commitments and Loans of each Lender from time
     to time (the "Register"). The Register shall be available for inspection by
     Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
     reasonable prior notice.

                                       50
<PAGE>

          (ii)  Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the Term Loan
     Commitment, the Term Loans, the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Revolving
     Loans from time to time of each Lender, the Swing Line Loan Commitment and
     the Swing Line Loans from time to time of Swing Line Lender, and each
     repayment or prepayment in respect of the principal amount of the Term
     Loans and the Revolving Loans of each Lender or the Swing Line Loans of
     Swing Line Lender. Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on
     Company and each Lender, absent manifest error; provided that failure to
     make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not
     affect any Lender's Commitments or Company's Obligations in respect of any
     applicable Loans.

          (iii) Each Lender shall record on its internal records (including the
     Notes held by such Lender) the amount of the Term Loan and each Revolving
     Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof. Any such recordation
     shall be conclusive and binding on Company, absent manifest error; provided
     that, failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such
     recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Company's
     Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans; and provided, further that,
     in the event of any inconsistency between the Register and any Lender's
     records, the recordations in the Register shall govern and be conclusive
     and binding on such Lender, absent manifest error.

          (iv)  Company, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall deem and treat
     the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders and owners of
     the corresponding Commitments and Loans listed therein for all purposes
     hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Commitment or Loan shall
     be effective, in each case unless and until an Assignment Agreement
     effecting the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by
     Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register as provided in subsection
     10.1B(ii). Prior to such recordation, all amounts owed with respect to the
     applicable Commitment or Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed in the
     Register as the owner thereof, and any request, authority or consent of any
     Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
     consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and
     binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the
     corresponding Commitments or Loans.

          (v)   Company hereby designates Fleet (or such Person who may serve as
     Successor Administrative Agent) to serve as Company's agent solely for
     purposes of maintaining the Register as provided in this subsection 2.1D,
     and Company hereby agrees that, to the extent Fleet (or such Person who may
     serve as Successor Administrative Agent) serves in such capacity, Fleet and
     its officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates shall constitute
     Indemnitees for all purposes under subsection 10.3.

     E.   Optional Notes. If so requested by any Lender by written notice to
Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) at least two Business Days prior
to the Effective Date or at any time thereafter, Company shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable and if so specified in such
notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender pursuant to subsection
10.1) on the Effective Date (or, if such notice is delivered after the Effective
Date, promptly after Company's receipt of such notice) a promissory note or
promissory notes to

                                       51
<PAGE>

evidence such Lender's Revolving Loans, Term Loans or Swing Line Loans,
substantially in the form of Exhibit IV, IV-A or Exhibit V annexed hereto,
respectively, with appropriate insertions.

2.2  Interest on the Loans.
     ---------------------

     A.   Rate of Interest. Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.6 and
2.7, each Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal amount thereof from the date made through but excluding the date of
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined by
reference to the Base Rate or the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate. Subject to the
provisions of subsection 2.7, each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate.
The applicable basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any
Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) shall be selected by Company initially at the
time a Notice of Borrowing is given with respect to such Loan pursuant to
subsection 2.1B. The basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any
Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) may be changed from time to time pursuant to
subsection 2.2D. If on any day a Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) is
outstanding with respect to which notice has not been delivered to
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement specifying
the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day
that Loan shall bear interest determined by reference to the Base Rate.

          (i)  Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E and 2.7, each Loan
     (other than Swing Line Loans) shall bear interest through maturity as
     follows:

               (a)  if a Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Base Rate plus
          the Applicable Base Rate Margin; or

               (b)  if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Adjusted
          Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin.

          (ii) Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E and 2.7, the Swing
     Line Loans shall bear interest through maturity at the sum of the Base Rate
     plus the Applicable Base Rate Margin.

     B.   Interest Periods. In connection with each Eurodollar Rate Loan,
Company may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an interest period (each an
"Interest Period") to be applicable to such Loan, which Interest Period shall
be, at Company's option, a one-, two-, three- or six-month period; provided
that:

          (i)  the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan shall
     commence on the Funding Date in respect of such Loan, in the case of a Loan
     initially made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on the date specified in the
     applicable Notice of Conversion/Continuation, in the case of a Loan
     converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan;

          (ii) in the case of immediately successive Interest Periods applicable
     to a Eurodollar Rate Loan continued as such pursuant to a Notice of

                                       52
<PAGE>

     Conversion/Continuation, each successive Interest Period shall commence on
     the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;

          (iii)  if an Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is
     not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
     succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any Interest Period would
     otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of the
     month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
     Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

          (iv)   any Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of a
     calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding
     day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period) shall,
     subject to clause (v) of this subsection 2.2B, end on the last Business Day
     of a calendar month;

          (v)    no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the Term
     Loans shall extend beyond July 20, 2006, and no Interest Period with
     respect to any portion of the Revolving Loans shall extend beyond the
     Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date;

          (vi)   there shall be no more than fifteen (15) Interest Periods
     outstanding at any time; and

          (vii)  in the event Company fails to specify an Interest Period for
     any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
     Conversion/Continuation, Company shall be deemed to have selected an
     Interest Period of one month.

     C.   Interest Payments. Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.2E,
interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to but excluding each
Interest Payment Date applicable to that Loan, upon any prepayment of that Loan
(to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) and at maturity (including
final maturity); provided that in the event any Swing Line Loans or any
Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans are prepaid pursuant to subsection
2.4B, interest accrued on such Swing Line Loans or Revolving Loans through the
date of such prepayment shall be payable on the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date applicable to Base Rate Loans (or, if earlier, at final maturity).

     D.   Conversion or Continuation. Subject to the provisions of subsection
2.6, Company shall have the option (i) to convert at any time all or any part of
its outstanding Term Loans or Revolving Loans equal to $500,000 and integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount from Loans bearing interest at a
rate determined by reference to one basis to Loans bearing interest at a rate
determined by reference to an alternative basis or (ii) upon the expiration of
any Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any
portion of such Loan equal to $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in
excess of that amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan;

     Company shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation at any time after
the Effective Date to Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date
(in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business
Days in advance of the proposed

                                       53
<PAGE>

conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation
of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). A Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall specify
(i) the proposed conversion/continuation date (which shall be a Business Day),
(ii) the amount and type of the Loan to be converted/continued, (iii) the nature
of the proposed conversion/continuation, (iv) in the case of a conversion to, or
a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the requested Interest Period, and
(v) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate
Loan, that no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, Company may give Administrative Agent telephonic notice
by the required time of any proposed conversion/continuation under this
subsection 2.2D; provided that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in
writing by delivery of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Administrative
Agent on or before the proposed conversion/continuation date. Upon receipt of
written or telephonic notice of any proposed conversion/continuation under this
subsection 2.2D, Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit such notice by
telefacsimile or telephone to each Lender.

     Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to
Company in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that
Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly
authorized officer or other person authorized to act on behalf of Company or for
otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.2D, and upon conversion
or continuation of the applicable basis for determining the interest rate with
respect to any Loans in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such
telephonic notice Company shall have effected a conversion or continuation, as
the case may be, hereunder.

     Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6G, a Notice
of Conversion/Continuation for conversion to, or continuation of, a Eurodollar
Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and
after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and Company shall be bound
to effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Eurodollar Rate Loans may be converted to
Base Rate Loans prior to the expiration of the applicable Interest Periods so
long as such conversion occurs on the Effective Date; provided that accrued
interest through the Effective Date on the Loans so converted shall be paid
within five Business Days following the Effective Date.

     E.   Default Interest. Notwithstanding the rates of interest specified in
Section 2.2 or elsewhere herein, effective immediately upon either (i) the
occurrence of any Event of Default referred to in Section 8.1, 8.6 or 8.7 or
(ii) receipt by Company of written notice from the Administrative Agent (at the
direction of the Requisite Lenders) with respect to any Event of Default (other
than the Event of Defaults referred to in clause (i)), and for as long
thereafter as such Event of Default shall be continuing, the principal balance
of all Loans and all other Obligations shall bear interest at a rate which is
two percent (2.0%) per annum (the "Default Rate") in excess of the rate of
interest applicable to such Loans and Obligations from time to time, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, and shall be payable upon demand; provided
that, in the case of overdue Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the expiration of the
Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in interest rate is
effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon become Base Rate Loans and
shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a

                                       54
<PAGE>

rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable
under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased
rates of interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a permitted
alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of
Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative
Agent or any Lender.

     F.   Computation of Interest. Interest on the Loans shall be computed (i)
in the case of Base Rate Loans, on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as
the case may be, and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the basis of
a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period
during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the
making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such
Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a Eurodollar Rate
Loan, the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Base Rate
Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such
Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or,
with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the
case may be, shall be excluded; provided that if a Loan is repaid on the same
day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.

2.3  Fees.
     ----

     A.   Commitment Fees. Company agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, for
distribution to each Lender in proportion to that Lender's Pro Rata Share,
commitment fees for the period from and including the Closing Date to and
excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date equal to the average of
the daily excess of the Revolving Loan Commitments over the Total Utilization of
Revolving Loan Commitments less outstanding Swingline Loans (other than, with
respect to Swingline Lender, the Swingline Lenders Pro Rata Share of the
Swingline Loans) multiplied by the Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage, such
commitment fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual
number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June
15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on the first such date
to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Revolving Loan Commitment
Termination Date. Any such calculation or distribution of fees pursuant to this
subsection 2.3A shall take into account the increase in Revolving Loan
Commitments and adjustments to Pro Rata Shares with respect thereto as of the
Effective Date.

     B.   Restructuring Fee. Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the ratable benefit of those Lenders signatory to this Agreement (based upon
such Existing Lenders' Pro Rata Shares under the terms of the Existing Credit
Agreement immediately prior to the occurrence of the Effective Date), a
restructuring fee (the "Restructuring Fee"), fully earned and payable in cash on
the Effective Date, in an amount equal to (a) $675,000,000 times (b) 0.50%.

     C.   Success Fee; PIK Interest. The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders (based upon the
Lenders' Pro Rata Shares after the Effective Date), a fee in the amount of
$5,000,000, as such amount may be increased from time to time as set forth below
(the "Success Fee"). The Success Fee shall be fully earned on the Effective Date
and shall be non-refundable. The Success Fee shall be paid in full in cash on
the earliest to occur of (i) July 20, 2006, (ii) the date on which the Loans and
all Obligations (other

                                       55
<PAGE>

than the Success Fee) shall have been repaid in full, and (iii) the occurrence
of a Material Liquidation Event (such earliest date, the "Success Fee
Termination Date"). The Success Fee shall constitute an Obligation and shall be

; provided that the scheduled installments of principal of the Term Loans set
forth above shall be reduced in connection with any voluntary or mandatory
prepayments of the Term Loans in accordance with subsection 2.4B(iv); and
provided, further that the Term Loans and all other amounts owed hereunder with
respect to the Term Loans shall be paid in full no later than July 20, 2006, and
the final installment payable by Company in respect of the Term Loans on such
date shall be in an amount, if such amount is different from that specified

with respect to the Term Loans.

     B.   Prepayments and Reductions in Revolving Loan Commitments.

          (i)  Voluntary Prepayments. Company may, upon written or telephonic
     notice to Administrative Agent on or prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City
     time) on the date of prepayment, which notice, if telephonic, shall be
     promptly confirmed in writing, at any time and from time to time prepay any
     Swing Line Loan on any Business Day in whole or in part in an aggregate
     minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of
     that amount. Company may, upon written or telephonic notice on the date of
     prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and three Business Days' prior
     written or telephonic notice, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each
     case given to Administrative Agent by 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on
     the date required and, if given by telephone, promptly confirmed in writing
     to Administrative Agent (which original written or telephonic notice
     Administrative Agent will promptly transmit by telefacsimile or telephone
     to each Lender), at any time and from time to time prepay any Term Loans or
     Revolving Loans on any Business Day in whole or in part in an aggregate
     minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of
     that amount. Notice of prepayment having been given as aforesaid, the
     principal amount of the Loans specified in such notice shall become due and
     payable on the prepayment date specified therein. Any such voluntary
     prepayment shall be applied as specified in subsection 2.4B(iv).

          (ii) Voluntary Reductions of Revolving Loan Commitments. Company may,
     upon not less than three Business Days' prior written or telephonic notice
     confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent (which original written or
     telephonic notice Administrative Agent will promptly transmit by
     telefacsimile or telephone to each Lender), at any time and from time to
     time terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part, without premium or
     penalty, the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount up to the amount by
     which the Revolving Loan Commitments exceed the Total Utilization of
     Revolving Loan Commitments at the time of such proposed termination or
     reduction after giving effect to any concurrent repayment of Revolving
     Loans and Letter of Credit; provided that any such partial reduction of the
     Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of
     $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount.
     Company's notice to Administrative Agent shall designate the

                                       57
<PAGE>

     date (which shall be a Business Day) of such termination or reduction and
     the amount of any partial reduction, and such termination or reduction of
     the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be effective on the date specified in
     Company's notice and shall reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment of each
     Lender proportionately to its Pro Rata Share.

          (iii) Mandatory Prepayments. The Loans shall be prepaid in the amounts
     and under the circumstances set forth below, all such prepayments to be
     applied as set forth below or as more specifically provided in subsection
     2.4B(iv).

                (a)  Prepayments From Net Asset Sale Proceeds. No later than the
          fifth Business Day following the date of receipt by Company or any of
          its Subsidiaries of any Net Asset Sale Proceeds in respect of any
          Asset Sale, Company shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount
          equal to such Net Asset Sale Proceeds. If Company is otherwise
          required to apply any portion of Net Asset Sale Proceeds to prepay
          Indebtedness evidenced by the Second Priority Term Loans or the Senior
          Notes then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
          the contrary, Company shall apply such Net Asset Sale Proceeds to the
          prepayment of the Loans so as to eliminate or minimize any obligation
          to prepay the Second Priority Term Loans or the Senior Notes.

               (b)   Prepayments from Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds. No
          later than the tenth Business Day following the date of receipt by
          Administrative Agent or by Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
          Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds that are required to be applied to
          prepay the Loans pursuant to the provisions of subsection 6.4C,
          Company shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the
          amount of such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds minus (if (1) no
          Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (2) Company
          shall have delivered to Administrative Agent, on or before such tenth
          Business Day, the Officers' Certificate described in subsection 6.4C),
          any Proposed Insurance Reinvestment Proceeds; provided, that at
          Company's option, such Proposed Insurance Reinvestment Proceeds may be
          applied to prepay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full extent
          thereof. In addition, no later than 180 days after receipt of any
          Proposed Insurance Reinvestment Proceeds, Company shall prepay the
          Loans in an amount equal to the amount of any such Proposed Insurance
          Reinvestment Proceeds that have not theretofore been applied to (or
          contractually committed to be applied to) the costs of repairing,
          restoring or replacing the applicable assets of Company or its
          Subsidiaries or reinvested in assets used in the ordinary course of
          business; provided further that, Company shall not be required to make
          any prepayment of the Loans to the extent that Net
          Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are less than (i) $1,000,000 with
          respect to any individual insurance claim and (ii) $5,000,000 for all
          insurance claims in any Fiscal Year.

               (c)   Prepayments Due to Issuance of Debt. On the date of receipt
          by Holdings, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of the
          Cash proceeds of any Indebtedness, including debt Securities of
          Holdings, Company or any of

                                       58
<PAGE>

          their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Loans and any other
          Indebtedness permitted under subsections 7.1 (such proceeds, net of
          underwriting discounts and commissions and other reasonable costs and
          expenses associated therewith, including reasonable legal fees and
          expenses, being the "Net Indebtedness Proceeds")), Company shall
          prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Indebtedness
          Proceeds; provided, however, that payment or acceptance of the amounts
          provided for in this subsection 2.4B(iii)(c) shall not constitute a
          waiver of any Event of Default resulting from the incurrence of such
          Indebtedness or otherwise prejudice any rights or remedies of Agents
          or Lenders. If Company is otherwise required to apply any portion of
          Net Indebtedness Proceeds to prepay Indebtedness evidenced by the
          Second Priority Term Loans or the Senior Notes then, notwithstanding
          anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Company shall
          apply such Net Indebtedness Proceeds to the prepayment of the Loans so
          as to eliminate or minimize any obligation to prepay the Second
          Priority Term Loans or the Senior Notes.

               (d)  Prepayments Due to Issuance of Equity Securities. On the
          date of receipt by Holdings or Company of Cash proceeds (any such
          proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other
          reasonable costs and expenses associated therewith, including
          reasonable legal fees and expenses, being "Net Equity Proceeds") from
          the issuance of any equity Securities of Holdings or Company after the
          Effective Date (other than (1) capital contributions by Holdings to
          Company or any other Subsidiary, (2) issuances of Securities to the
          General Partner or Holdings by Company or (3) issuances of Holdings
          Common Units, Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units or Qualified
          Preferred Units (x) to employees, officers, directors and consultants
          of Holdings and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business in
          connection with their employment by Holdings, Company or its
          Subsidiaries and (y) to Bain Investors, the Other Investors, the
          Existing Investors, and their Related Parties to the extent the Cash
          proceeds thereof are not in excess of $10,000,000 and (z) in
          connection with payment of all or any portion of the purchase price of
          a business or assets in a Permitted Acquisition), Company shall prepay
          the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Equity Proceeds. If
          Company is otherwise required to apply any portion of Net Equity
          Proceeds to prepay Indebtedness evidenced by the Second Priority Term
          Loans or the Senior Notes then, notwithstanding anything contained in
          this Agreement to the contrary, Company shall apply such Net Equity
          Proceeds to the prepayment of the Loans so as to eliminate or minimize
          any obligation to prepay the Second Priority Term Loans or the Senior
          Notes.

               (e)  Prepayments Due to Excess. If on the last Business Day of
          each calendar week the Book Cash is greater than $10,000,000, Company
          shall prepay the Loans on the second Business Day of the following
          calendar week in an amount equal to the excess of such aggregate
          amount over $10,000,000 (the "Excess Cash Prepayment Amount");
          provided, however, to the extent that such last Business Day is also
          the last day of any month, fiscal quarter or Fiscal Year of Company,
          Company may make adjustments for any overage or shortage

                                       59
<PAGE>

          relating to the payment made on such second Business Day on or before
          the fifth Business Day following the date such payment is made.

               (f)  Calculations of Net Proceeds Amounts; Additional Prepayments
          and Reductions Based on Subsequent Calculations. Concurrently with any
          prepayment of the Loans pursuant to subsections 2.4B(iii)(a)-(e),
          Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Officers' Certificate
          demonstrating the calculation of the amount (the "Net Proceeds
          Amount") of the applicable Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Net
          Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Net Indebtedness Proceeds, Net Equity
          Proceeds or Excess Cash Prepayment Amount (as such terms are defined
          in subsections 2.4B(iii)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), respectively), as
          the case may be, that gave rise to such prepayment. In the event that
          Company shall subsequently determine that the actual Net Proceeds
          Amount was greater than the amount set forth in such Officers'
          Certificate, Company shall promptly make an additional prepayment of
          the Loans in an amount equal to the amount of such excess, and Company
          shall concurrently therewith deliver to Administrative Agent an
          Officers' Certificate demonstrating the derivation of the additional
          Net Proceeds Amount resulting in such excess.

               (g)  Prepayments Relating to the Borrowing Base. (I) Company
          shall from time to time prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment
          Termination Date, prepay Loans (and after all Loans have been repaid,
          deposit in a collateral account same day funds in an amount equal to
          the Letter of Credit Usage until such time as the Letters of Credit
          shall have been terminated and the Letter of Credit Usage has been
          reduced to zero or until no payment is otherwise required under this
          clause (g)) in such amounts as shall be necessary so that at all times
          the Total Utilization of Commitments shall not exceed the Adjusted
          Borrowing Base Amount then in effect.

               (II) Company shall from time to time prior to the Revolving Loan
          Commitment Termination Date, prepay Loans (and after all Loans have
          been repaid, deposit in a collateral account same day funds in an
          amount equal to the Letter of Credit Usage until such time as the
          Letters of Credit shall have been terminated and the Letter of Credit
          Usage has been reduced to zero or until no payment is otherwise
          required under this clause (g)) in such amounts as shall be necessary
          so that at all times the Total Utilization of Commitments shall not
          exceed the amount of the Adjusted Borrowing Base Amount then in effect
          minus the Minimum Revolver Availability Amount then in effect.

               (h)  Prepayments Due to Restrictions of Revolving Loan
          Commitments. Company shall from time to time prepay first the Swing
          Line Loans and second the Revolving Loans to the extent necessary so
          that the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments shall not at
          any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect.

          (iv) Application of Prepayments.

                                       60
<PAGE>

          (a)  Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type of Loans and Order
     of Maturity. Any voluntary prepayments pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall
     be applied automatically, without any discretion from the Company, first to
     repay outstanding Swing Line Loans to the full extent thereof, and second
     to repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof, and third
     to repay outstanding Term Loans to the full extent thereof.

          (b)  Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type of Loans. Any amount
     (the "Applied Amount") required to be applied as a mandatory prepayment of
     the Loans pursuant to subsections 2.4B(iii)(a)-(g) shall be applied first
     to prepay the Swing Line Loans to the full extent thereof, second to prepay
     the Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof but without any
     corresponding Commitments reduction and third to the extent of any
     remaining portion of the Applied Amount, to prepay the Term Loans to the
     full extent thereof.

          (c)  Application of Prepayments to Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate
     Loans. Any prepayment shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full
     extent thereof before application to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case in
     a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by
     Company pursuant to subsection 2.6D.

          (d)  Application of Mandatory Prepayments of Term Loans to the
     Scheduled Installments of Principal Thereof. Any mandatory prepayments of
     the Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii) shall be applied to reduce
     the scheduled installments of principal of the Term Loans set forth in
     subsection 2.4A(i) on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the respective
     outstanding principal amounts thereof) to each scheduled installment of
     principal of the Term Loans set forth in subsection 2.4A(i) that is unpaid
     at the time of such prepayment.

C.   General Provisions Regarding Payments.

     (i)  Manner and Time of Payment. All payments by Company of principal,
interest, fees and other Obligations hereunder and under the Notes shall be made
in Dollars in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of
any restriction or condition, and delivered to Administrative Agent not later
than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date due at the Funding and Payment
Office for the account of Lenders; funds received by Administrative Agent after
that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by Company on the
next succeeding Business Day. Company hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to
charge its accounts with Administrative Agent in order to cause timely payment
to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal, interest, fees and expenses
due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being available in its accounts for
that purpose).

     (ii) Application of Payments to Principal and Interest. Except as provided
in subsection 2.2C, all payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan
shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid
or prepaid, and

                                       61
<PAGE>

     all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan
     on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall
     be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal.

          (iii)  Apportionment of Payments. Aggregate principal and interest
     payments in respect of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be apportioned
     among all outstanding Loans to which such payments relate, in each case
     proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares giving effect to any
     adjustments in Pro Rata Shares on and after the Effective Date.
     Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, at its
     primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page
     hereof or at such other address as such Lender may request, its Pro Rata
     Share of all such payments received by Administrative Agent and the
     commitment fees of such Lender when received by Administrative Agent
     pursuant to subsection 2.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
     this subsection 2.4C(iii), if, pursuant to the provisions of subsection
     2.6C, any Notice of Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to any Affected
     Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro
     Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, Administrative Agent shall give
     effect thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter.

          (iv)   Payments on Business Days. Subject to the provisions of
     subsection 2.2B, whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated
     to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made
     on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
     included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the
     commitment fees hereunder, as the case may be.

          (v)    Notation of Payment. Each Lender agrees that before disposing
     of any Note held by it, or any part thereof (other than by granting
     participations therein), that Lender will make a notation thereon of all
     Loans evidenced by that Note and all principal payments previously made
     thereon and of the date to which interest thereon has been paid; provided
     that the failure to make (or any error in the making of) a notation of any
     Loan made under such Note shall not limit or otherwise affect the
     obligations of Company hereunder or under such Note with respect to any
     Loan or any payments of principal or interest on such Note.

2.6  Special Provisions Governing Eurodollar Rate Loans.
     --------------------------------------------------

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans as to
the matters covered:

     A.   Determination of Applicable Interest Rate. As soon as practicable
after 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date,
Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest
error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that
shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then
being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give
notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and
each Lender.

     B.   Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. In the event that
Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be final
and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate
Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, that by reason of
circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar market adequate and fair means
do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the
basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, Administrative
Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed
in writing) to Company and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no
Loans may be made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as
Administrative Agent notifies Company and Lenders that the circumstances giving
rise to such notice no longer exist and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice
of Conversion/Continuation given by Company with respect to the Loans in respect
of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by Company.

     C.   Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar Rate Loans. In the event
that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but shall be made only
after consultation with Company and Administrative Agent) that the making,
maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become unlawful
as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty,
governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any
such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the
force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful)
or (ii) has become impracticable, or would cause such Lender material hardship,
as a result of contingencies occurring after the date of this Agreement which
materially and adversely affect the interbank Eurodollar market or the position

                                       64
<PAGE>

of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be
an "Affected Lender" and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or
by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such
determination (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each
other Lender). Thereafter (a) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make
Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until
such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such
determination by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then
being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert
such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's
obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the "Affected
Loans") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the
Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when
required by law, and (d) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into
Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates
to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice
of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Company shall have the
option, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, to rescind such Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation as to all Lenders by giving
notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Administrative
Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice
of its determination as described above (which notice of rescission
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection 2.6C
shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make
or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     D.   Compensation For Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest Periods.
Company shall compensate each Lender, promptly upon written request by that
Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts),
for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid
by that Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its
Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by that
Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds) which
that Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by that
Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date
specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a telephonic request for
borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does
not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation or
a telephonic request for conversion or continuation, (ii) if any prepayment
(including any prepayment pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i)) or other principal
payment or any conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a date
prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan, (iii) if
any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any date
specified in a notice of prepayment given by Company, or (iv) as a consequence
of any other default by Company in the repayment of its Eurodollar Rate Loans
when required by the terms of this Agreement.

     E.   Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Subject to its obligations under
subsection 2.8, any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at,
to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an
Affiliate of that Lender.

                                       65
<PAGE>

     F.   Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Calculation
of all amounts payable to a Lender under this subsection 2.6 and under
subsection 2.7A shall be made as though that Lender had actually funded each of
its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit
bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition
of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar
Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and
through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that
Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United States of America;
provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Rate Loans
in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only
for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this subsection 2.6 and
under subsection 2.7A.

     G.   Eurodollar Rate Loans After Default. After the occurrence of and
during the continuation of an Event of Default, (i) Company may not elect to
have a Loan be made or maintained as, or converted to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan
after the expiration of any Interest Period then in effect for that Loan and
(ii) subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, any Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Company with respect to a requested
borrowing or conversion/continuation of, or into, Eurodollar Rate Loans that has
not yet occurred shall be deemed to be rescinded by Company.

2.7  Increased Costs; Taxes; Capital Adequacy.
     ----------------------------------------

     A.   Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes. Subject to the provisions
of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters
covered thereby), in the event that any Lender shall determine (which
determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding
upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation
or order, or any change therein or in the interpretation, administration or
application thereof (including the introduction of any new law, treaty or
governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of a court or
governmental authority, in each case that becomes effective after the date
hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any guideline, request or directive
issued or made after the date hereof by any central bank or other governmental
or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law):

          (i)  subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office) to any
     additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such
     Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder
     or any payments to such Lender (or its applicable lending office) of
     principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder;

          (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any
     marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special
     deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement against
     assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
     or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
     acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any such
     reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that
     are reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or

                                       66
<PAGE>

          (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax
     matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or
     its obligations hereunder or the interbank Eurodollar market;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make, making or maintaining Loans hereunder or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending office) with
respect thereto; then, in any such case, Company shall promptly pay to such
Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such
additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its
sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender
for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable
hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative
Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender under this subsection
2.7A, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
absent manifest error.

     B.   Withholding of Taxes.

          (i)  Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by Company under
     this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall (except to the extent
     required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or
     withholding on account of, any Tax (other than a Tax on the overall net
     income of any Lender) imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by
     or within the United States of America or any political subdivision in or
     of the United States of America or any other jurisdiction from or to which
     a payment is made by or on behalf of Company or by any federation or
     organization of which the United States of America or any such jurisdiction
     is a member at the time of payment.

          (ii) Grossing-up of Payments. If Company or any other Person is
     required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any such
     Tax from any sum paid or payable by Company to Administrative Agent or any
     Lender under any of the Loan Documents:

               (a)  Company shall notify Administrative Agent of any such
          requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as Company
          becomes aware of it;

               (b)  Company shall pay any such Tax before the date on which
          penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the liability to
          pay is imposed on Company) for its own account or (if that liability
          is imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be)
          on behalf of and in the name of Administrative Agent or such Lender;

               (c)  the sum payable by Company in respect of which the relevant
          deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to
          the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that
          deduction, withholding or payment, Administrative Agent or such
          Lender, as the case may be, receives on

                                       67
<PAGE>

          the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no
          such deduction, withholding or payment been required or made; and

                (d)  within 30 days after paying any sum from which it is
          required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within 30
          days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required by
          clause (b) above to pay, Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent
          evidence satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction,
          withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant
          taxing or other authority;

provided that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid to any
Lender under clause (c) above except to the extent that any change after the
Closing Date (in the case of each Existing Lender), after the Effective Date (in
the case of each New Lender) or after the date of the Assignment Agreement
pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender)
in any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment as is mentioned
therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such deduction, withholding
or payment from that in effect at the date of this Agreement or at the date of
such Assignment Agreement, as the case may be, in respect of payments to such
Lender.

          (iii) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax.
                -----------------------------------------------

                (a)  Each Lender that is organized under the laws of any
          jurisdiction other than the United States or any state or other
          political subdivision thereof (for purposes of this subsection
          2.7B(iii), a "Non-US Lender") shall deliver to Administrative Agent
          for transmission to Company, on or prior to the Effective Date, on or
          prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it
          becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and at such other
          times as may be necessary in the determination of Company or
          Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its
          discretion), (1) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
          1001 or 4224 (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly
          executed by such Lender, together with any other certificate or
          statement of exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code or the
          regulations issued thereunder to establish that such Lender is not
          subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income
          tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal,
          interest, fees or other amounts payable under any of the Loan
          Documents or (2) if such Lender is not a "bank" or other Person
          described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and cannot
          deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 pursuant to
          clause (1) above, a Certificate re Non-Bank Status together with two
          original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or any successor
          form), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together
          with any other certificate or statement of exemption required under
          the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations issued thereunder to
          establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding
          of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to
          such Lender of interest payable under any of the Loan Documents.

                                       68
<PAGE>

               (b)  Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or
          other evidence with respect to United States federal income tax
          withholding matters pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) hereby agrees,
          from time to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such
          forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or
          change in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other
          evidence obsolete or. inaccurate in any material respect, that such
          Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to Administrative Agent for
          transmission to Company two new original copies of Internal Revenue
          Service Form 1001 or 4224, or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two
          original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8, as the case may
          be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with
          any other certificate or statement of exemption required in order to
          confirm or establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or
          withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to
          payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents or (2) notify
          Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such
          forms, certificates or other evidence.

               (c)  Company shall not be required to pay any additional amount
          to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of subsection 2.7B(ii) if such
          Lender shall have failed to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) or
          (b)(l) of this subsection 2.7B(iii); provided that if such Lender
          shall have satisfied the requirements of subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) on or
          before the Effective Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement
          pursuant to which it became a Lender (in the case of each other
          Lender), nothing in this subsection 2.7B(iii)(c) shall relieve Company
          of its obligation to pay any additional amounts pursuant to clause (c)
          of subsection 2.7B(ii) in the event that, as a result of any change in
          any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order,
          or any change in the interpretation, administration or application
          thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms,
          certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the
          fact that such Lender is not subject to withholding as described in
          subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).

     C.   Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender shall have determined that
the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the date hereof of
any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding capital
adequacy, or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender
(or its applicable lending office) with any guideline, request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to,
such Lender's Loans or Commitments or Letters of Credit or participations
therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters
of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling
corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in,
applicability, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of
such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy),
then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt by Company from
such Lender of the

                                       69
<PAGE>

statement referred to in the next sentence, Company shall pay to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for such reduction. Such Lender
shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written
statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of
such additional amounts, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon
all parties hereto absent manifest error.

2.8  Obligation of Lenders and Issuing Lenders to Mitigate.
     -----------------------------------------------------

     Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable
after the officer of such Lender or Issuing Lender responsible for administering
the Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may
be, becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition
that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle
such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.7 or
subsection 3.6, it will, to the extent not inconsistent with the internal
policies of such Lender or Issuing Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory
restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make, issue, fund or maintain the
Commitments of such Lender or the affected Loans or Letters of Credit of such
Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letter of credit office of
such Lender or Issuing Lender, or (ii) take such other measures as such Lender
or Issuing Lender may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the circumstances
which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or
the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such
Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 would be
materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in its
sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such Commitments
or Loans or Letters of Credit through such other lending or letter of credit
office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not
otherwise materially adversely affect such Commitments or Loans or Letters of
Credit or the interests of such Lender or Issuing Lender; provided that such
Lender or Issuing Lender will not be obligated to utilize such other lending or
letter of credit office pursuant to this subsection 2.8 unless Company agrees to
pay all incremental expenses incurred by such Lender or Issuing Lender as a
result of utilizing such other lending or letter of credit office as described
in clause (i) above. A certificate as to the amount of any such expenses payable
by Company pursuant to this subsection 2.8 (setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender or Issuing Lender
to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

2.9  Defaulting Lenders.
     ------------------

     Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event
that any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") defaults (a "Funding Default") in its
obligation to fund any Revolving Loan (a "Defaulted Revolving Loan") in
accordance with subsection 2.1, then (i) during any Default Period (as defined
below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be
deemed not to be a "Lender" for purposes of voting on any matters (including the
granting of any consents or waivers) with respect to any of the Loan Documents,
(ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, until such time as the Default
Excess (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been
reduced to zero, (a) any voluntary prepayment of the Revolving Loans pursuant to
subsection 2.4B(i) shall, if Company so directs

                                       70
<PAGE>

at the time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Revolving
Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Revolving Loans
outstanding and the Revolving Loan Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were zero,
and (b) any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection
2.4B(iii) shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such mandatory
prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders (but not to the
Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender) as if such Defaulting Lender had
funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender, it being
understood and agreed that Company shall be entitled to retain any portion of
any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans that is not paid to such
Defaulting Lender solely as a result of the operation of the provisions of this
clause (b), (iii) such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment and
outstanding Revolving Loans and such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
Letter of Credit Usage shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the
commitment fee payable to Lenders pursuant to subsection 2.3A in respect of any
day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such
Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant
to subsection 2.3A with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Loan
Commitment in respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting
Lender, and (iv) the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments as at any
date of determination shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had
funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender.

     For purposes of this Agreement, (I) "Default Period" means, with respect to
any Defaulting Lender, the period commencing on the date of the applicable
Funding Default and ending on the earliest of the following dates: (A) the date
on which all Revolving Loan Commitments are cancelled or terminated and/or the
Obligations are declared or become immediately due and payable, (B) the date on
which (1) the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have
been reduced to zero (whether by the funding by such Defaulting Lender of any
Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender or by the non-pro rata
application of any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of the Revolving Loans in
accordance with the terms of this subsection 2.9 or by a combination thereof)
and (2) such Defaulting Lender shall have delivered to Company and
Administrative Agent a written reaffirmation of its intention to honor its
obligations under this Agreement with respect to its Revolving Loan Commitment,
and (C) the date on which Company, Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders
waive all Funding Defaults of such Defaulting Lender in writing, and (II)
"Default Excess" means, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the excess, if
any, of such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of Revolving Loans of all Lenders (calculated as if all
Defaulting Lenders (other than such Defaulting Lender) had funded all of their
respective Defaulted Revolving Loans) over the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender.

     No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection 2.9, performance by
Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result of any Funding Default
or the operation of this subsection 2.9. The rights and remedies against a
Defaulting Lender under this subsection 2.9 are in addition to other rights and
remedies which Company may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to
any Funding Default and which Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Funding Default.

2.10 Removal or Replacement of a Lender.
     ----------------------------------

     A.   Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
in the event that:

          (i)    (a) any Lender (an "Increased-Cost Lender") shall give notice
     to Company that such Lender is an Affected Lender or that such Lender is
     entitled to receive payments under subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6, (b)
     the circumstances which have caused such Lender to be an Affected Lender or
     which entitle such Lender to receive such payments shall remain in effect,
     and (c) such Lender shall fail to withdraw such notice within five Business
     Days after Company's request for such withdrawal; or

          (ii)   (a) any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, (b) the
     Default Period for such Defaulting Lender shall remain in effect, and (c)
     such Defaulting Lender shall fail to cure the default as a result of which
     it has become a Defaulting Lender within five Business Days after Company's
     request that it cure such default; or

          (iii)  (a) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification,
     termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions of
     this Agreement as contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of the first
     provision to subsection 10.6A, the consent of Requisite Lenders shall have
     been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders (each a
     "Non-Consenting Lender") whose consent is required shall not have been
     obtained, and (b) the failure to obtain Non-Consenting Lenders' consents
     does not result solely from the exercise of Non-Consenting Lenders' rights
     (and the withholding of any required consents by Non-Consenting Lenders)
     pursuant to the second provision to subsection 10.6A;

then, and in each such case, Company shall have the right, at its option, to
remove or replace the applicable Increased-Cost Lender, Defaulting Lender or
Non-Consenting Lender (the "Terminated Lender") to the extent permitted by
subsection 2.10B.

     B.   Company may, by giving written notice to Administrative Agent and any
Terminated Lender of its election to do so:

          (i)    elect to (a) terminate the Revolving Loan Commitment, if any,
     of such Terminated Lender upon receipt by such Terminated Lender of such
     notice and (b) prepay on the date of such termination any outstanding Loans
     made by such Terminated Lender, together with accrued and unpaid interest
     thereon and any other amounts payable to such Terminated Lender hereunder
     pursuant to subsection 2.3, subsection 2.6, subsection 2.7 or subsection
     3.6 or otherwise; provided that, in the event such Terminated Lender has
     any Loans outstanding at the time of such termination, the written consent
     of Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders (which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required in order for Company to
     make the election set forth in this clause (i); or

          (ii)   elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated
     Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its
     Revolving Loan Commitment, if any, in full to one or more Eligible
     Assignees (each a "Replacement

                                       72
<PAGE>

     Lender") in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.1B; provided
     that (a) on the date of such assignment, Company shall pay any amounts
     payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant to subsection 2.3, subsection
     2.6, subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 or otherwise as if it were a
     prepayment and (b) in the event such Terminated Lender is a Non-Consenting
     Lender, each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time of such
     assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Terminated Lender was a
     Non-Consenting Lender;

provided that (X) Company may not make either of the elections set forth in
clauses (i) or (ii) above with respect to any Non-Consenting Lender unless
Company also makes one of such elections with respect to each other Terminated
Lender which is a Non-Consenting Lender and (Y) Company may not make either of
such elections with respect to any Terminated Lender that is an Issuing Lender
unless, prior to the effectiveness of such election, Company shall have caused
each outstanding Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender to be cancelled.

     C.   Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender and
the termination of such Terminated Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, if any,
pursuant to clause (i) of subsection 2.10B, (i) Schedule 2.1 shall be deemed
modified to reflect any corresponding changes in the Revolving Loan Commitments
and (ii) such Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for
purposes of this Agreement; provided that any rights of such Terminated Lender
to indemnification under this Agreement (including under subsections 2.6D, 2.7,
3.6, 10.2 and 10.3) shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

                                  SECTION 3.
                               LETTERS OF CREDIT

3.1  Issuance of Letters of Credit and Lenders' Purchase of Participations
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Therein.
-------

     A.   Letters of Credit. Company acknowledges and confirms that Schedule 3.1
annexed hereto sets forth each letter of credit issued under the Existing Credit
Agreement and outstanding as of the Effective Date (collectively, the "Existing
Letters of Credit"). Company hereby represents, warrants, agrees, covenants and
(a) reaffirms that it is not aware of any defense, set off, claim or
counterclaim against any Agent or Lender in regard to its Obligations in respect
of such Existing Letters of Credit and (b) reaffirms its obligation to reimburse
the applicable Issuing Lenders for honored drawings under such Existing Letters
of Credit in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents applicable to Letters of Credit issued hereunder. Based on
the foregoing, Company and each Lender agrees that (1) each Existing Letter of
Credit which is a Standby Letter of Credit shall, as of the Effective Date, be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a Standby Letter of Credit
issued hereunder, and (2) each Existing Letter of Credit which is a Commercial
Letter of Credit shall, as of the Effective Date, be deemed for all purposes of
this Agreement to be a Commercial Letter of Credit issued hereunder. In addition
to Company requesting that Lenders make Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection
2.1A(iii) and that Swing Line Lender make Swing Line Loans pursuant to
subsection 2.1A(iv), Company may request, in accordance with the provisions of
this subsection 3.1, from time to time during the period from the Effective Date
to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, that one or
more Lenders

                                       73
<PAGE>

issue Letters of Credit for the account of Company for the purposes specified in
the definitions of Commercial Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit;
provided that all such Commercial Letters of Credit shall provide for sight
drawings. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance
upon the representations and warranties of Company herein set forth, any one or
more Lenders may, but (except as provided in subsection 3.1B(ii)) shall not be
obligated to, issue such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of
this subsection 3.1; provided that Company shall not request that any Lender
issue (and no Lender shall issue):

          (i)   any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance,
     the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments would exceed the
     Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect;

          (ii)  any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance,
     the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $10,000,000;

          (iii) any Standby Letter of Credit having an expiration date later
     than the earlier of (a) five Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan
     Commitment Termination Date and (b) the date which is one year from the
     date of issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit; provided that the
     immediately preceding clause (b) shall not prevent any Issuing Lender from
     agreeing that a Standby Letter of Credit will automatically be extended for
     one or more successive periods not to exceed one year each unless such
     Issuing Lender elects not to extend for any such additional period; and
     provided, further that such Issuing Lender shall elect not to extend such
     Standby Letter of Credit if it has knowledge that an Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing (and has not been waived in accordance with
     subsection 10.6) at the time such Issuing Lender must elect whether or not
     to allow such extension; provided, however, that notwithstanding clause (a)
     but restrictions of this subsection, Company may request the issuance (on a
     date prior to five Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment
     Termination Date) of a Standby Letter of Credit having an expiration date
     later than five Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment
     Termination Date if Company, at the time of such request, makes
     arrangements in form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing Lender
     thereof to cash collateralize such Letter of Credit provided that Issuing
     Lender shall be under no obligation to issue such a Letter of Credit if it
     shall reasonably determine that such cash collateralization arrangements
     could reasonably be expected to be less favorable to Issuing Lender than
     the reimbursement arrangements hereunder with respect to other Letters of
     Credit;

          (iv)  any Commercial Letter of Credit having an expiration date (a)
     later than the earlier of (X) the date which is 30 days prior to the
     Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and (Y) the date which is 180
     days from the date of issuance (on a date prior to 30 days prior to the
     Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date) of such Commercial Letter of
     Credit or (b) that is otherwise unacceptable to the applicable Issuing
     Lender in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, notwithstanding clause
     (X) but subject to the other restrictions of this subsection, Company may
     request the issuance (on a date prior to 30 days prior to the Revolving
     Loan Commitment Termination Date) of a Commercial Letter of Credit having
     an expiration date later than the time set forth in clause (X) if Company,
     at the time of such request, makes arrangements in form and

                                       74
<PAGE>

     substance satisfactory to the Issuing Lender thereof to cash collateralize
     such Letter of Credit; provided further that, Issuing Lender shall be under
     no obligation to issue such a Letter of Credit if it shall reasonably
     determine that such cash collateralization arrangements could reasonably be
     expected to be less favorable to Issuing Lender than the reimbursement
     arrangements hereunder with respect to other Letters of Credit; or

          (v)  any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to the issuance
     thereof, the Total Utilization of Commitments exceeds the Adjusted
     Borrowing Base Amount then in effect.

     B.   Mechanics of Issuance.

          (i)  Notice of Issuance. Whenever Company desires the issuance of a
     Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of
     Issuance of Letter of Credit substantially in the form of Exhibit III
     annexed hereto no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least three
     Business Days (in the case of Standby Letters of Credit) or five Business
     Days (in the case of Commercial Letters of Credit), or in each case such
     shorter period as may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender in any particular
     instance, in advance of the proposed date of issuance. The Notice of
     Issuance of Letter of Credit shall specify (a) the proposed date of
     issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (b) whether the Letter of Credit
     is to be a Standby Letter of Credit or a Commercial Letter of Credit, (c)
     the face amount of the Letter of Credit, (d) in the case of a Letter of
     Credit which Company requests to be denominated in a currency other than
     Dollars, the currency in which Company requests such Letter of Credit to be
     issued, (e) the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, (f) the name and
     address of the beneficiary, and (g) either the verbatim text of the
     proposed Letter of Credit or the proposed terms and conditions thereof,
     including a precise description of any documents to be presented by the
     beneficiary which, if presented by the beneficiary prior to the expiration
     date of the Letter of Credit, would require the Issuing Lender to make
     payment under the Letter of Credit; provided that the Issuing Lender, in
     its reasonable discretion, may require changes in the text of the proposed
     Letter of Credit or any such documents; and provided, further that no
     Letter of Credit shall require payment against a conforming draft to be
     made thereunder on the same business day (under the laws of the
     jurisdiction in which the office of the Issuing Lender to which such draft
     is required to be presented is located) that such draft is presented if
     such presentation is made after 10:00 A.M. (in the time zone of such office
     of the Issuing Lender) on such business day.

     Company shall notify the applicable Issuing Lender (and Administrative
Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such Issuing Lender) prior to the issuance
of any Letter of Credit in the event that any of the matters to which Company is
required to certify in the applicable Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit is
no longer true and correct as of the proposed date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit, and upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit Company shall be deemed to
have re-certified, as of the date of such issuance, as to the matters to which
Company is required to certify in the applicable Notice of Issuance of Letter of
Credit.

          (ii) Determination of Issuing Lender. Upon receipt by Administrative
     Agent of a Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit pursuant to subsection
     3.1B(i) requesting the

                                       75
<PAGE>

     issuance of a Letter of Credit, in the event Administrative Agent elects to
     issue such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify
     Company, and Administrative Agent shall be the Issuing Lender with respect
     thereto. In the event that Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion,
     elects not to issue such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall
     promptly so notify Company, whereupon Company may request any other Lender
     to issue such Letter of Credit by delivering to such Lender a copy of the
     applicable Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit. Any Lender so requested
     to issue such Letter of Credit shall promptly notify Company and
     Administrative Agent whether or not, in its sole discretion, it has elected
     to issue such Letter of Credit, and any such Lender which so elects to
     issue such Letter of Credit shall be the Issuing Lender with respect
     thereto. In the event that all other Lenders shall have declined to issue
     such Letter of Credit, notwithstanding the prior election of Administrative
     Agent not to issue such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall be
     obligated to issue such Letter of Credit and shall be the Issuing Lender
     with respect thereto, notwithstanding the fact that the Letter of Credit
     Usage with respect to such Letter of Credit and with respect to all other
     Letters of Credit issued by Administrative Agent, when aggregated with
     Administrative Agent's outstanding Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans,
     may exceed Administrative Agent's Revolving Loan Commitment then in effect;
     provided that Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to issue any
     Letter of Credit denominated in a foreign currency which in the judgment of
     Administrative Agent is not readily and freely available.

          (iii)  Issuance of Letter of Credit. Upon satisfaction or waiver (in
     accordance with subsection 10.6) of the conditions set forth in subsection
     4.4, the Issuing Lender shall issue the requested Letter of Credit in
     accordance with the Issuing Lender's standard operating procedures.

          (iv)   Notification to Lenders. Upon the issuance of any Letter of
     Credit the applicable Issuing Lender shall promptly notify Administrative
     Agent and each other Lender of such issuance, which notice shall be
     accompanied by a copy of such Letter of Credit. Promptly after receipt of
     such notice (or, if Administrative Agent is the Issuing Lender, together
     with such notice), Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the
     amount of such Lender's respective participation in such Letter of Credit,
     determined in accordance with subsection 3.1C.

          (v)    Reports to Lenders. Within 15 days after the end of each
     calendar quarter ending after the Effective Date, so long as any Letter of
     Credit shall have been outstanding during such calendar quarter, each
     Issuing Lender shall deliver to each other Lender a report setting forth
     for such calendar quarter the daily aggregate amount available to be drawn
     under the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender that were
     outstanding during such calendar quarter.

     C.   Lenders' Purchase of Participations in Letters of Credit. Immediately
upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender having a Revolving Loan
Commitment shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably purchased
from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and any
drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share
(with respect to the Revolving Loan Commitments) of the

                                       76
<PAGE>

maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn
thereunder. On the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, the Issuing
Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, irrevocably repurchase from
each Lender such Lender's participation in the Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Lender pursuant to the last proviso to subsection 3.1A(iii) or the last
proviso to subsection 3.1A(iv) to the extent any such Letter of Credit remains
outstanding and any amounts remain undrawn thereunder.

3.2  Letter of Credit Fees.
     ---------------------

     Company agrees to pay the following amounts with respect to Letters of
Credit issued hereunder:

          (i)   with respect to each Standby Letter of Credit, (a) a fronting
     fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account,
     equal to 1/8 of 1% per annum of the daily amount available to be drawn
     under such Standby Letter of Credit and (b) a letter of credit fee, payable
     to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders having Revolving Loan
     Exposure, equal to the product of (x) the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin
     and (y) the daily amount available to be drawn under such Standby Letter of
     Credit, each such fronting fee or letter of credit fee to be payable in
     arrears on and to (but excluding) each March 15, June 15, September 15 and
     December 15 of each year and computed on the basis of a 360-day year for
     the actual number of days elapse d;

          (ii)  with respect to each Commercial Letter of Credit, (a) a fronting
     fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account,
     equal to 1/8 of 1% per annum of the daily amount available to be drawn
     under such Commercial Letter of Credit and (b) a letter of credit fee,
     payable to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders having Revolving
     Loan Exposure, equal to the product of (x) the Applicable Eurodollar Rate
     Margin and (y) the daily amount available to be drawn under such Commercial
     Letter of Credit, each such fronting fee or letter of credit fee to be
     payable in arrears on and to (but excluding) each March 15, June 15,
     September 15 and December 15 of each year and computed on the basis of a
     360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed; and

          (iii) with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer of each
     Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made thereunder (without
     duplication of the fees payable under clauses (i) and (ii) above),
     documentary and processing charges payable directly to the applicable
     Issuing Lender for its own account in accordance with such Issuing Lender's
     standard schedule for such charges in effect at the time of such issuance,
     amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may be.

For purposes of calculating any fees payable under clauses (i) and (ii) of this
subsection 3.2, (1) the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of
Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of
determination and (2) any amount described in such clauses which is denominated
in a currency other than Dollars shall be valued based on the applicable
Exchange Rate for such currency as of the applicable date of determination.
Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount described in clause
(i)(b) or (ii)(b) of this

                                       77
<PAGE>

subsection 3.2, Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender its Pro
Rata Share of such amount.

3.3  Drawings and Reimbursement of Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     A.   Responsibility of Issuing Lender With Respect to Drawings. In
determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to examine the
documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care so as to
ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

     B.   Reimbursement by Company of Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit. In
the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a Letter of
Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall immediately notify Company and
Administrative Agent, and Company shall reimburse such Issuing Lender on or
before the Business Day immediately following the date on which such drawing is
honored (the "Reimbursement Date") in an amount in Dollars (which amount, in the
case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit which is denominated in a currency
other than Dollars, shall be calculated by reference to the applicable Exchange
Rate) and in same day funds equal to the amount of such honored drawing;
provided that, anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) unless Company shall have notified Administrative Agent and
such Issuing Lender prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date such
drawing is honored that Company intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the
amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving
Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely Notice of Borrowing to
Administrative Agent requesting Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are Base
Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars (which amount, in
the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit which is denominated in a
currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated by reference to the applicable
Exchange Rate) equal to the amount of such honored drawing and (ii) subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in subsection 4.3B, Lenders
shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans
in the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied
directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount
of such honored drawing; and provided, further that, if for any reason proceeds
of Revolving Loans are not received by such Issuing Lender on the Reimbursement
Date in an amount equal to the amount of such honored drawing, Company shall
reimburse such Issuing Lender, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal
to the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of
such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this subsection
3.3B shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Revolving
Loans on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Company shall
retain any and all rights it may have against any Lender resulting from the
failure of such Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this subsection 3.3B.

     C.   Payment by Lenders of Unreimbursed Amounts Paid Under Letters of
Credit.

          (i)   Payment by Lenders. In the event that Company shall fail for any
     reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender as provided in subsection 3.3B in an
     amount (calculated,

                                       78
<PAGE>

     negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender.

          (ii)  Distribution to Lenders of Reimbursements Received From Company.
     In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Lenders

     Person or, in the case of a Lender, against Company, whether in connection
     with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated

jurisdiction).

     --------------------------------------------------

fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal
counsel) which such Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence,
direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing
Lender, other than as a result of (a) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Issuing Lender as determined by a final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction or (b) subject to the following clause (ii), the
wrongful dishonor by such Issuing Lender of a proper demand for payment made
under any Letter of Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing
Lender to honor a drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any act
or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or
de facto government or governmental authority (all such acts or omissions herein
called "Governmental Acts").

foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for: (i) the form,
validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document
submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of
any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all
respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) so long as such Issuing Lender
complies with its responsibilities under subsection

                                       81
<PAGE>

3.3A, failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully
with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv)
errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be
in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or
delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make
a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising
from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Lender, including any
Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the
vesting of, any, of such Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

     In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific
provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5B, any action
taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with the Letters
of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder,
if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender under any
resulting liability to Company.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection 3.5,
Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against any Issuing Lender
for any liability arising out of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Issuing Lender, as determined by a final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction.

3.6  Increased Costs and Taxes Relating to Letters of Credit.
     -------------------------------------------------------

     Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling
with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Issuing
Lender or Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest
error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any
law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or
in the interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the
introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order),
or any determination of a court or governmental authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by any Issuing Lender or
Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date
hereof by any central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law):

          (i)   subjects such Issuing Lender or Lender (or its applicable
     lending or letter of credit office) to any additional Tax (other than any
     Tax on the overall net income of such Issuing Lender or Lender) with
     respect to the issuing or maintaining of any Letters of Credit or the
     purchasing or maintaining of any participations therein or any other
     obligations under this Section 3, whether directly or by such being imposed

     marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special
     deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement in respect
     of any Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participations
     therein purchased by any Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not

     matter) on or affecting such Issuing Lender or Lender (or its applicable
     lending or letter of credit office) regarding this Section 3 or any Letter
     of Credit or any participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Issuing
Lender or Lender of agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or agreeing to purchase, purchasing or maintaining any participation
therein or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Issuing Lender or
Lender (or its applicable lending or letter of credit office) with respect

the additional amounts owed to such Issuing Lender or Lender under this
subsection 3.6, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto absent manifest error.

                                  SECTION 5.
            HOLDINGS' AND COMPANY'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     In order to induce Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the
Loans, to induce Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit and to induce other
Lenders to purchase participations therein, Holdings and Company represent and
warrant to each Lender, on the date of this Agreement, on each Funding Date and
on the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, that the following statements
are true, correct and complete:

5.1  Organization, Powers. Qualification. Good Standing, Business and
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
Subsidiaries.
------------

     A.   Organization and Powers. Each Corporate Loan Party is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and each Partnership Loan Party is a duly
organized and validly existing partnership under the laws of its jurisdiction of
formation and is in good standing in such jurisdiction in each case as of the
Effective Date as specified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto. Each Loan Party has
all requisite corporate or partnership (as applicable) power and authority to
own and operate its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a
party and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby.

     B.   Qualification and Good Standing. Each Corporate Loan Party is
qualified to do business and in good standing, and each Partnership Loan Party
is authorized as a foreign partnership to do business, in every jurisdiction
where its assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out its business
and operations, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing has not had and will not have a Material Adverse Effect.

     C.   Conduct of Business. Holdings and its Subsidiaries are engaged only in
the businesses permitted to be engaged in pursuant to subsection 7.13.

     D.   Subsidiaries. All of the Subsidiaries of Holdings as of the Effective
Date are identified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto. The capital stock or other
equity interests of each of Holdings' Subsidiaries any portion of which is
pledged under the Collateral Documents is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and none of such capital stock or other equity interests
constitutes Margin Stock. The limited and general partnership interests of each
of the Subsidiaries identified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto which are limited
partnerships are duly and validly issued. Each of the Subsidiaries of Holdings
is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization or formation, has all
requisite corporate, limited liability company or partnership power and
authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is qualified to do business and
in good standing in every jurisdiction where its assets are located and wherever
necessary to carry out its business and operations, in each case except where
failure to be so qualified or in good standing or a lack of such corporate,
limited liability company or partnership power and authority has not had and
will

                                       90
<PAGE>

not have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (as so
supplemented) correctly sets forth, as of the Effective Date, the ownership
interest of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries of
Holdings identified therein.

5.2  Authorization of Borrowing, etc.
     -------------------------------

     A.   Authorization of Borrowing. The execution, delivery and performance of
the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate, limited
liability company and/or partnership (as applicable) action on the part of each
Loan Party that is a party thereto.

     B.   No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by Loan Parties
of the Loan Documents to which they are parties and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents do not (i) violate any provision
of any law or any governmental rule or regulation applicable to Holdings or any
of its Subsidiaries, the Certificate or Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or
other analogous organizational document) of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
or any order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of government
binding on Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a
breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under any Contractual Obligation of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any
Permitted Encumbrances or Liens, created under any of the Loan Documents in
favor of Collateral Agent) or (iv) require any approval of stockholders or
partners or any approval or consent of any Person under any Contractual
Obligation of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or
consents which will be obtained on or before the Effective Date and disclosed in
writing to Lenders or the failure of which to obtain could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     C.   Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and performance by Loan
Parties of the Loan Documents to which they are parties and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents do not require any
registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to,
with or by, any federal, state or other governmental authority or regulatory
body except to the extent obtained or made and except for those filings
necessary to perfect Liens under the Collateral Documents, other than filings to
effect releases of Liens on or promptly after the Effective Date and other
filings made in the ordinary conduct of business. The execution, delivery and
performance by Loan Parties of the Related Agreements to which they are parties
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Related Agreements
in the manner set forth therein do not require any registration with, consent or
approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any federal, state or
other governmental authority or regulatory body except (i) to the extent
obtained or made or (ii) where the failure to obtain or make any of the
foregoing, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     D.   Binding Obligation. Each of the Loan Documents has been duly executed
and delivered by each Loan Party that is a party thereto and is the legally
valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan
Party in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

     Company enforceable against Company in accordance with their respective
     terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
     moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights
     generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability. The Senior
     Notes were, when issued, either (a) registered or qualified under
     applicable federal and state securities laws or (b) exempt therefrom.

          (iii) Senior Discount Debentures. The Senior Discount Debentures have
     been duly issued by Holdings and paid for and are the legally valid and
     binding obligations of Holdings, enforceable against Holdings in accordance
     with their respective terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or
     limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
     enforceability. The Senior Discount Debentures were, when issued, either

5.16  Matters Relating to Collateral.
      ------------------------------

      A.  Creation, Perfection and Priority of Liens. Except as otherwise set
forth therein, or in Schedule 5.16, of this Agreement the execution and delivery
of the Collateral Documents by Loan Parties, together with (i) the actions taken
on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to subsections 4.2, 6.8 and 6.9 or
contemplated to be taken thereby and (ii) the delivery to Collateral Agent of
any Pledged Collateral not delivered to Collateral Agent at the time of
execution and delivery of the applicable Collateral Document (all of which
Pledged Collateral shall have been so delivered) are effective to create in
favor of Collateral Agent for the benefit of Lenders, as security for the
respective Secured Obligations (as defined in the applicable Collateral Document
in respect of any Collateral), a valid and perfected first priority Lien (other
than those Liens permitted pursuant to Section 7.2(A)(i), (viii) and (ix)) on
all of the Collateral, in each case subject to Permitted Encumbrances and Liens
permitted under subsection 7.2, and, except as otherwise set forth in the
Collateral Documents, all filings and other actions necessary or desirable to
perfect and maintain the perfection and first priority status of such Liens have
been duly made or taken and remain in full force and effect (other than the
filing of UCC financing continuation statements).

     B.   Governmental Authorizations. No authorization, approval or other
action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or
regulatory body is required for either (i) the pledge or grant by any Loan Party
of the Liens purported to be created in favor of Collateral Agent pursuant to
any of the Collateral Documents or (ii) the exercise by Collateral Agent of any
rights or remedies in respect of any Collateral (whether specifically granted or
created pursuant to any of the Collateral Documents or created or provided for
by applicable law), except for filings or recordings contemplated by subsection
5.16A and except as may be required, in connection with the disposition of any
Pledged Collateral, by laws generally affecting the offering and sale of
securities or vessels.

     C.   Absence of Third-Party Filings. Except such as may have been filed in
favor of Collateral Agent as contemplated by subsection 5.16A, (i) no effective
UCC financing statement, fixture filing or other instrument similar in effect
covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file in any filing or recording
office, except with respect to Permitted Encumbrances and Liens permitted under
subsection 7.2A, and (ii) no effective filing covering all or any part of the IP
Collateral is on file in the PTO.

     D.   Margin Regulations. The pledge of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to
the Collateral Documents does not violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

         Holdings' discovery of any occurrence or condition on any real property
         adjoining or in the vicinity of any material Facility that would

         thereof to be subject to any material restrictions on the ownership,
         occupancy, transferability or use thereof under any Environmental Laws,

         Claims that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
         the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (2) affect the ability of

         obligations or requirements under any Environmental Laws where such
         obligations or reimbursements would reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

      Administrative Agent may reasonably request, and (b) if required by
      Administrative Agent, an opinion of counsel (which counsel shall be
      reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent) in the state in which
      such Additional Mortgaged Property is located with respect to the

      reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, insuring fee simple title
      to, or a valid leasehold interest in, such Additional Mortgaged Property
      vested in such Loan Party and assuring Administrative Agent that such

      mortgage Lien on such Additional Mortgaged Property, subject only to
      standard survey exceptions, which Additional Mortgage Policy (1) shall
      include an endorsement for mechanics' liens, for future advances (in each

encumbered to secure payment of particular Indebtedness or to be sold pursuant

Agreement which would be adverse to Lenders, without the prior written consent
of Requisite Lenders under this Agreement.

available to them under any of the Loan Documents, even if the conditions set
forth in this paragraph are met.

      No remedy herein conferred upon any Lender or the Administrative Agent is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision
of law.

contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as applicable. The
provisions of this Section 9 are solely for the benefit of Agents and Lenders
and Company shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the
provisions thereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement,
each Agent shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall
not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency
or trust with or for Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Lead Arranger
and Syndication Agent, without consent of or notice to any party hereto, may
assign any and all of its rights or obligations hereunder to any of its
Affiliates. As of the date on which Syndication Agent notifies Company that it
has concluded its primary syndication of the Loans and Commitments, all
obligations of GSCP, in its capacity as Syndication Agent hereunder, shall
terminate. GSCP, in its capacity as Lead Arranger, shall not have any
obligations hereunder.

      B.  Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents. It is the purpose of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no violation of
any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking
corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such
jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement

                                      137
<PAGE>

of any of the Loan Documents, or in case Collateral Agent deems that by reason
of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the
rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents
or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection
therewith, it may be necessary that Collateral Agent appoint an additional
individual or institution as a separate trustee, co-trustee, collateral agent or
collateral co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being
referred to herein individually as a "Supplemental Collateral Agent" and
collectively as "Supplemental Collateral Agents").

      In the event that Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental Collateral
Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege
or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to Collateral Agent with
respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental
Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such
Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges
with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such
Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents
and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental
Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either Administrative Agent
or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 9
and of subsections 10.2 and 10.3 that refer to Collateral Agent shall inure to
the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral Agent and all references therein to
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to Collateral Agent and/or
such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require.

      Should any instrument in writing from Holdings, Company or any other Loan
Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by
Collateral Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him
or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, Holdings or Company shall, or
shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all
such instruments promptly upon request by Administrative Agent. In case any
Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, to the extent permitted by
law, shall vest in and be exercised by Collateral Agent until the appointment of
a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

9.2   Powers and Duties; General Immunity.
      -----------------------------------

      A.  Powers; Duties Specified. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each
Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to exercise such powers,
rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as are
specifically delegated or granted to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers, rights and remedies as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Each Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities that are
expressly specified in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Agent
may exercise such powers, rights and remedies and perform such duties by or
through its agents or employees. No Agent shall have, by reason of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, a fiduciary relationship in
respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to
impose upon any Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

                                      138
<PAGE>

      B.  No Responsibility for Certain Matters. No Agent shall be responsible
to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements
made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statements or in any
financial or other statements, instruments, reports or certificates or any other
documents furnished or made by any of Agent to Lenders or by or on behalf of
Holdings or Company to any Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loan
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the financial
condition or business affairs of Holdings or Company or any other Person liable
for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall any Agent be required to ascertain
or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions,
provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Loan Documents or as
to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or as to the existence or possible
existence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default. Anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Administrative
Agent shall not have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of
outstanding Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts
thereof.

      C.  Exculpatory Provisions. None of Agents nor any of their respective
officers, partners, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders
for any action taken or omitted by any Agent under or in connection with any of
the Loan Documents except to the extent caused by such Agent's gross negligence
or willful misconduct. Each Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or
the taking of any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection
with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or from the exercise of
any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless
and until such Agent, in the case of any Agent other than the Administrative
Agent, shall have received instructions in respect thereof from Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions
under subsection 10.6) or, in the case of the Administrative Agent, in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, and, upon receipt of such
instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be)
or in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as the case may be, such
Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or
to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such
instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and
shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and
judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Holdings and its Subsidiaries),
accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a result
of such Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from acting under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, in the case of any Agent other
than the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the instructions of Requisite
Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions
under subsection 10.6) or, in the case of the Administrative Agent, in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

      D.  Agent Entitled to Act as Lender. The agency hereby created shall in no
way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or
obligations upon, any Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder.
With respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters of Credit, each
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as

                                      139
<PAGE>

any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the
duties and functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise
indicates, include each Agent in its individual capacity. Any Agent and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with Holdings,
Company or any of their Affiliates as if it were not performing the duties
specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from Holdings and
Company for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without
having to account for the same to Lenders.

9.3   Representations and Warranties; No Responsibility For Appraisal of
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Creditworthiness.
      ----------------

      Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Loans and the issuance of
Letters of Credit hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its
own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Holdings and its Subsidiaries. No Agent
shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing
basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders
or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect
thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at
any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any responsibility with
respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to
Lenders.

9.4   Right to Indemnity.
      ------------------

      Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally agrees to
indemnify each Agent, to the extent that such Agent shall not have been
reimbursed by Company or Holdings, for and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
such Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its
duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity
as such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that arise from such Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished to any Agent for
any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become
impaired, such Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not
commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished; provided that in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to
indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty,
action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Lender's
Pro Rata Share thereof; and provided, further, that this sentence shall not be
deemed to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability,
obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or
disbursement described in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence.

9.5   Successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender.
      ----------------------------------------------------

                                      140
<PAGE>

     A.   Successor Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Company, and
Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by an
instrument or concurrent instruments in writing delivered to Company and
Administrative Agent and signed by Requisite Lenders. Upon any such notice of
resignation or any such removal, Requisite Lenders shall have the right, upon
five Business Days' notice to Company, to appoint a successor Administrative
Agent with the consent of Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent and the
retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring or removed Administrative
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions
of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

     B.   Successor Swing Line Lender. Any resignation or removal of
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall also constitute the
resignation or removal of Fleet or its successor as Swing Line Lender, and any
successor Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall, upon
its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Swing Line Lender for
all purposes hereunder. In such event (i) Company shall prepay any outstanding
Swing Line Loans made by the retiring or removed Agent in its capacity as Swing
Line Lender, (ii) upon such prepayment, the retiring or removed Administrative
Agent and Swing Line Lender shall surrender any Swing Line Note held by it to
Company for cancellation, and (iii) if so requested by the successor
Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender in accordance with subsection 2.1E,
Company shall issue a new Swing Line Note to the successor Administrative Agent
and Swing Line Lender substantially in the form of Exhibit VIII annexed hereto,
in the principal amount of the Swing Line Loan Commitment then in effect and
with other appropriate insertions.

     C.   Administrative Agent under Term Loan Credit Agreement. Any resignation
or removal of Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall also
constitute the resignation or removal of Fleet for all purposes hereunder and
under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.

9.6  Collateral Documents and Guaranty.
     ---------------------------------

     Each Lender hereby further authorizes Administrative Agent, on behalf of
and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, and
each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
provided that Administrative Agent shall not enter into or consent to any
material amendment, modification, termination or waiver of the Intercreditor
Agreement without the prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders
as may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6). Each Lender
hereby further authorizes Collateral Agent (and under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement Collateral Agent is authorized), on behalf of and for
the benefit of Lenders, to enter into each Collateral Document as secured party
and to be the agent for and representative of the Lenders under the Guaranties,
and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each Collateral Document and
each

                                      141
<PAGE>

Guaranty; provided that Collateral Agent shall not enter into or consent to
any material amendment, modification, termination or waiver of the Intercreditor
Agreement without the prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders
as may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6); provided
further, however, that, without further written consent or authorization from
Lenders, Collateral Agent may execute any documents or instruments necessary to
(a) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of a
sale or other disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement or as permitted
or required under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Collateral Documents or to
which Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such
consent under subsection 10.6) have otherwise consented or (b) release any
Subsidiary Guarantor from the Subsidiary Guaranty if all of the capital stock of
such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold to any Person pursuant to a sale or other
disposition permitted hereunder or as permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be
required to give such consent under subsection 10.6) have otherwise consented;
provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall require consent to
release from the Subsidiary Guaranty any Person which, immediately after such
sale, shall be a Subsidiary of Holdings which is obligated to and will enter
into the Subsidiary Guaranty. Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to
the contrary notwithstanding, Company, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent
and each Lender hereby agree that (X) no Lender shall have any right
individually to realize upon any of the Collateral under any Collateral Document
or to enforce the Subsidiary Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all
powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents and the Guaranties
may be exercised solely by Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties
in accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y) in the event of a foreclosure by
Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale,
Collateral Agent or any Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of such
Collateral at any such sale and Collateral Agent, as agent for and
representative of Secured Parties (but not any Secured Party or Secured Parties
in its or their respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall
otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and
making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the
Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations
as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by
Collateral Agent at such sale.

Lenders, and the Collateral Agent to enter into the Bain Intercreditor Agreement
and the Reaffirmation of Intercreditor Agreement. Each Lender agrees to be bound
by the terms of the Bain Intercreditor Agreement and the Reaffirmation of
Intercreditor Agreement; provided that Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent shall not enter into or consent to any material amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of the Bain Intercreditor Agreement or the reaffirmation
of Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or
such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection
10.6).

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

10.1 Assignments and Participations in Loans and Letters of Credit.
     -------------------------------------------------------------

     A.   General. Subject to subsection 10.1B, each Lender shall have the right
at any time to (i) sell, assign or transfer to any Eligible Assignee, or (ii)
sell participations to any Person in, all or any part of its Commitments or any
Loan or Loans made by it or its Letters of Credit or participations therein or
any other interest herein or in any other Obligations owed to it; provided that
no such sale, assignment, transfer or participation shall, without the consent
of Company, require Company to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify such sale, assignment, transfer or
participation under the securities laws of any state; provided, further that no
such sale, assignment or transfer described in clause (i) above shall be
effective unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting such sale,
assignment or transfer shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent and
recorded in the Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii); provided, further
that no such sale, assignment, transfer or participation of any Letter of Credit
or any participation therein may be made separately from a sale, assignment,
transfer or participation of a corresponding interest in the Revolving Loan
Commitment and the Revolving Loans of the Lender effecting such sale,
assignment, transfer or participation; and provided, further that, anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Swing Line Loan Commitment
and the Swing Line Loans of Swing Line Lender may not be sold, assigned or
transferred as described in clause (i) above to any Person other than a
successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender to the extent contemplated
by subsection 9.5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 10.1, no
Lender shall, as between Company and such Lender, be relieved of any of its
obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any
granting of participations in, all or any part of its Commitments or the Loans,
the Letters of Credit or participations therein, or the other Obligations owed
to such Lender.

     B.   Assignments.

          (i)  Amounts and Terms of Assignments. Each Commitment, Loan, Letter
     of Credit or participation therein, or other Obligation may (a) be assigned
     in any amount to another Lender, or to an Affiliate or Approved Fund of the
     assigning Lender or another Lender, with the giving of notice to Company
     and Administrative Agent, or (b) be assigned in an aggregate amount of not
     less than $2,000,000 (or such lesser amount as shall constitute the
     aggregate amount of the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit and
     participations therein, and other Obligations of the assigning Lender and
     its Affiliates) to any other Eligible Assignee with the consent of Company
     and Administrative Agent (which consent of Company and Administrative Agent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that, unless
     otherwise agreed to in writing by Company and Administrative Agent or
     unless such assignment is for the assigning Lender's entire interest
     hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the assigning Lender shall
     have, immediately after giving effect to such assignment, not less than an
     aggregate amount of $2,000,000 in Commitments, Loans and Letter of Credit;
     and provided further, however, that (x) upon the occurrence and during the
     continuance of an Event of Default, or (y) in the case of assignments by
     GSCP or Fleet, assignments may be made without the consent

                                      143
<PAGE>

     of Company, upon the giving of notice to Company and Administrative Agent
     (and compliance with the other conditions set forth in subsection 10.1). To
     the extent of any such assignment in accordance with either clause (a) or
     (b) above, the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations with
     respect to its Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participations
     therein, or other Obligations or the portion thereof so assigned. The
     parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative
     Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment
     Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of $500 in the
     case of assignments pursuant to clause (a) above and assignments by GSCP or
     Fleet and $2000 in the case of all other assignments and such forms,
     certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to United States
     federal income tax withholding matters as the assignee under such
     Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent and
     the Company pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a). Upon such execution,
     delivery, acceptance and recordation, from and after the effective date
     specified in such Assignment Agreement, (y) the assignee thereunder shall
     be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
     have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have
     the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (z) the assigning
     Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
     hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement,
     relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination
     of this Agreement under subsection 10.9B) and be released from its
     obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment
     Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's
     rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be
     a party hereto; provided that, anything contained in any of the Loan
     Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if such Lender is the Issuing
     Lender with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit such Lender shall
     continue to have all rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender with
     respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of
     such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn
     thereunder). The Commitments hereunder shall be modified to reflect the
     Commitment of such assignee and any remaining Commitment of such assigning
     Lender and, if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of any Notes
     hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such
     assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its
     applicable Notes, if any, to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and
     thereupon new Notes shall, if so requested by the assignee and/or the
     assigning Lenders in accordance with Subsection 2.1E, be issued to the
     assignee and/or to the assigning Lender, substantially in the form of
     Exhibit IV or Exhibit V annexed hereto, as the case may be, with
     appropriate insertions, to reflect the new Commitments, as the case may be,
     of the assignee and/or the assigning Lender.


          (ii) Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in Register. Upon
     its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and
     an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with the
     processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection 10.1B(i) and any
     forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal
     income tax withholding matters that such assignee may be required to
     deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a),
     Administrative Agent shall, if Administrative Agent has and Company have
     consented to the assignment evidenced thereby (in each case to the extent
     such consent is required

                                      144
<PAGE>

     pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment Agreement by
     executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which acceptance shall
     evidence any required consent of Administrative Agent to such assignment),
     (b) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (c) give
     prompt notice thereof to Company. Administrative Agent shall maintain a
     copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as
     provided in this subsection 10.1B(ii).

     C.   Participations. The holder of any participation, other than an
Affiliate of the Lender granting such participation, shall not be entitled to
require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except action
directly affecting (i) the extension of the scheduled final maturity date of any
Loan allocated to such participation (ii) a reduction of the principal amount of
or the rate of interest or fees payable on any Loan allocated to such
participation, and all amounts payable by Company hereunder (including amounts
payable to such Lender pursuant to subsections 2.6D, 2.7 and 3.6) or (iii) a
release of all or substantially all of the Collateral. Company and each Lender
hereby acknowledge and agree that, solely for purposes of subsections 10.4 and
10.5, (a) any participation will give rise to a direct obligation of Company to
the participant and (b) the participant shall be considered to be a "Lender".

     D.   Assignments to Federal Reserve Banks and Fund Trustees. In addition to
the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of
this subsection 10.1, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its
Loans, the other Obligations owed to such Lender, and its Notes to any Federal
Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating circular issued by
such Federal Reserve Bank, and with the consent of Company and Administrative
Agent any Lender which is an investment fund may pledge all or any portion of
its Notes or Loans to its trustee in support of its obligations to such trustee;
provided that (i) no Lender shall, as between Company and such Lender, be
relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment
and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such Federal Reserve Bank or trustee be
considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to
take or omit to take any action hereunder.

     E.   Information. Each Lender may furnish any information concerning
Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender from time to time
to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants), subject to subsection 10.19.

     F.   Representations of Lenders. Each Lender listed on the signature pages
hereof hereby represents and warrants (i) that it is an Eligible Assignee
described in clause (a) of the definition thereof; (ii) that it has experience
and expertise in the making of or investing in loans such as the Loans; and
(iii) that it will make its Loans for its own account in the ordinary course of
its business and without a view to distribution of such Loans within the meaning
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it
being understood that, subject to the provisions of this subsection 10.1, the
disposition of such Loans or any interests therein shall at all times remain
within its exclusive control). Each Lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant
to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree that the representations and
warranties of such Lender contained in Section 2(c) of such Assignment Agreement
are incorporated herein by this reference.

10.3 Indemnity.
     ---------

     In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to subsection 10.2, whether
or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Company agrees to
defend (subject to Indemnitees' selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold
harmless Agents and Lenders, and the officers, partners, directors, trustees,
employees, agents and affiliates of any of Agents and Lenders (collectively
called the "Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities
(as hereinafter defined); provided that Company shall not have any obligation to
any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, bad faith
or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined by a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

     As used herein, "Indemnified Liabilities" means, collectively, any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages (including natural resource damages),
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims (including Environmental Claims),
costs (including the costs of any investigation, study, sampling, testing,
abatement, cleanup, removal, remediation or other response action necessary to
remove, remediate, clean up or abate any Hazardous Materials Activity), expenses
and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel for Indemnitees in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened by
any Person, whether or not any such Indemnitee shall be designated as a party or
a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses incurred by Indemnitees in
enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether
based on any federal, state or foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations
(including securities and commercial laws, statutes, rules or regulations and
Environmental Laws), on common law or equitable cause or on contract or
otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such
Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents or the Related Agreements transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (including Lenders' agreement to make the Loans hereunder or
the use or intended use of the proceeds thereof or the issuance of Letters of
Credit hereunder or the use or intended use of any thereof, or any enforcement
of any of the Loan Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guaranties)),
(ii) the statements contained in the commitment letter executed by such Lender
and the Company with respect thereto, or (iii) any Environmental Claim or any
Hazardous Materials Activity relating to or arising from, directly or
indirectly, any past or present activity, operation, land ownership, or practice
of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender
other than an Existing Lender shall have any entitlement for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 10.3 with respect to any claim based upon a breach of a
representation or warranty under any of subsections 5.2E.(i) through (iii) or
5.17B. of this Agreement.

     To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold
harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in whole or in
part because they are violative of any law or public policy, Company shall
contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to

                                      147
<PAGE>

pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

10.4 Set-Off; Security Interest in Deposit Accounts.
     ----------------------------------------------

     In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and
not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by Company
at any time or from time to time subject to the consent of Administrative Agent,
without notice to Company or to any other Person (other than Administrative
Agent), any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including
Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured,
but not including trust accounts or payroll accounts) and any other Indebtedness
at any time held or owing by that Lender to or for the credit or the account of
Company against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of Company
which are then due and payable to that Lender under this Agreement, the Letters
of Credit and participations therein and the other Loan Documents, including all
claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein or any other Loan
Document, irrespective of whether or not that Lender shall have made any demand
hereunder which are then due and payable. Company hereby further grants to
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and each Lender a security interest in
all deposits and accounts maintained with Administrative Agent or such Lender as
security for the Obligations.

     Company, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereby
acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this subsection 10.4 are subject to
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that any Lender is
required pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement to turn over
to the Administrative Agent any payments otherwise subject to the provisions of
this subsection 10.4, such payments shall not be subject to the provisions of
this subsection 10.4.

10.5 Ratable Sharing.
     ---------------

     Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall, whether by
voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon security,
through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim
or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or
otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral
under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the
aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in respect of Letters
of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to that Lender hereunder or
under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate Amounts Due" to
such Lender) which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender
in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify Administrative
Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a
portion of such payment to purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to
have purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon the
receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts
Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of

                                      148
<PAGE>

Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the
Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided that, if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or
otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for
such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest Company expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased
may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with
respect to any and all monies owing by Company to that holder with respect
thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation
held by that holder.

     Company, the Lenders and Administrative Agent hereby acknowledge and
agree that the provisions of this subsection 10.5 are subject to the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that any Lender is required
pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement to turn over to the
Administrative Agent any payments otherwise subject to the provisions of this
subsection 10.5, such payments shall not be subject to the provisions of this
subsection 10.5.

the Loan Documents, or consent to any departure by Company therefrom, shall in

hereunder, or extend the time for payment of any such interest or fees, or
reduce the principal amount of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation in

consent of such Lender (it being understood that no

                                      149
<PAGE>

amendment, modification or waiver of any condition precedent, covenant,

portion of any Commitment of any Lender shall constitute an increase in such
Commitment of such Lender); (2) amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision
of subsection 2.1A(iv) or any other provision of this Agreement relating to the

prepayment so long as the application, as between Classes, of any portion of
such prepayment which is still required to be made is not altered.

     B.   Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the
concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or
consents on behalf of that Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only

are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.

thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,

10.13    Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders' Rights.
         ----------------------------------------------------------

         The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender hereunder.
Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action taken by
Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders as a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The
amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and
independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its

         This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements
hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of counterparts

classified as a "C" corporation under the Internal Revenue Code and to give
effect to the intent of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents after
consummation of any such conversion. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
reimbursement by Company of its reasonable fees and expenses incurred in

priority Lien in the Collateral shall remain in full force and effect to the
same extent as prior to such conversion.

         The Company, Holdings, the Lenders, and the Agents agree that as of the
Effective Date (a) the terms and provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement
shall be and hereby are amended, superseded and restated in their entirety by
the terms and provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that all
representations and warranties made by Holdings and Company under the Existing
Credit Agreement as of the dates on which such representations and warranties
were made by Holdings or Company, shall survive such amendment, supersession and
restatement and the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (b) the Lenders
and the Agents shall not have any obligations under the Existing Credit
Agreement, except to the extent that any such obligations may be restated in
this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, and (c) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall not constitute or effect, or be deemed to
constitute or effect, a novation, refinancing, discharge, extinguishment or
refunding of any of the "Obligations" (as defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement) or that portion of the Obligations which remain outstanding under
this Agreement.

                                      155

         Without limiting the foregoing, upon the Effective Date, (i) no Event
of Default under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be deemed to arise solely
as a result of the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (ii) the Existing Defaults and Incipient Defaults shall no longer be deemed
to exist; provided, that, nothing contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be
deemed to, alter, affect, prejudice, waive, relinquish or impair any right or
remedy that the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may have under this
Agreement on or after the Effective Date, including, without limitation, the
right to declare an Event of Default under Section 8 hereof, or any other
provision of this Agreement, that is based, in whole or in part, on any fact,
circumstance, act, omission, transaction, occurrence or other event which
occurred prior to the Effective Date (other than those which constitute Existing
Defaults and Incipient Defaults).

Document to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and this Credit
Agreement is in full force and effect as of the Effective Date, (iii) Holdings,
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not challenge or dispute the validity of any
of the Obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents or
this Agreement, (iv)as of the Effective Date, Company is justly and lawfully
liable to the Lenders in an aggregate principal amount of the Loans of
$[525,625,000] (as set forth on Schedule 2.1), plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, plus fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Obligations as provided herein and in the other Loan Documents, and (v) by

each case, without any offset, counterclaim or defense of any kind.

Agreement has been negotiated in good faith, at arm's length, and not by any
means prohibited by law.

10.26    No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

         -------

         In further consideration of the execution by the Agents and the

assigns of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Releasors"), hereby
completely, voluntarily, knowingly, and unconditionally releases, acquits, and

(a) each of the Agents, (b) each of the Lenders, (iii) each of the Subsidiaries,
parents, holding companies, Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, and other representatives of each of
the foregoing, and (d) all of the successors and assigns of each of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Releasees"), from any and all claims, actions,

liabilities, damages, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills,
specialties, variances, trespasses, judgments, extents, executions, rights,
obligations, losses, undertakings, costs, expenses, attorneys' fees, setoffs,
counterclaims, cross-claims, third-party claims, claims-over, reimbursement
claims, indemnity claims, contribution claims, and demands of any and every type
whatsoever, including, without limitation, any so-called "lender liability"
claims or defenses (collectively, "Claims"), whether arising out of federal,

whether in law or in equity, whether known or unknown, matured or unmatured,
fixed or contingent, asserted or unasserted, disclosed or undisclosed,
liquidated or unliquidated, disputed or undisputed, suspected or unsuspected,
foreseen or unforeseen, direct or indirect, choate or inchoate, whether
individual, class, derivative, representative, or in any other capacity, which
any of the Releasors ever had, now has or hereinafter can, shall or may have
against any of the Releasees for, upon or by reason of any matter, cause or
thing whatsoever prior to the Effective Date, in any way concerning, relating
to, or arising from (i) any of the Releasors, (ii) the Obligations or the
Existing Obligations, (iii) the Collateral, (iv) the Existing Credit Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, (v) the financial condition, business
operations, business plans, prospects or creditworthiness of Holdings, Company

nothing in this section 10.27 shall limit or prejudice the right of Company to
challenge the reasonableness of any fees and expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Date that are submitted to the Company for reimbursement. Each of the
Releasors knowingly grants such release notwithstanding that such Releasor may
hereafter discover facts in addition to, or different from, those which that
party now knows or believes to be true, and without regard to the subsequent
discovery or existence of such different or additional facts, and expressly
waives any and all rights that any such Releasor may have under any statute,
procedural rule, common law principle or equity which would limit the effect of
the foregoing release to those Claims actually known or suspected to exist at
the time of the Effective Date. The Releasors hereby acknowledge that they have
been advised by legal counsel of the meaning and consequences of this release.
