give rise to compensation to a Member from a third party, including, without
limitation, workers&#146; compensation and automobile insurance. VISTA shall be subrogated

payments as permitted under applicable law and this Agreement. MSO shall and shall
cause MSO Providers to use their best efforts to determine whether a Member has any
benefits as described above or whether a third party may be responsible for payment.
MSO shall and shall cause MSO Providers to assist VISTA in coordination of benefits by
(i)&nbsp;requiring a Member so covered to sign all necessary documents to give effect to
this Section&nbsp;2.3; and (ii)&nbsp;signing any other documents and providing any information
and records so requested by VISTA at no cost to VISTA. Unless otherwise required by
law, neither MSO nor MSO Providers shall be entitled to reimbursement by any third
party for Provider Services rendered to Members, including, Medicare intermediaries or
carriers, and all sums recovered pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.3 shall be retained by
VISTA. Unless required by law or the applicable VISTA Coverage Plan, in the event VISTA
is the primary carrier, payments made by VISTA to an MSO Provider plus allowed
Co-Payments, Deductibles and Co-Insurance shall be deemed payment in full for all
services rendered by MSO and MSO Providers hereunder. In the event VISTA is the
secondary carrier (except in the case of Medicare or where otherwise provided by law),
VISTA, as applicable, shall pay for all services rendered to Members in accordance with
the applicable VISTA Provider Agreement and applicable law that were not paid by the
primary carrier; provided, however, that the combined payments made by the primary and
secondary carriers shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the compensation due
MSO Provider under the applicable Provider Contract or VISTA Provider Agreement, as
applicable. If VISTA is the secondary carrier to Medicare, VISTA&#146;s liability shall be

law.</TD>

VISTA, or breach of this Agreement, shall any MSO Provider or any employee or
contractor of MSO, bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation,
remuneration or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against Members or persons

to this Agreement, including but not limited to any and all amounts equal to the
difference between MSO Providers&#146; Billed Charge for a Covered Service and the
applicable Allowance for the particular Covered Service. Additionally, MSO shall not
and shall ensure that neither any MSO Provider nor any employee or contractor of MSO
collects or attempts to collect money from, maintains any action at law against, or
reports to a credit agency a Member for payment of a claim for a Covered Service for
which VISTA is liable if MSO Provider in good faith knows or should know that VISTA
is liable in accordance with Florida law, including, but not limited to pended claims
submitted by MSO Providers to VISTA for payment of the services and any legal
proceedings or dispute resolution process to determine whether VISTA is liable for
the services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement does not prohibit MSO
Provider from collecting Co-Payments, Deductibles and Co-Insurance, as specifically
provided in the applicable VISTA Coverage Plan, or fees for non- Covered Services
delivered on a fee-for-service basis to Members. Nor does this Agreement prohibit MSO
Provider and a Member from agreeing to continue services solely at the expense of the
Member, as long as MSO Provider clearly informed the Member in advance and in writing
that VISTA might not cover or continue to cover such specific service(s). MSO shall
ensure that MSO Providers bill Members directly for any applicable Co-Payments,
Deductibles and Co-Insurance at the time Covered Services are rendered. MSO further
agrees that this Section&nbsp;2.4 (i)&nbsp;shall survive the termination of this Agreement
regardless of the cause giving rise to such termination and shall be construed to be
for the benefit of Members; and (ii)&nbsp;supersedes any oral or written agreement to the
contrary now existing or hereafter entered into between MSO or an MSO Provider and a
Member or persons acting on a Member&#146;s behalf. MSO agrees and shall cause MSO
Providers to agree that if non- Covered Services are to be provided to Members, it is
MSO Provider&#146;s responsibility to inform the Member in writing prior to the provision
of such non-Covered Services that such services are not Covered Services and that the
Member will be responsible for payment for such non-Covered Services and to collect
the fees for such non- Covered Services directly from the Member. In the event that
the Member is not so informed, MSO agrees and shall cause MSO Providers to agree that
the Member shall not be liable to MSO or MSO Providers for payment for such
non-Covered Services.</TD>

    <TD><U><B>Non-Solicitation of Members</B></U><B>. </B>MSO recognizes and agrees
that VISTA has a valuable business relationship with each of its Members and,
further, that MSO and MSO Providers stand in a position to influence Members&#146;
decisions concerning insurers and health maintenance organizations. In
recognition of VISTA&#146;s valuable business relationships with its Members, MSO
agrees that, during the Term, and upon termination of this Agreement for any
reason whatsoever, MSO shall not and shall ensure that MSO Providers shall not
solicit Members, directly or indirectly, to enroll in any other health
maintenance organization, health insurance or health coverage or alternative
health care delivery system. MSO&#146;s obligation not to solicit Members is a
material inducement for MSO&#146;s engagement by VISTA pursuant to
this Agreement.
This Section&nbsp;11.1.6, however, is not intended to interfere with a Member&#146;s right
to freely select a Provider or alternative health coverage subsequent to
termination of this Agreement. Further, MSO acknowledges and agrees that any and
all marketing or solicitation communication with Medicare Members and Medicaid
Members must be approved in advance of dissemination by CMS or AHCA, as
applicable, in accordance with applicable requirements.</TD>

result to VISTA in the event of MSO&#146;s breach of these covenants, that a material
inducement for MSO&#146;s engagement by VISTA are the covenants set forth in this
Section&nbsp;11.1, and that monetary damages in an action at law would not provide an
adequate remedy in the event of a breach of this Section&nbsp;11.1. MSO further
acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section&nbsp;11.1 are
necessary for the protection of VISTA&#146;s legitimate business and professional
duties, ethical obligations, and interests and are reasonable in scope and
content. Accordingly, in the event of MSO&#146;s breach of (i)&nbsp;this Section&nbsp;11.1, or
any part of this Section&nbsp;11.1, this Section&nbsp;11.1 may be enforced by the obtaining
of an injunction to restrain the violation thereof by MSO and all persons acting
for or with MSO; or (ii)&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.1.6, as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction, MSO shall pay to VISTA and amount equal to one thousand two hundred
dollars ($1,200) for each Member MSO inappropriately solicits, directly or
indirectly, to enroll in any other health maintenance organization, health
insurance or health coverage or alternative health care delivery system in
violation of Section&nbsp;11.1.6, in addition to all other remedies VISTA may have at

any other document and providing any other information or records so requested by VISTA at

shall be retained by VISTA. Unless required by law or the applicable VISTA Coverage Plan, in

to Members in accordance with this Agreement and applicable law that were not paid by the
primary carrier, provided, however, that the combined payments made by the primary and
secondary carriers shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the compensation due PCP
by VISTA under <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.1</U> of this Agreement. If VISTA is the secondary carrier to
