</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN AND AGREEMENT (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made and entered into as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;) between and among ProAssurance Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (&#147;ProAssurance&#148;), and its subsidiary, ProAssurance Group Services Corporation, an
Alabama corporation (&#147;PGSC&#148;), and Victor T. Adamo, an individual (&#147;Adamo&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><U><B>RECITALS:</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adamo has served as the president and as a director of ProAssurance since 2001. He is
currently an &#147;at will&#148; employee of PGSC, which is a subsidiary of ProAssurance and serves as the
employer for certain employees of ProAssurance and its subsidiaries (collectively the &#147;Companies&#148;).
ProAssurance, PGSC and Adamo are parties to a Release and Severance Compensation Agreement dated
as of January&nbsp;1, 2008 (the &#147;Severance Agreement&#148;), which extended the term of the severance
benefits first granted to Adamo in 2002. Under the terms of the Severance Agreement, Adamo may
elect to terminate his employment with the Companies for any reason at any time prior to December
31, 2010, and receive severance compensation (&#147;Severance Compensation&#148;) from ProAssurance in an
amount equal to the sum of two times Adamo&#146;s current annual base salary and the average of the
annual incentive compensation paid to him for the three calendar years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009,
2008 and 2007. Adamo and ProAssurance have had discussions regarding ProAssurance&#146;s desire for
Adamo to continue as a senior executive of ProAssurance. ProAssurance and Adamo recognize that
Adamo is of retirement age and the continuation of Adamo&#146;s employment in such circumstances would
result in a financial detriment to Adamo because the opportunity for him to retire and receive
Severance Compensation pursuant to the Severance Agreement will terminate on December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an inducement for Mr.&nbsp;Adamo to continue as a senior executive after 2010, ProAssurance has
agreed to pay the Severance Amount pursuant to a deferred compensation plan to be established for
the account of Adamo in consideration for his agreement to terminate the Severance Agreement and to
continue to be employed by the Companies in a mutually agreeable capacity as an employee at will.
The deferred compensation will be payable to Adamo upon termination of his employment with the
Companies for any reason subject only to the following conditions: (i)&nbsp;Adamo will execute a
release in favor of the Companies as a condition to payment of the deferred compensation; and (ii)
Adamo will agree not to compete with the Companies during his employment and for a period of three
years after termination of his employment as set forth in Section&nbsp;8 hereof. The parties have
entered into this Agreement to terminate the Severance Agreement and to set forth the terms and
conditions for the continued employment of Adamo as a senior executive of ProAssurance and for the
payment of deferred compensation on his termination of employment. It is understood and agreed
that the termination of the Severance Agreement and the payment of the Severance Amount as deferred
compensation hereunder will not accelerate or delay the time that the Severance Amount would

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Termination of Severance Agreement</U>. The Severance Agreement is hereby terminated
and shall have no further force and effect from and after the Effective Date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Employment of Adamo</U>. Adamo shall be employed as an executive of ProAssurance on
such terms as shall be established from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer of
ProAssurance; provided that Adamo shall be entitled to benefits substantially similar to the
benefits provided to employees of the Companies that are similarly situated to Adamo in his then
current capacity. Adamo shall be an &#147;at will&#148; employee of the Companies and ProAssurance may
terminate the employment of Adamo at any time for any reason and Adamo may terminate his employment
at any time for any reason. On any termination of employment with the Companies, Adamo shall be
entitled to the following in addition to and not in limitation of the Severance Amount (as defined
in Section&nbsp;3 hereof): (i)&nbsp;accrued and unpaid base salary as of the date of termination of
employment; (ii)&nbsp;accrued vacation and sick leave, if any, as of the date of termination of
employment in accordance with the then current policy of the Companies; and (iii)&nbsp;vested benefits
under the Companies&#146; employee benefit plans in which Adamo was a participant on the date of
termination of employment, which vested benefits shall be paid or provided for in accordance with
the terms of said employee benefit plans.

and Adamo agree to vest and defer the payment of $1,680,000 (the &#147;Severance
Amount&#148;) which represents a mutually agreed reduction to the Severance Compensation that would be
due to Adamo under the Severance Agreement if Adamo elected to terminate his employment with the
Companies on the Effective Date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;ProAssurance agrees to defer for the benefit of Adamo the Severance Amount in
consideration of the termination of the Severance Agreement and the covenant not to compete set
forth in Section&nbsp;8 hereof. Upon the written request of Adamo, ProAssurance will cause funds in an
amount equal to the Severance Amount to be invested in an investment vehicle that accepts funds to
be paid as nonqualified deferred compensation, in which event the Severance Amount as herein
defined shall be adjusted to reflect the cumulative earnings or losses on such investment to the
date of payment of the Severance Amount. ProAssurance shall pay Adamo the Severance Amount, as so
adjusted, in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in Section 3(c) hereof upon
termination of Adamo&#146;s relationship with the Companies as an officer, employee and director.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Adamo understands and agrees that the payment of the Severance Amount is subject to and

Severance Amount shall be payable to Adamo in good funds in seventy-eight (78)&nbsp;equal installments
payable on each payroll payment date according to the ProAssurance bi-weekly payroll practice
during the Restricted Period (as defined in Section&nbsp;8 hereof) commencing on the first payroll

subject to and conditioned upon the execution of the Release by the Designated Beneficiary and the
personal representative of the estate of Adamo within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after termination of

of designation, executed by Adamo, to ProAssurance (as provided in Section&nbsp;11 hereof) in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;B hereto. ProAssurance shall provide timely notice to
the Designated Beneficiary, if any, of the existence of this Agreement and the requirements of this
Section&nbsp;4. In the event Adamo fails to designate a person as Designated Beneficiary as herein
permitted, the &#147;Designated Beneficiary&#148; for purposes of this Agreement will be Adamo&#146;s surviving
spouse or, if none, Adamo&#146;s estate.

benefit due under Section&nbsp;3 hereof is deemed &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation&#148; subject to 409A
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), and as of the date of Adamo&#146;s &#147;separation
from service&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;1.409A-3(a)(1) of the Treasury Regulations), Adamo is a
&#147;specified employee&#148; (in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations), then
such portion will be paid (without interest) on the first business day that is six months after the
date of Adamo&#146;s &#147;separation from service.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Any reference in this Agreement to a &#147;termination of employment,&#148; &#147;termination,&#148; &#147;date of
termination,&#148; &#147;Termination Date&#148; or similar reference to a cessation of services shall be
interpreted to mean a &#147;Separation from Service&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;1.409A-1(h) of the
Treasury Regulations. This Agreement shall be administered and interpreted to maximize the
short-term deferral exception to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, and Adamo shall not, directly or
indirectly, designate the taxable year of a payment made under this Agreement. The portion of any
payment under this Agreement that is not a &#147;deferral of compensation&#148; and is paid within the
&#147;short-term deferral period&#148; within the meaning of Treasury Regulation &#167; 1.409A-1(b)(4) shall be
treated as a short-term deferral and not aggregated with other deferred compensation plans or
payments. Any other portion of the payment that does not meet the short-term deferral requirement
shall, to the maximum extent possible, be deemed to satisfy the exception from Treasury Regulation
&#167; 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) for involuntary separation pay and shall not be aggregated with any other
payment. Any amount that is a short-term deferral within the meaning of Treasury Regulation &#167;
1.409A-1(b)(4), or within the involuntary separation pay limit under Treasury Regulation &#167;
1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be treated as a separate payment. Payment dates provided for in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be timely paid if paid within any additional time for payment
following the specified payment date as is permitted under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that any in-kind payments or reimbursements
provided to Adamo under this Agreement are deemed to constitute deferred compensation to Adamo,
such amounts shall be paid or reimbursed by the deadline for payment or reimbursement specified in
this Agreement but, if not so specified, reasonably promptly, but not later than December&nbsp;31 of the
year following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of any in-kind payments or
expense reimbursements that constitute deferred compensation in one year shall not affect the
amount of payments or expense reimbursements constituting deferred compensation that are eligible
for payment or reimbursement in any subsequent year, and Adamo&#146;s right to such payments or
reimbursement of any such expenses shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other
benefit.

necessary to comply with the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code.

of the Code and that payments made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will not be
subject to the excise tax under Section&nbsp;409A of the Code.
ProAssurance agrees that it will report the payments or benefits payable under this Agreement

successors in interest, or be taken in execution by levy, attachment or garnishment or by any other
legal or equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any right to alienate, anticipate,

person hereunder shall be limited to the right to receive the benefits as set forth herein. To the
extent that Adamo or any other person acquires a right to receive any benefit under this Agreement,
such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of ProAssurance.
For tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA, this Agreement is intended to qualify as an
unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select
group of management or highly compensated employees, and shall be interpreted accordingly. No
action by ProAssurance or its Board of Directors, or the Administrator under this Agreement
(herein defined) shall be construed as creating a trust, escrow or other secured or segregated fund
or other fiduciary relationship of any kind in favor of Adamo or any Designated Beneficiary or any
other persons otherwise entitled to benefits under this Agreement. The status of Adamo and any
Designated Beneficiary with respect to any liabilities assumed by ProAssurance hereunder shall be
solely that of unsecured creditors. The Agreement constitutes a promise by ProAssurance to make
benefit payments in the future. Any insurance policy or any other asset acquired or held by
ProAssurance in connection with liabilities assumed by it hereunder, shall not be deemed to be held
under any trust, escrow or other secured or segregated fund or other fiduciary relationship of any
kind for the benefit of Adamo or any Designated Beneficiary or to be security for the performance
of the obligations of ProAssurance, but shall be and remain a general, unpledged, unrestricted

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;<U>Claims Procedure</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The administrator for purposes of this Agreement shall be ProAssurance (&#147;Administrator&#148;),
whose address is 100 Brookwood Place, Birmingham, Alabama 35209; Telephone: (205)&nbsp;877-4400. The
&#147;Named Fiduciary&#148; as defined in Section 402(a) (2)&nbsp;or ERISA, also shall be ProAssurance.
ProAssurance shall have the right to designate one or more employees of the Companies as the
Administrator and the Named Fiduciary at any time, and to change the address and telephone number
of the same. ProAssurance shall give Adamo written notice of any change in the Administrator and
Named Fiduciary, or in the address or telephone number of the same.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Administrator shall make all determinations as to the right of any person to receive
benefits under the Agreement. Any denial by the Administrator of a claim for benefits by Adamo
(&#147;the claimant&#148;) shall be stated in writing by the Administrator and delivered or mailed to the
claimant within ten (10)&nbsp;days after receipt of the claim, unless special circumstances require an
extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension is required, written notice of
the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial 10-day
period. In no event shall such extension exceed a period of ten (10)&nbsp;days from the end of the
initial period. Any notice of denial shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial, specific
reference to pertinent provisions of this Agreement upon which the denial is based, a description
of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim, with an
explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and any explanation of claim review
procedures, written to the best of the Administrator&#146;s ability in a manner that may be understood
without legal or actuarial counsel.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;A claimant whose claim for benefits has been wholly or partially denied by the
Administrator may request, within ten (10)&nbsp;days following the receipt of such denial, in a writing
addressed to the Administrator, a review of such denial. The claimant shall be entitled to submit
such issues or comments in writing or otherwise, as the claimant shall consider relevant to a
determination of the claim, and the claimant may include a request for a hearing in person before
the Administrator. Prior to submitting the request, the claimant shall be entitled to review such
documents as the Administrator shall agree are pertinent to the claim. The claimant may, at all
stages of review, be represented by counsel, legal or otherwise, of the claimant&#146;s choice. All
requests for review shall be promptly resolved. The Administrator&#146;s decision with respect to any
such review shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the claimant not later than ten
(10)&nbsp;days following receipt by the Administrator of the claimant&#146;s request unless special
circumstances, such as the need to hold a hearing, require an extension of time for processing, in
which case the Administrator&#146;s decision shall be so mailed not later than twenty (20)&nbsp;days after
receipt of such request.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;<U>Arbitration</U>. The parties to this Agreement agree that final and binding
arbitration shall be the sole recourse to settle any claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to a breach or the interpretation of this Agreement, except as either party may be seeking
injunctive relief. Either party may file for arbitration. A claimant seeking relief on a claim
for benefits, however, must first follow the procedure in Section&nbsp;12 hereof and may file for
arbitration within sixty (60)&nbsp;days following claimant&#146;s receipt of the Administrator&#146;s written
decision on review under Section 12(c) hereof, or if the Administrator fails to provide any written
decision under Section&nbsp;12

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">hereof, within 60&nbsp;days of the date on which such written decision was
required to be delivered to the claimant as therein provided. The arbitration shall be held at a
mutually agreeable location, and shall be subject to and in accordance with the arbitration rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association; provided that if the location cannot be
agreed upon the arbitration shall be held in Birmingham, Alabama. The arbitrator may award any and
all remedies allowable by the cause of action subject to the arbitration, but the arbitrator&#146;s sole
authority shall be to interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement. In reaching its
decision the arbitrator shall have no authority to change or modify any provision of this Agreement
or other written agreement between the parties. The arbitrator shall have the power to compel the
attendance of witnesses at the hearing. Any court having jurisdiction may enter a judgment based
upon such arbitration. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties
without appeal to any court. Upon execution of this Agreement, Adamo shall be deemed to have
waived any right to commence litigation proceedings regarding this Agreement outside of arbitration
or injunctive relief without the express consent of ProAssurance. ProAssurance and Adamo shall
each be responsible for one-half of the arbitration fees and the arbitrator&#146;s compensation, and
each of them shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of their respective legal counsel.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;<U>Termination</U>. This Agreement shall be terminated automatically if: (i)&nbsp;Adamo fails
to execute the Release within twenty-two (22)&nbsp;days after termination of employment; or (ii)&nbsp;Adamo
revokes the Release within seven (7)&nbsp;days after his execution of the Release. In the event this
Agreement is so terminated, none of the parties shall have any further rights or obligations
hereunder, it being understood that the Severance Amount shall not be payable as a result of
Adamo&#146;s failure to timely execute the Release without revocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Adamo&#146;s employment is terminated by reason of his death or if Adamo should die after termination
of employment with the Companies prior to completion of the payment of the Severance Amount and if
the Designated Beneficiary and the personal representative of Adamo&#146;s estate fail to execute the
Release as required in Section&nbsp;4 hereof or if either of them revokes the Release within seven (7)
days after execution thereof, this Agreement shall be terminated automatically and no further
payments shall be made hereunder on the sooner of either: (A)&nbsp;sixty-eight (68)&nbsp;days after the date
of delivery of the notice required under Section 4(d) hereof or (B)&nbsp;180&nbsp;days after the death of
Adamo.

alienation, assignment, pledge, collateralization or attachment of any benefits under this
Agreement shall be valid or recognized by the Companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Neither the provisions of this Agreement nor the severance benefits provided hereunder

Adamo&#146;s rights as an employee of the Companies, whether existing now or hereafter, under any
benefit, incentive, retirement, stock option, stock bonus or stock purchase plan, or any other plan
or arrangement, nor shall it diminish or eliminate any indemnity agreement between Adamo and any of
the Companies or any rights of Adamo under the Companies&#146; governing documents or under applicable
