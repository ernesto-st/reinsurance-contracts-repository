                                TERMS OF THE LOAN

SECTION 2.1 LOAN.

      (A)   LOAN. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Loan Agreement and
in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Borrowers contained
herein, Lender agrees to lend to the Borrowers, and the Borrowers agree to
borrow from Lender, a loan in the original principal amount of $109,999,900 (the
"LOAN") comprised of Component A and Component B.

      (B)   NOTE. On the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver
to Lender Note A and Note B.

      (C)   USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loan funded at Closing shall be
used to (i) refinance existing indebtedness; (ii) pay all recording fees and
taxes, title insurance premiums, the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Lender, including reasonable legal fees and expenses of counsel to
Lender, and other costs and expenses approved by Lender (which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld) related to the Loan; (iii) establish the Reserves
required hereunder; and (iv) provide for general corporate purposes, including,
without limitation, payment of transaction costs and expenses incurred by the
Borrowers. The remaining proceeds of the Loan, if any, shall be disbursed to or
as otherwise directed by the Borrowers.

                                       25
<PAGE>

      (D)   MODIFICATION OF COMPONENTS. Lender shall have the right, at Lender's
sole cost (other than each Borrower's internal costs and expenses and the costs
and expenses of the Borrowers' counsel), any time prior to a Securitization, to
modify the Loan in order to create additional components, reduce the number of
Components, reallocate the principal balances of the Components, change the
Interest Rates of the Components or eliminate the component structure of the
Loan provided that as of the effective date of such modification (i) the total
principal balance of the Loan equals the outstanding principal balance of the
Loan immediately prior to such modification, (ii) the aggregate monthly interest
payment does not exceed the aggregate monthly amount of the interest payment
required prior to such modification and (iii) the aggregate monthly principal
amortization does not exceed the aggregate monthly principal amortization
required prior to such modification. Lender shall have the right to modify the
Components in accordance with this Section 2.1.(D) upon notice to Borrower (in
which event such modification shall then be deemed effective). If requested by
Lender, Borrower shall promptly execute an amendment to this Agreement and the
Note to evidence such modification.

SECTION 2.2 INTEREST.

      (A)   RATE OF INTEREST. The outstanding principal balance of each
Component shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in
effect for such Component.

      (B)   DEFAULT RATE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default and in any event from and after
the Maturity Date of the Loan and until the Loan and all other Obligations are
satisfied in full, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and all other
Obligations shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum that is
four percent (4%) in excess of the Interest Rate otherwise applicable under this
Loan Agreement and the Note (the "DEFAULT RATE").

      (C)   COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the Loan and all other
Obligations owing to Lender shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year,
and shall be charged for the actual number of days elapsed during any month or
other accrual period. Interest shall be payable in arrears (except with respect
to the number of days from the Payment Date in any Interest Accrual Period to
the last day of such Interest Accrual Period, as to which interest shall be
payable in advance, if any).

      (D)   INTEREST LAWS. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained in this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers
shall not be required to pay, and Lender shall not be permitted to collect, any
amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by law
("EXCESS INTEREST"). If any Excess Interest is provided for or determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have been provided for in this Loan Agreement
or in any of the other Loan Documents, then in such event: (1) the provisions of
this subsection shall govern and control; (2) the Borrowers shall not be
obligated to pay any Excess Interest; (3) any Excess Interest that Lender may
have received hereunder shall be, at Lender's option, (a) applied as a credit
against either or both of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan or
accrued and unpaid interest thereunder (not to exceed the maximum amount
permitted by law), (b) refunded to the payor thereof, or (c) any combination of
the foregoing; (4) the interest rate(s) provided for herein shall be
automatically reduced to the maximum lawful rate allowed from time to time under
applicable law (the "MAXIMUM RATE"), and this Loan

                                       26
<PAGE>

Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been and shall
be, reformed and modified to reflect such reduction; and (5) the Borrowers shall
not have any action against Lender for any damages arising out of the payment or
collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any
period of time interest on any Obligation is calculated at the Maximum Rate
rather than the applicable rate under this Loan Agreement, and thereafter such
applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable
on such Obligations shall, to the extent permitted by law, remain at the Maximum
Rate until Lender shall have received or accrued the amount of interest which
Lender would have received or accrued during such period on Obligations had the
rate of interest not been limited to the Maximum Rate during such period. If the
Default Rate shall be finally determined to be unlawful, then the Interest Rate
shall be applicable during any time when the Default Rate would have been
applicable hereunder, provided however that if the Maximum Rate is greater or
lesser than the Interest Rate, then the foregoing provisions of this paragraph
shall apply.

      (E)   LATE CHARGES. If an Event of Default regarding non-payment of
principal, interest or other sums due hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents shall occur, then the Borrowers shall pay to Lender, in addition to
all sums otherwise due and payable, a late fee in an amount equal to five
percent (5.0%) of such principal, interest or other sums due hereunder or under
any other Loan Document, such late charge to be immediately due and payable
without demand by Lender.

SECTION 2.3 INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT.

      (A)   As a condition to Closing, the Borrowers shall purchase and pledge
and deliver to Lender an interest rate cap agreement satisfying the criteria set
forth below (the "CAP"), and the Borrowers shall maintain such Cap in the
possession of Lender, in full force and effect, until all Obligations are fully
and finally repaid. The Cap (i) shall have a notional amount equal to the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan calculated based upon the declining
principal balance of the Loan scheduled to be outstanding over the term of such
Cap taking into account scheduled principal amortization hereunder, (ii) shall
provide that to the extent that the LIBO Rate exceeds five percent (5%) per
annum (the "CAP THRESHOLD RATE"), then the Cap Provider shall pay to Lender, on
behalf of the Borrowers, not less than the amount of interest that would accrue
on the Loan at a per annum rate equal to the difference between the LIBO Rate
and the Cap Threshold Rate, (iii) shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lender, (iv) shall have a term equal to the Initial Term of the
Loan (or the applicable Extension Term), and (v) shall be issued by a financial
institution (the "CAP PROVIDER") having a financial rating by S&P of at least
"AA-" (and at least an equivalent rating from each of the other Rating
Agencies).

      (B)   If at any time the financial rating assigned to any Cap Provider by
S&P shall fall below AA- (or the equivalent rating for any other Rating Agency),
the Borrowers shall be required to deliver a replacement Cap in substantially
the form of the Cap delivered at Closing issued by a Cap Provider meeting the
rating requirements for a Cap Provider under Section 2.3(A)(v), providing for a
cap "strike price" not greater than the Cap Threshold Rate (a replacement Cap
meeting all of the foregoing conditions, an "ACCEPTABLE REPLACEMENT CAP") within
twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of notice from Lender or Servicer of
such downgrade of the Cap Provider, together with an assignment of such Cap
substantially in the form of the Assignment of Rate Cap and such Financing
Statements and opinions of in-house or

                                       27
<PAGE>

outside counsel to the Cap Provider as Lender may reasonably require each in
form and substance acceptable to Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the
contrary, under no circumstances shall the Cap be terminated by the Borrowers
prior to delivery of an Acceptable Replacement Cap, together with the required
documentation with respect thereto, to Lender. If, for any reason, the Borrowers
are unable to deliver a replacement Cap when required hereunder, then at or
prior to the time when the replacement Cap is due hereunder, the Borrowers shall
deliver to Lender cash security (such cash security together with any interest
thereon, the "CAP RESERVE") in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of
additional interest which Lender reasonably estimates may be incurred during the
remaining term of the Loan (or remaining Extension Term then in effect) as a
result of the LIBO Rate exceeding the Cap Threshold Rate, which Cap Reserve
shall be held by Lender and applied to the Obligations in accordance with
Section 6.1. Upon delivery of an Acceptable Replacement Cap reasonably
acceptable to Lender, the remaining balance of the Cap Reserve shall be promptly
returned to the Borrowers.

      (C)   All payments made by the Cap Provider under the Cap shall be
deposited directly by the Cap Provider into the Lock Box Account and applied in
accordance with the Cash Management Agreement.

SECTION 2.4 PAYMENTS.

      (A)   PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. The Borrowers shall make
payments of interest and principal on the Note as follows:

            (i)   The Borrowers shall make a payment to Lender of interest only
on the Closing Date for the first Interest Accrual Period; and

            (ii)  On each Payment Date commencing with the Payment Date in July
2004 and on each Payment Date thereafter through but not including the Maturity
Date, the Borrowers shall make a payment of interest on the Loan for the
Interest Accrual Period corresponding to such Payment Date, and in addition
shall make a payment of principal on the Loan in an amount equal to the
Scheduled Mortgage Principal Payment for such Payment Date.

      (B)   DATE AND TIME OF PAYMENT. The Borrowers shall receive credit for
payments on the Loan which are transferred to the account of Lender as provided
below (i) on the day that such funds are received by Lender if such receipt
occurs by 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, or (ii) on the next succeeding
Business Day after such funds are received by Lender if such receipt occurs
after 2:00 p.m. (New York time). Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall
be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment may be made
on the next succeeding Business Day.

      (C)   MANNER OF PAYMENT; APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. The Borrowers promise to
pay all of the Obligations relating to the Loan as such amounts become due or
are declared due pursuant to the terms of this Loan Agreement. All payments by
the Borrowers on the Loan shall be made without deduction, defense, set off or
counterclaim and in immediately available funds delivered to Lender by wire
transfer to such accounts at such banks as Lender may from time to time
designate. Prior to an Event of Default, each payment and prepayment hereunder
shall be applied first to pay late charges and the charges and expenses of
Lender, Servicer and any special

                                       28
<PAGE>

servicer as provided hereunder, second to accrued and unpaid interest, and the
balance to principal. Prior to an Event of Default, to the extent sufficient
funds are contained in the Lock Box Account, or an Account or Sub-Account
thereof, to make the required monthly payments to the applicable Reserves and
Sub-Account on such Payment Date, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
satisfied their obligations to make such payments. Provided no Event of Default
has occurred and is then continuing, all principal payments on the Loan shall be
applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Components pro rata. Any
amounts received by Lender during the continuance of an Event of Default may be
applied by Lender toward the payment of interest and/or principal on any of the
Components and/or any other amounts due under the Loan Documents in such order,
priority and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall determine.

SECTION 2.5 MATURITY.

      (A)   SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE. To the extent not sooner due and payable in
accordance with the Loan Documents (and unless the Borrowers shall extend the
term of the Loan for the First Extension Term, the Second Extension Term, or the
Third Extension Term upon the terms and subject to the conditions of Section
2.5(B) below), the then outstanding principal balance of the Loan, all accrued
and unpaid interest thereon (and including interest through the end of the

be due and payable on (i) the Scheduled Maturity Date or (ii) if the Borrowers

the last day of the Second Extension Term and ending (unless sooner terminated

                  Extension Term at any time not later than forty-five (45) days

                  applicable Extension Term;

            (iii) The Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the trailing twelve (12)
                  month period ended (x) on the last day of the immediately
                  preceding calendar quarter prior to the expiration of the
                  First Extension Term is at least 1.30:1.0, with respect to the
                  Second Extension Term, and (y) on the last day immediately

                  than 13%; provided however, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio
                  and/or the Debt Yield fail to satisfy such requirements, the
                  Borrowers shall be entitled to make a principal prepayment of
                  a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (to
                  be applied in accordance with the terms of the Cash Management
                  Agreement) on the then current Maturity Date in an amount, as

                  Service Coverage Ratio and/or the Debt Yield, as applicable,
                  to satisfy such requirements based upon a recalculation
                  thereof assuming that the prepayment amount were applied to
                  reduce the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (on a
                  pro-rata basis between the Loan and the Mezzanine Loan) as of

                  or a replacement Cap in form substantially the same as the Cap
                  delivered at Closing covering the term of the applicable
                  Extension Term, providing for a cap "strike price" (such

                  (including, without limitation, reasonable
                  attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Lender (and by
                  any Servicer and trustee in connection with any Securitization
                  backed in whole or in part by the Loan) in connection with
                  delivery of such extension or replacement Cap and all related
                  documentation and opinions required above.

SECTION 2.6 PREPAYMENT.

      (A)   LIMITATION ON PREPAYMENT; PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION DUE ON
ACCELERATION. The Borrowers may prepay the Loan in whole, or, to the extent
expressly provided herein, in part (in amounts of at least $1,000,000), at any
time, provided that (i) the Borrowers shall provide to Lender not less than
fifteen (15) days prior written notice of such prepayment, (ii) together with
such prepayment the Borrowers also shall pay all accrued and unpaid interest and
all other Obligations then due and owing, (iii) if such prepayment occurs on any
day other than a Payment Date, then together therewith the Borrowers also shall
pay to Lender the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount being
prepaid from and including the date of such prepayment to the end of such
Interest Accrual Period, and (iv) the Borrowers shall pay the applicable
Prepayment Consideration.

      (B)   PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION DUE. If any prepayment of all or any
portion of the Loan shall occur on account of acceleration of the Loan (whether
or not due to an Event of Default), or otherwise, then except only as expressly
provided in this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, the
Borrowers shall pay the Prepayment Consideration on the amount prepaid to Lender
together with such prepayment, as liquidated damages and compensation for costs
incurred, and in addition to all other amounts due and owing to Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Prepayment Consideration will be due as to a
prepayment of the Loan in connection with (i) application of insurance or
condemnation proceeds required by Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement or the
Mortgages in the absence of an Event of Default, (ii) Scheduled Mortgage
Principal Payments, (iii) in connection with prepayments made in connection with
any Release of a Sales Property (it being agreed that the Prepayment
Consideration will be due with respect to all other Releases (other than
Releases effectuated pursuant to Section 5.5(E)), or (iv) upon prepayment of the
Loan in full or in part during any Extension Term (provided the amount of
interest that would have accrued on the amount being prepaid from and including
the date of such prepayment through the end of the current Interest Accrual
Period shall be payable with such prepayment). The foregoing designation of any
amount of Prepayment Consideration in this Agreement shall not create a right to
prepay at any time or in any circumstances where this Agreement does not
expressly state that such a right exists.

SECTION 2.7 OUTSTANDING BALANCE. The balance on Lender's books and records shall
be presumptive evidence (absent manifest error) of the amounts owing to Lender
by the Borrowers; provided that any failure to record any transaction affecting
such balance or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect
the Borrowers' obligation to pay the Obligations.

SECTION 2.8 TAXES. Any and all payments or reimbursements made hereunder or
under the Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and
all taxes, withholding taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto

                                       31
<PAGE>

arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents (all such taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings
and all liabilities with respect thereto (excluding taxes imposed on net income
in accordance with the following sentence) herein "TAX LIABILITIES").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers shall not be liable for taxes
imposed on the net income of Lender by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
Lender is organized or doing business or any political subdivision thereof and
taxes imposed on its net income by the jurisdiction of Lender's applicable
lending office or any political subdivision thereof. If the Borrowers shall be
required by law to deduct any such Tax Liabilities (or amounts in estimation or
reimbursement for the same) from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to
Lender, then the sum payable hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so
that, after making all required deductions, Lender receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.

SECTION 2.9 REASONABLENESS OF CHARGES. The Borrower Parties agree that (i) the
actual costs and damages that Lender would suffer by reason of an Event of
Default (exclusive of the attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in connection
with enforcement of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents) or a prepayment
would be difficult and needlessly expensive to calculate and establish, and (ii)
the amounts of the Default Rate, the late charges, and the Prepayment
Consideration are reasonable, taking into consideration the circumstances known
to the parties at this time, and (iii) such Default Rate and late charges and
Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with enforcement of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents shall be
due and payable as provided herein, and (iv) such interest at the Default Rate,
late charges, Prepayment Consideration, and the obligation to pay Lender's
reasonable attorneys' fees and other enforcement costs do not, individually or
collectively, constitute a penalty.

SECTION 2.10  FUNDING LOSSES/CHANGE IN LAW ETC.

      (A)   The Borrowers hereby agree to pay to Lender any amount necessary to
compensate Lender and any Funding Party for any losses or costs (including,
without limitation, the costs of breaking any "LIBOR" contract, if applicable,
or funding losses determined on the basis of Lender's or such Funding Party's
reinvestment rate and the interest rate on the Loan) (collectively, "FUNDING
LOSSES") sustained by Lender or any Funding Party: (i) if the Note, or any
portion thereof, is repaid for any reason whatsoever on any date other than a
Payment Date (including, without limitation, from condemnation or insurance
proceeds); or (ii) as a consequence of (x) any increased cost of funds that
Lender or any Funding Party may sustain in maintaining the borrowing evidenced
hereby or (y) the reduction of any amounts received or receivable from the
Borrowers, in either case, due to the introduction of, or any change in, law or
applicable regulation or treaty adopted after the date hereof (including the
administration or interpretation thereof), whether or not having the force of
law, or due to the compliance by Lender or the Funding Party, as the case may
be, with any directive, whether or not having the force of law, or request from
any central bank or domestic or foreign governmental authority, agency or
instrumentality having jurisdiction made as of the date hereof, to the extent
Lender reasonably determines that such Funding Losses are allocable to the Loan.

      (B)   If Lender or any Funding Party shall have determined that the
applicability of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted pursuant to or
arising out of the July 1988 report of the

                                       32
<PAGE>

Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the
adoption of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline (including but not
limited to any United States law, rule, regulation or guideline) regarding
capital adequacy, or any change becoming effective in any of the foregoing or in
the enforcement or interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by
any court or any domestic or foreign governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the enforcement or interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by Lender or its holding company or a
Funding Party or its holding company, as the case may be, with any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency made after the date
hereof, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of Lender or its holding company, or of the Funding Party's or its
holding company, as the case may be, then, upon demand by Lender, the Borrowers
shall pay to Lender, from time to time, such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate Lender or such Funding Party for any such reduction suffered.

      (C)   Any amount payable by the Borrowers under Section 2.10(A) or 2.10(B)
shall be paid to Lender within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by the
Borrowers of a certificate signed by an officer of Lender setting forth the
amount due and the basis for the determination of such amount in reasonable
detail and the computations made by Lender to determine the amount due, which
statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers, absent manifest
error. Failure on the part of Lender to demand payment from the Borrowers for
any such amount attributable to any particular period shall not constitute a
waiver of Lender's right to demand payment of such amount for any subsequent or
prior period. Lender shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to the Borrowers
prompt notice of any event described in Sections 2.10(A) or 2.10(B) above and of
the amount to be paid as a result thereof, provided, however, any failure by
Lender to so notify the Borrowers shall not affect the Borrowers' obligation to
make the payments to be made under this Section as a result thereof. All amounts
which may become due and payable by the Borrowers in accordance with the
provisions of this Section shall constitute additional interest under the Loan
and shall be secured by the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents.

      (D)   If Lender or any Funding Party requests compensation for any losses
or costs to be reimbursed pursuant to any one or more of the provisions of
clause (ii) of Sections 2.10(A) or 2.10(B), then, upon request of the Borrowers,
Lender or such Funding Party shall use reasonable efforts in a manner consistent
with such institution's practice in connection with loans like the Loan to
eliminate, mitigate or reduce amounts that would otherwise be payable by the
Borrowers under the foregoing provisions, provided that such action would not be
otherwise prejudicial to Lender or such Funding Party, including, without
limitation, by designating another of Lender's or such Funding Party's offices,
branches or affiliates; the Borrowers hereby agreeing to pay all reasonably
incurred costs and expenses incurred by Lender or any Funding Party in
connection with any such action.

SECTION 2.11 SERVICING/SPECIAL SERVICING. Lender may change the Servicer from
time to time without the consent of the Borrowers, on prior written notice to
the Borrowers. The Borrowers expressly acknowledge and agree that the Servicer's
fees (the "SERVICING FEE"), which shall in no event exceed five one-hundredths
of one percent (.05%) per annum on the outstanding principal balance of the
Loan, payable in monthly installments, and if the Loan becomes a specially
serviced loan, any fees of the special servicer, shall be payable by the
Borrowers and

                                       33
<PAGE>

shall constitute a portion of the Obligations; provided, however, that at no
time shall the Borrowers be liable for Servicing Fees or special servicing fees
in excess of those fees charged to Lender by the Servicer or any special
servicer.

      (B)   NO CONFLICT. The execution, delivery and performance by each
Borrower Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not: (1) violate (x)
any provision of law applicable to any Borrower Party; (y) the partnership
agreement, certificate of limited partnership, certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, declaration of trust, operating agreement or other organizational
documents, as the case may be, of each Borrower Party; or (z) any order,
judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority binding on any Borrower Party
or any of its Affiliates; (2) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute
(with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any Contractual
Obligation of any Borrower Party or any of its Affiliates (except where such
breach will not cause a Material Adverse Effect); (3) result in or require the
creation or imposition of any material Lien (other than the Lien of the Loan
Documents) upon the Properties or assets of any Borrower Party; or (4) except as
set forth on SCHEDULE 4.2, require any approval or consent of any Person under
any material Contractual Obligation of any Borrower Party, which approvals or
consents have been obtained on or before the dates required under such material
Contractual Obligation, but in no event later than the Closing Date.

      (C)   GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. The execution and delivery by each Borrower
Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not require any registration
with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any
Governmental Authority.

      (D)   BINDING OBLIGATIONS. This Loan Agreement is, and the Loan Documents,
including the Note, when executed and delivered will be, the legally valid and
binding obligations of each Borrower Party that is a party thereto, enforceable
against each of the Borrower Parties, as applicable, in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
and other similar laws affecting creditor's rights. No Borrower Party has any
defense or offset to any of its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it
is a party. No Borrower Party has any claim against Lender or any Affiliate of
Lender.

SECTION 4.3 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. All financial statements concerning any of the
Borrowers, their Affiliates and the Properties which have been furnished by or
on behalf of the Borrowers to Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement present
fairly the financial condition of the Persons covered thereby as of the dates
thereof and the results of their operations for the periods then ended, and, to
the Borrowers' Knowledge after due inquiry, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied (except as disclosed therein). Since the date of
the financial statements delivered to Lender, there has been no material adverse
change in the financial condition, operations or business of the Borrower
Parties or the Properties from that set forth in said financial statements.

SECTION 4.4 INDEBTEDNESS AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. As of the Closing, the
Borrowers shall have no outstanding Indebtedness or Contingent Obligations other
than the Obligations or any other Permitted Indebtedness.

SECTION 4.5 TITLE TO THE PROPERTIES. The Borrowers have good and marketable fee
simple title (or, in the case of the Ground Leased Properties, leasehold title)
to the Properties, free and clear of all Liens except for the Permitted
Encumbrances. The Borrowers own and will own at all times all FF&E relating to
the Properties (other than personal property which is either owned by tenants of
such Property, not used or necessary for the operation of the applicable
Property, or leased by the Borrowers as permitted hereunder), subject only to
the Permitted Encumbrances. The Mortgages, when properly recorded in the
appropriate records, together with any Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements required to be filed in connection therewith, will create (i) a
valid, perfected first lien on each of the Properties, subject only to the
Permitted Encumbrances, and (ii) perfected first priority security interests in
and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all personalty (including the
Rents, the Leases, and the FF&E ), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in
each case subject only to any applicable Permitted Encumbrances. Lender will
have a perfected first priority security interest in and to the FF&E owned by
the Borrowers, if any, not located at the Properties. To the Borrowers'
Knowledge, except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.5, there are no proceedings in
condemnation or eminent domain affecting any of the Properties, and to the
actual Knowledge of the Borrowers, none is threatened. Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.5(A), no Person has any option or other right to purchase all or any
portion of any of the Properties or any interest therein. To the Borrowers'
Knowledge, there are no mechanic's, materialman's or other similar liens or
claims which have been filed for work, labor or materials affecting the
Properties which are or will be liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with, the
lien of any of the Mortgages. None of the Permitted Encumbrances, individually
or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the benefits of the security
intended to be provided by the Mortgages and this Loan Agreement, materially and
adversely affect the value of any of the Properties, impair the use or
operations of the Properties or impair the Borrowers' ability to pay its
obligations in a timely manner.

SECTION 4.6 ZONING; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. To the Borrower's Knowledge, except as
set forth in the Zoning Reports for the Properties delivered to Lender, the
Properties and the use thereof comply in all material respects with all
applicable zoning, subdivision and land use laws, regulations and ordinances,
all applicable health, fire, building codes, parking laws and all other laws,
statutes, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to the Properties,
or any of them, including without limitation the Americans with Disabilities
Act. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, there are no illegal activities relating to
controlled substances on any of the Properties. To the Borrower's Knowledge,
except as set forth in the Zoning Reports for the Properties delivered to
Lender, all material permits, licenses and certificates for the lawful use,
occupancy and operation of each component of each of the Properties in the
manner in which it is currently being used, occupied and operated, including,
but not limited to liquor licenses and certificates of occupancy, or the
equivalent, have been obtained and are current and in full force and effect. To
the Borrower's Knowledge, except as set forth in the Zoning Reports for the
Properties delivered to Lender, in the event that all or any part of the
Improvements located on any Property is destroyed or damaged, said Improvements
can be legally reconstructed to their condition prior to such damage or
destruction, and thereafter exist for the same use without violating any zoning
or other ordinances applicable thereto and without the necessity of

                                       41
<PAGE>

obtaining any variances or special permits, other than customary demolition,
building and other construction related permits. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, no
legal proceedings are pending or threatened with respect to the zoning of any
Property. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, except as set forth in the Title Policies
and/or the Surveys, neither the zoning nor any other right to construct, use or
operate any Property is in any way dependent upon or related to any real estate
other than such Property. No tract map, parcel map, condominium plan,
condominium declaration, or plat of subdivision will be recorded by the
Borrowers with respect to any Property without Lender's prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

SECTION 4.7 LEASES; AGREEMENTS.

      (A)   LEASES; AGREEMENTS. The Borrowers have delivered to Lender true and
complete copies (in all material respects) of all (i) Leases for more than five
hundred (500) square feet of space at any Property and (ii) Material Agreements
affecting the operation and management of the Properties, and such Leases and
Material Agreements have not been modified or amended except pursuant to
amendments or modifications delivered to Lender. Except for the rights of each
of the current Managers pursuant to the existing Management Agreements, no
Person has any right or obligation to manage any of the Properties or to receive
compensation in connection with such management. Except for the parties to any
leasing brokerage agreement that has been delivered to Lender, no Person has any
right or obligation to lease or solicit tenants for the Properties, or (except
for cooperating outside brokers) to receive compensation in connection with such
leasing.

      (B)   RENT ROLL, DISCLOSURE. A true and correct copy of the Rent Roll is
attached hereto as SCHEDULE 4.7(B) and, except for the Material Leases described
in the Rent Roll, none of the Properties are subject to any Material Leases.
Except only as specified in the Rent Roll, or as otherwise disclosed to Lender
in the estoppel certificates delivered to Lender at Closing, to the Borrowers'
Knowledge, (i) the Material Leases are in full force and effect; (ii) the
Borrowers have not given any notice of default to any tenant under any Material
Lease which remains uncured; (iii) no tenant has any set off, claim or defense
to the enforcement of any Material Lease; (iv) no tenant is in arrears in the
payment of rent, additional rent or any other charges whatsoever due under any
Material Lease, or is materially in default in the performance of any other
obligations under such Material Lease; (v) the Borrowers have completed all work
or alterations required of the landlord or lessor under each Material Lease, and
all of the other obligations of landlord or lessor under the Material Leases
have been performed; and (vi) there are no rent concessions (whether in form of
cash contributions, work agreements, assumption of an existing tenant's other
obligations, or otherwise) or extensions of time whatsoever not reflected in
such Rent Roll. There are no legal proceedings commenced (or, to the Knowledge
of the Borrowers, threatened) against the Borrowers by any tenant or former
tenant. No rental in excess of one month's rent has been prepaid under any of
the Material Leases. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, each of the Material Leases is
valid and binding on the parties thereto in accordance with its terms.

      (C)   NO RESIDENTIAL UNITS. There are no residential units in any of the
Properties and, to each Borrower's Knowledge, no person (other than a site
manager employed by Manager) occupies any part of the Properties for dwelling
purposes other than on a transient basis.

                                       42
<PAGE>

      (D)   MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. The Borrowers have delivered to Lender a true
and complete copy of each of the Management Agreements to which they are a party
that will be in effect on the Closing Date, and such Management Agreements have
not been modified or amended except pursuant to amendments or modifications
delivered to Lender. The Management Agreements are in full force and effect and
no default by any of the Borrowers or Manager exists thereunder.

      (E)   FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS; PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT PLANS. The Borrowers have
delivered to Lender a true and complete copy of each of the Franchise Agreements
to which they are a party, and such Franchise Agreements have not been modified
or amended except pursuant to amendments or modifications delivered to Lender.
To the Borrowers' Knowledge, (i) the applicable Franchise Agreements are in full
force and effect and (ii) except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.7(E), no material
default by the Borrowers, Manager or the applicable Franchisor exists
thereunder. The defaults listed on SCHEDULE 4.7(E), individually and in the
aggregate, do not and will not have a Material Adverse Effect. Except for the
Property Improvement Plans set forth on EXHIBIT G attached hereto, there are no
other property improvement plans or similar capital improvement plans or
obligations required by any Franchisor pursuant to any Franchise Agreement, in
effect for any of the Properties.

SECTION 4.8 CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES. To each Borrower's Knowledge, except as
set forth in the Property Condition Reports for the Properties delivered to
Lender, all Improvements including, without limitation, the roof and all
structural components, plumbing systems, HVAC systems, fire protection systems,
electrical systems, equipment, elevators, exterior doors, parking facilities,
sidewalks and landscaping are in good condition and repair. Except as disclosed
in the Property Condition Reports, (i) the Borrowers are not aware of any latent
or patent structural or other material defect or deficiency in the Properties
and, (ii) to the Borrowers' Knowledge, city water supply, storm and sanitary
sewers, and electrical, gas (if applicable) and telephone facilities are
available to each of the Properties within the boundary lines of each of the
Properties (except as may be shown on the applicable Survey), are fully
connected to the Improvements and are fully operational, are sufficient to meet
the reasonable needs of each of the Properties as now used or presently
contemplated to be used, and no other utility facilities are necessary to meet
the reasonable needs of each of the Properties as now used or presently
contemplated. Except as may be shown on the applicable Survey, to the Borrowers'
Knowledge no part of any of the Properties is within a flood plain and none of
the Improvements create encroachments over, across or upon the Properties'
boundary lines, rights of way or easements, and no building or other
improvements on adjoining land create such an encroachment which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All public roads and
streets necessary for service of and access to each of the Properties for the
current and contemplated uses thereof have been completed and are serviceable
and are physically and legally open for use by the public. To the Borrowers'
Knowledge after due inquiry, and except as disclosed in the Property Condition
Reports, any septic system located at any of the Properties is in good and safe
condition and repair and in compliance with all applicable law.

SECTION 4.9 LITIGATION; ADVERSE FACTS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9,
there are no judgments outstanding against any Borrower Party, or affecting any
of the Properties or any property of any Borrower, nor is there any action,
charge, claim, demand, suit, proceeding, petition, governmental investigation or
arbitration now pending or, to the Borrowers'

                                       43
<PAGE>

Knowledge, threatened against any Borrower Party that could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the Borrowers' Knowledge
after due inquiry, the actions, charges, claims, demand, suits, proceedings,
petitions, investigations and arbitrations set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9 are not
reasonably expected to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in any
Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.10 PAYMENT OF TAXES. All federal, state and local tax returns and
reports of each Primary Borrower Party required to be filed have been timely
filed (or each Borrower has timely filed for an extension and the applicable
extension has not expired), and all taxes, assessments, fees and other
governmental charges (including any payments in lieu of taxes) upon such Person
and upon its properties, assets, income and franchises which are due and payable
have been paid. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, there is not presently pending any
special assessment against any of the Properties or any part thereof.

SECTION 4.11 ADVERSE CONTRACTS. Except for the Loan Documents, none of the
Primary Borrower Parties is a party to or bound by, nor is any property of such
Person subject to or bound by, any contract or other agreement which restricts
such Person's ability to conduct its business in the ordinary course as
currently conducted that, either individually or in the aggregate, has a
Material Adverse Effect or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.12 PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS. No Borrower Party is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation of any such Person which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and no condition
exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.13 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. No Primary Borrower Party is subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or to any federal or state
statute or regulation limiting its ability to incur indebtedness for borrowed
money.

SECTION 4.14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.14, no
Primary Borrower Party maintains or contributes to, or has any obligation
(including a contingent obligation) under, any Employee Benefit Plans.

SECTION 4.15 BROKER'S FEES. No broker's or finder's fee, commission or similar
compensation will be payable by or pursuant to any contract or other obligation
of any Primary Borrower Party with respect to the making of the Loan or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby or by any of the Loan Documents. The
Borrowers shall indemnify, defend, protect, pay and hold Lender harmless from
any and all broker's or finder's fees claimed to be due in connection with the
making of the Loan arising from any Borrower Parties' actions.

SECTION 4.16 INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

SECTION 4.17 SOLVENCY. The Borrowers (a) have not entered into the transaction
or any Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any
creditor and (b) received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its
obligations under the Loan Documents. Giving

                                       44
<PAGE>

effect to the Loan, the aggregate fair saleable value of the Borrowers' assets
exceed and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed the
Borrowers' total liabilities, including, without limitation, subordinated,
unliquidated, disputed and Contingent Obligations. The aggregate fair saleable
value of the Borrowers' assets is and will, immediately following the making of
the Loan, be greater than the Borrowers' probable total liabilities, including
the maximum amount of their Contingent Obligations on their debts as such debts
become absolute and matured. Each Borrower's assets do not and, immediately
following the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital
to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. The
Borrowers do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur
Indebtedness and liabilities (including Contingent Obligations and other
commitments) beyond their ability to pay such Indebtedness and liabilities as
they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received
by the Borrowers and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations
of the Borrowers).

SECTION 4.18 DISCLOSURE. No financial statements furnished to Lender by or on
behalf of any Borrower Party contains any untrue representation, warranty or
statement of a material fact, or omits to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein not misleading. No Loan Document
or any other document, certificate or written statement for use in connection
with the Loan and prepared by any Borrower Party, or any information provided by
any Borrower Party and contained in, or used in preparation of, any document or
certificate for use in connection with the Loan, contains any untrue
representation, warranty or statement of a material fact, or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading. There is no material fact actually known to the Borrowers that has
had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and that
has not been disclosed in writing to Lender by the Borrowers.

SECTION 4.19 USE OF PROCEEDS AND MARGIN SECURITY. The Borrowers shall use the
proceeds of the Loan only for the purposes set forth herein and consistent with
all applicable laws, statutes, rules and regulations. No portion of the proceeds
of the Loan shall be used by the Borrowers or any Person in any manner that
might cause the borrowing or the application of such proceeds to violate
Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X or any other regulation of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

SECTION 4.20 INSURANCE. Set forth on SCHEDULE 4.20 is a complete and accurate
description of all policies of insurance for each Borrower that are in effect as

such policies, and, to each Borrower's Knowledge, the Borrowers are in
compliance with all conditions contained in such policies.

SECTION 4.21 SEPARATE TAX LOTS. Each of the Properties are comprised of one (1)
or more parcels which constitute separate tax lots. No part of any of the
Properties is included or assessed under or as part of another tax lot or
parcel, and no part of any other property is included or assessed under or as
part of the tax lots or parcels comprising any of the Properties.

SECTION 4.22 INVESTMENTS. The Borrowers have no (i) direct or indirect interest
in, including without limitation stock, partnership interest or other securities
of, any other Person (other than Beverage Companies), or (ii) direct or indirect
loan, advance or capital contribution to any other Person, including all
indebtedness and accounts receivable from that other Person.

SECTION 4.23 BANKRUPTCY. No Borrower Party is a debtor, and no property of any
of them (including any Property) is property of the estate, in any voluntary or
involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect. No
Borrower Party and no property of any of them is under the possession or control
of a receiver, trustee or other custodian. No Borrower Party has made any
assignment for the benefit of creditors. No such assignment or bankruptcy or
similar case or proceeding is now contemplated.

SECTION 4.24 DEFAULTS. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, except as disclosed to
Lender in writing herein or in any of the Loan Documents, no Default exists.

SECTION 4.25 NO PLAN ASSETS. No Primary Borrower Party is or will be (i) an
employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA which is subject to
ERISA, (ii) a plan as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the IRC which is subject
to Section 4975 of the IRC, or (iii) an entity whose underlying assets
constitute "plan assets" of any such employee benefit plan or plan for purposes
of Title I of ERISA of Section 4975 of the IRC; provided that, in making such
representation, the Borrowers have assumed that (i) no portion of the Loan shall
be funded with plan assets of any employee benefit plan that is subject to Title
I of ERISA or any plan that is covered by Section 4975 of the Code unless the
Lender is eligible to apply one or more exemptions such that the Loan will not
constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or that
could subject a Borrower Party or its Affiliates to an excise tax under Section
4975 of the IRC; and (ii) such assumption in the preceding clause is true and
correct with respect to any party to which Lender transfers or assigns any
portion of the Loan.

SECTION 4.26 GOVERNMENTAL PLAN. No Primary Borrower Party is or will be a
"governmental plan" within the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA and
transactions by or with the Borrowers are not and will not be subject to state
statutes applicable to the Borrowers' regulating investments of and fiduciary
obligations with obligations with respect to governmental plans.

SECTION 4.27 NOT FOREIGN PERSON. No Primary Borrower Party is a "foreign person"
within the meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) of the IRC.

SECTION 4.28 NO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.28, no Primary Borrower Party is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement.

SECTION 4.29 CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY DOCUMENTS.

      (A)   The Borrowers have delivered true and correct copies of each of the
Condominium Property Documents to Lender and same have not been modified,
amended or assigned except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.29, and to the Borrowers'
Knowledge, there are no other material documents or agreements affecting the
Condominium Borrower's interest in the Condominium Property.

      (B)   Each of the Condominium Property Documents is in full force and
effect and, to the Condominium Borrower's Knowledge, no breach or default, or
event that, with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would
constitute a breach or default, under any of the Condominium Property Documents
(a "CONDOMINIUM DEFAULT") exists or has occurred on the

                                       46
<PAGE>

part of the Condominium Borrower or on the part of any other party to any of the
Condominium Property Documents. The Condominium Borrower has not received any
written notice that a default under the Condominium Property Documents has
occurred or exists, or that the Board of Managers or any third party alleges the
same to have occurred or exist.

SECTION 4.30 GROUND LEASES

      (A)   Each Ground Lease contains the entire agreement of the Ground Lessor
and the applicable Borrower pertaining to each Ground Leased Property covered
thereby. The Borrowers have no estate, right, title or interest in or to the
Ground Leased Properties except under and pursuant to the Ground Leases. The
Borrowers have delivered true and correct copies of each of the Ground Leases to
Lender and the Ground Leases have not been modified, amended or assigned except

      (B)   To the Knowledge of the Borrowers, each Ground Lessor is the
exclusive fee simple owner of its Ground Leased Property, subject only to the
Ground Lease and the Permitted Encumbrances, and each Ground Lessor is the sole
owner of the lessor's interest in the applicable Ground Lease.

      (C)   There are no rights to terminate any Ground Lease other than any
Ground Lessor's right to terminate by reason of default, casualty, condemnation
or other reasons, in each case as expressly set forth in the applicable Ground
Lease.

      (D)   Each Ground Lease is in full force and effect and to the Borrowers'
Knowledge, no breach or default or event that with the giving of notice or
passage of time would constitute a breach or default under any Ground Lease (a
"GROUND LEASE DEFAULT") exists or has occurred on the part of the Borrowers or
on the part of any Ground Lessor under any Ground Lease. All base rent and
additional rent due and payable under the Ground Leases has been paid through
the date hereof and the Borrowers are not required to pay any deferred or
accrued rent after the date hereof under any of the Ground Leases. The Borrowers
have not received any written notice that a Ground Lease Default has occurred or

completed during such calendar month (including a detailed explanation for any
material deviations from budget) and setting forth that all disbursements and/or

opposed to items that, in accordance with GAAP, would be included as an
Operating Expense); (e) monthly and year to date detailed reports of Operating
Expenses for each of the Properties, including supporting documentation
satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion for each item of Extraordinary
Expense (as such term is defined in the Cash Management Agreement) for which

Borrowers are diligently continuing to pursue reflagging efforts with respect to
each such Property, and (iv) a summary report including (a) the aggregate number

the applicable Franchise Agreements has occurred pursuant to the terms of
Sections 5.13(D)(ii) and 5.13(D)(iii) together with the percentage of the
Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance represented by such Properties and

                                       49
<PAGE>

email in Microsoft Excel format or other spreadsheet format reasonably
acceptable to Lender (in the case of any statements, reports or information
provided by third parties that are not Affiliates of the Borrowers, to the
extent same are available in such format). Along with such operating statements,
each Borrower shall deliver to Lender a Compliance Certificate of such
Borrower's chief executive officer or chief financial officer (or other officer
with similar duties) satisfying the criteria set forth in Section 5.1(A)(viii)
below.

            (vi)  ADDITIONAL REPORTING. In addition to the foregoing, the
Borrowers shall, and shall cause Guarantor and Manager to, promptly provide to
Lender such further documents and information concerning its operations,
properties, ownership, and finances as Lender shall from time to time reasonably
request upon prior written notice to the Borrowers.

            (vii) GAAP; UNIFORM SYSTEM. The Borrowers will, and will cause
Guarantor and Manager to, maintain systems of accounting established and
administered in accordance with sound business practices and sufficient in all
respects to permit preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP
and the Uniform System. All Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP and the Uniform System, consistently applied; provided, however, in
the event of a conflict between the Uniform System and GAAP, GAAP will be
followed.

            (viii) CERTIFICATIONS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS,
COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE. Together with the Financial Statements and other
documents and information provided to Lender by or on behalf of the Borrowers or
Guarantor under this Section, the Borrowers or Guarantor also shall deliver to
Lender a certification to Lender, executed on behalf of the Borrowers or
Guarantor by their respective chief executive officer or chief financial officer
(or other officer with similar duties), stating that to their Knowledge after
due inquiry such quarterly and annual Financial Statements and information
fairly present the financial condition and results of operations of the
Borrowers, Guarantor and/or the Properties for the period(s) covered thereby,
and do not omit to state any material information without which the same might
reasonably be misleading, and all other non-financial documents submitted to
Lender (whether monthly, quarterly or annually) are true, correct, accurate and
complete in all material respects. In addition, where this Loan Agreement
requires a "COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE", the Person required to submit the same
shall deliver a certificate duly executed on behalf of such Person by its chief
executive officer or chief financial officer (or other officer with similar
duties) stating (a) that, to their Knowledge after due inquiry, there does not
exist any Default or Event of Default under the Loan Documents (or if any
exists, specifying the same in detail), and (b) the Borrowers and Guarantor have
complied with the applicable reporting requirements of this Section 5.1.

            (ix)  FISCAL YEAR. Each Borrower represents that its fiscal year and
that of the Guarantor ends on December 31, and agrees that no change shall be
made to each such fiscal year, without Lender's prior written consent.

      (B)   ACCOUNTANTS' REPORTS. Promptly upon receipt thereof, each Borrower
will deliver copies of all material reports submitted by independent public
accountants in connection with each annual, interim or special audit of the
Financial Statements or other business

                                       50
<PAGE>

operations of such Borrower made by such accountants, including the comment
letter submitted by such accountants to management in connection with the annual
audit.

      (C)   TAX RETURNS. Within thirty (30) days after filing the same, each
Borrower shall deliver to Lender a copy of its Federal income tax returns (or
the return of the applicable Person into which such Borrower's Federal income
tax return is consolidated) certified on its behalf by its chief financial
officer (or similar position) to be true and correct.

      (D)   ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET, CAPEX/FF&E BUDGETS. Prior to February 15 of
each calendar year, each Borrower shall deliver to Lender for its review for its
Property a proposed Operating Budget and CapEx/FF&E Budget (in each case
presented on a monthly and annual basis) for such calendar year. Each Operating
Budget and CapEx/FF&E Budget shall be subject to Lender's approval which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Provided that no Cash Trap
Event or Event of Default exists, the Borrowers may make changes to the
Operating Budget and the CapEx/FF&E Budget from time to time as deemed
reasonably necessary by the Borrower, provided no such modification (together
with all prior modifications taken as a whole) shall alter any single line item
(or the applicable Budget as a whole) by more than ten percent (10%) without
Lender's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, during a Cash Trap
Event, increases to the Operating Budget for any Property (not to exceed ten
percent (10%) of the Operating Budget for such Property as a whole) will be
permitted without Lender's consent for actual verifiable increases in utilities,
water and sewer assessments and charges and real property taxes for the
applicable Property over the amounts therefor set forth in the Operating Budget
for the prior period. Notice of any modifications to the Operating Budget and
the CapEx/FF&E Budget shall be delivered to Lender at the time of delivery of
the next financial reporting required pursuant to Section 5.1(A)(v). Lender
acknowledges that it has approved the annual Operating Budget and the CapEx/FF&E
Budget for the 2004 calendar year. The proposed Operating Budget shall identify
and set forth each Borrower's reasonable estimate, after due consideration, of
all revenue, costs, and expenses, and shall specify Operating Revenues and
Operating Expenses on a line-item basis consistent with the form of Operating
Budget delivered to Lender prior to Closing. If any of said budgets or plans
requiring Lender's approval is not in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Lender, Lender may disapprove the same and specify the reasons therefor in
writing, and the Borrowers shall promptly amend and resubmit for approval
revised budgets or plans, as applicable, making such changes as are necessary to
comply with the reasonable requirements of Lender. Until any such budget or plan
for any year requiring Lender's approval has been approved or deemed approved,
the applicable budget or plan for the previous year shall remain in effect until
the new budget or plan is approved or deemed approved. Lender's consent to any
budget, plan or amendments thereto shall be deemed given, if the first
correspondence from the Borrowers to Lender requesting such approval is in an
envelope marked "PRIORITY" and contains a bold-faced, conspicuous legend at the
top of the first page thereof stating that "IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR TO
EXPRESSLY DENY THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) DAYS,
YOUR APPROVAL MAY BE DEEMED GIVEN", and is accompanied by the information and
documents required above and any other information reasonably requested by
Lender in writing prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period in
order to adequately review the same has been delivered and, if Lender fails to
respond or to expressly deny such request for approval in writing within the
fifteen (15) day period, a second

                                       51
<PAGE>

notice is delivered to Lender from the Borrowers in an envelope marked
"PRIORITY" requesting approval containing a bold-faced, conspicuous legend at
the top of the first page thereof stating that "IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR
EXPRESSLY DENY THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS, YOUR
APPROVAL SHALL BE DEEMED GIVEN" and Lender fails to respond or to expressly deny
each request for approval within the ten (10) day period.

      (E)   MATERIAL NOTICES.

            (i)   The Borrowers shall promptly deliver, or cause to be
delivered, copies of all notices given or received with respect to a default
under any term or condition related to any Permitted Indebtedness of any
Borrower, and shall notify Lender within five (5) Business Days of any potential
or actual event of default with respect to any such Permitted Indebtedness.

            (ii)  The Borrowers shall promptly deliver to Lender copies of any
and all material notices (including without limitation any notice alleging any
default or breach which is reasonably expected to result in a termination)
received with respect to any Material Agreement or any Lease, including, without
limitation, any inspection report and any progress reports related to any
Property Improvement Plan received from a Franchisor related to such Borrower's
Property.

      (F)   EVENTS OF DEFAULT, ETC. Promptly upon any of the Borrowers obtaining
knowledge of any of the following events or conditions, such Borrower shall
deliver a certificate executed on its behalf by its chief financial officer or
similar officer specifying the nature and period of existence of such condition
or event and what action such Borrower or any Affiliate thereof has taken, is
taking and proposes to take with respect thereto: (i) any condition or event
that constitutes an Event of Default; (ii) any Material Adverse Effect; or (iii)
any actual or alleged breach or default or assertion of (or written threat to
assert) remedies under any Management Agreement, Franchise Agreement or Ground
Lease.

      (G)   LITIGATION. Promptly upon any of the Borrowers obtaining knowledge
of (1) the institution of any action, suit, proceeding, governmental
investigation or arbitration against the Borrowers or any of the Properties not
previously disclosed in writing by the Borrowers to Lender which would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or is not covered by
insurance or (2) any material development in any action, suit, proceeding,
governmental investigation or arbitration at any time pending against or
affecting the Borrowers or the Properties which, in each case, if adversely
determined would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the
Borrowers will give notice thereof to Lender and, upon request from Lender,
provide such other information as may be reasonably available to them to enable
Lender and its counsel to evaluate such matter.

      (H)   INSURANCE. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the end of each
insurance policy period of the Borrowers, the Borrowers will deliver
certificates, reports, and/or other information (all in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Lender), (i) outlining all material insurance
coverage maintained as of the date thereof by the Borrowers and all material
insurance coverage planned to be maintained by the Borrowers in the subsequent
insurance policy period and (ii) evidencing payment in full of the premiums for
such insurance policies.

                                       52
<PAGE>

      (I)   OTHER INFORMATION. With reasonable promptness, Borrowers will
deliver such other information and data with respect to such Person and its
Affiliates or the Properties as from time to time may be reasonably requested by
Lender.

SECTION 5.2 EXISTENCE; QUALIFICATION. The Borrowers will at all times preserve
and keep in full force and effect their existence as a limited partnership,
limited liability company, or corporation, as the case may be, and all rights
and franchises material to its business, including their qualification to do
business in each state where it is required by law to so qualify. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Borrower and, to the extent required by
applicable law, General Partner and Member, shall at all times be qualified to
do business in each of the states where the Properties are located.

SECTION 5.3 PAYMENT OF IMPOSITIONS AND CLAIMS.

      (A)   Except for those matters being contested pursuant to clause (B)
below, the Borrowers will pay (i) all Impositions; (ii) all claims (including
claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) for sums that have become
due and payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon any of its
properties or assets (hereinafter referred to as the "CLAIMS"); and (iii) all
federal, state and local income taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes and all other
taxes and assessments of the Borrowers on their business, income or assets; in
each instance before any penalty or fine is incurred with respect thereto.

      (B)   The Borrowers shall not be required to pay, discharge or remove any
Imposition or Claim relating to a Property so long as the Borrowers contest in
good faith such Imposition, Claim or the validity, applicability or amount
thereof by an appropriate legal proceeding which operates to prevent the
collection of such amounts and the sale of the applicable Property or any
portion thereof, and so long as: (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, (ii) prior to the date on which such Imposition or Claim would
otherwise have become delinquent, the Borrowers shall have given Lender prior
written notice of their intent to contest said Imposition or Claim; (iii) prior
to the date on which such Imposition or Claim would otherwise have become
delinquent, the Borrowers shall have deposited with Lender (or with a court of
competent jurisdiction or other appropriate body reasonably approved by Lender)
such additional amounts as are necessary to keep on deposit at all times, an
amount by way of cash, Dollar Equivalents, or a Letter of Credit, equal to at
least one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) (or such higher amount as may be
required by applicable law) of the total of (x) the balance of such Imposition
or Claim then remaining unpaid, and (y) all interest, penalties, costs and
charges accrued or accumulated thereon; (iv) no risk of sale, forfeiture or loss
of any interest in the applicable Property or any part thereof arises, in
Lender's reasonable judgment, during the pendency of such contest; (v) such
contest does not, in Lender's reasonable determination, have a Material Adverse
Effect; and (vi) such contest is based on bona fide, material, and reasonable
claims or defenses. Any such contest shall be prosecuted with due diligence, and
the Borrowers shall promptly pay the amount of such Imposition or Claim as
finally determined, together with all interest and penalties payable in
connection therewith. Lender shall have full power and authority, but no
obligation, to apply any amount deposited with Lender under this subsection to
the payment of any unpaid Imposition or Claim to prevent the sale or forfeiture
of the applicable Property for non-payment thereof, if Lender reasonably
believes that such sale or forfeiture is threatened. Any surplus retained by
Lender after payment of the Imposition or Claim for which

                                       53
<PAGE>

a deposit was made shall be promptly repaid to the Borrowers unless an Event of
Default shall have occurred, in which case said surplus may be retained by
Lender to be applied to the Obligations. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section to the contrary, the Borrowers shall pay any Imposition or Claim which
they might otherwise be entitled to contest if an Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing, or if, in the reasonable determination of Lender, the
applicable Property is in danger of being forfeited or foreclosed. If the
Borrowers refuse to pay any such Imposition or Claim, Lender may (but shall not
be obligated to) make such payment and the Borrowers shall reimburse Lender on
demand for all such advances.

SECTION 5.4 MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE.

      The Borrowers will continuously maintain the following described policies
of insurance on each of the respective Properties without cost to Lender (the
"INSURANCE POLICIES"):

            (i)   Property insurance against loss and damage by all risks of
physical loss or damage, including fire, sprinkler leakage, windstorm,

aggregate for any policy year;

            (iii) If any of the Properties are in an area prone to geological

$25,000 or 10% of the face value of the policy;

            (iv)  For each Property located in whole or in part in a federally

and automobile liability coverage, and coverage for safeguarding of personalty
and shall also include such additional coverages and insured risks which are
acceptable to Lender;

            (vi)  Business interruption and/or rent loss insurance with an

                                       54
<PAGE>

            (vii) Crime protection insurance covering all employees with access

            (viii) Steam boiler, machinery and pressurized vessel insurance
insuring against breakdown or explosion of such equipment on a replacement cost

            (ix)  Worker's Compensation Insurance in statutory amounts, if any,
at all times;

            (x)   Insurance against loss or damage from (A) leakage of sprinkler

            (xi)  During any period of construction, repair or restoration,
builder's "all risk" insurance in an amount equal to not less than the full
insurable value of the Properties (excluding building foundations and footings)
against such risks (including, without limitation, fire and extended coverage
and collapse of the Improvements to agreed limits) as Lender may reasonably
request;

            (xii) If the Properties are or become a "non-conforming use" under
applicable zoning and building ordinances, or other requirements of the
applicable Governmental Authority, law or ordinance coverage to compensate for
the cost of demolition and the increased cost of construction, if available;

            (xiii) If the Borrowers, Manager or any of their respective
Affiliates holds a liquor license for the Properties, liquor liability insurance
(including "dram shop" liability) in an amount not less than $1,000,000 for each
common cause and $3,000,000 in the aggregate; provided that if such liquor
license is held by any tenant under a Lease, the Borrowers shall cause such

set forth above to be carried in such tenant's name, and shall include the
Borrowers and Lender as additional insureds thereunder;

            (xiv) If reasonably required by Lender as a result of the release,
disposal or existence of any Hazardous Materials on or about any Property after
the date hereof (or as to which Lender obtains knowledge after the date hereof)
or if such insurance is then customarily required by institutional lenders for
securitized loans, environmental insurance, including mold coverage, in form and
with coverages (including business interruption coverage) reasonably
satisfactory to Lender; provided, however, without limiting or affecting
Lender's right to require such environmental insurance with respect to any other
Properties after the date hereof, Lender acknowledges that, as of the date
hereof, environmental insurance shall only be required with respect to the
Property known as the Holiday Inn Express, located at 801 Cleveland Avenue,
Attalla, Alabama;

                                       55
<PAGE>

            (xv)  Fiduciary liability insurance and directors and officers
liability insurance ("D&O INSURANCE") with coverages at levels in effect as of
the Closing Date;

            (xvi) Insurance against acts of terrorism, or insurance policies
without an exclusion for damages resulting from acts of terrorism on terms
consistent with the commercial property insurance policies required under
subsection (i), (ii), (v) and (vi) above;

            (xvii) Such other insurance as may from time to time be reasonably
required by Lender and which is then customarily required by institutional
lenders for securitized loans secured by similar properties similarly situated,
against other insurable hazards, including, but not limited to, malicious
mischief, vandalism, windstorm and or earthquake, due regard to be given to the
size and type of the Properties, Improvements, fixtures and equipment and their
location, construction and use. Additionally, the Borrowers shall carry such
insurance coverage as Lender may from time to time require if the failure to
carry such insurance would result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of
any class of securities issued in connection with a Securitization.

      All Insurance Policies shall be in content (including, without limitation,
endorsements or exclusions, if any), form, and amounts, and issued by companies,
satisfactory to Lender from time to time and shall name Lender and its
successors and assignees as their interests may appear as (x) an "additional
insured" for each of the liability policies under this Section 5.4 hereof, and
(y) a "mortgagee" for each of the property and casualty policies under this
Section hereof, and shall (except for Worker's Compensation Insurance) contain a
waiver of subrogation clause reasonably acceptable to Lender. Other than with
respect to D&O Insurance, an insurance company shall not be satisfactory unless
such insurance company (a) is licensed or authorized to issue insurance in the
State where the applicable Property is located and (b) has a claims paying
ability rating by the Rating Agencies of AA- (or its equivalent).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a carrier which does not meet the foregoing
ratings requirement shall nevertheless be deemed acceptable hereunder provided
that such carrier is reasonably acceptable to Lender and the Borrowers shall
obtain and deliver to Lender a Rating Confirmation with respect to such carrier
from each of the Rating Agencies, provided, however, that: (a) if any insurance
coverage required under this Section 5.4 is maintained by a syndicate of
insurers, the preceding ratings requirements shall be deemed satisfied (without
any required Rating Confirmation) as long as at least seventy five percent (75%)
of the coverage (if there are four or fewer members of the syndicate) or at
least sixty percent (60%) of the coverage (if there are five or more members of
the syndicate) is maintained with carriers meeting the claims-paying ability
ratings requirements by S&P and Moody's (if applicable) set forth above and all
carriers in such syndicate have a claims-paying ability rating by S&P of not
less than "BBB" and by Moody's of not less than "Baa2" (to the extent rated by
Moody's); (b) Lender hereby approves Zurich Insurance Company as the carrier
providing the insurance described in clause (ii) above, so long as such carrier
maintains a claims paying ability of not less than A- by S&P (and the equivalent
from each of the other Rating Agencies to the extent rated thereby) and (c)
until the expiration of the current term of the applicable policies, Lender
hereby approves Landmark American as the carrier providing the insurance
described in clauses (i), (iv) and (vi) above (covering losses over the first
$25,000,000 of coverage), so long as thereafter such carrier or any other
carrier providing the above coverages maintains a claims paying ability of not
less than A by S&P (and the equivalent from each of the other Rating Agencies to
the extent rated thereby). All Insurance Policies under

                                       56
<PAGE>

Sections 5.4 (i), (iv), (vi), (vii), (x), (xi) and (xii) hereof shall contain a
Non-Contributory Standard mortgagee clause and a mortgagee's Loss Payable
Endorsement (Form 438 BFU NS), or their equivalents (such endorsements shall
entitle Lender to collect any and all proceeds payable under all such insurance,
with the insurance company waiving any claim or defense against Lender for
premium payment, deductible, self-insured retention or claims reporting
provisions). All Insurance Policies shall provide that the coverage shall not be
modified without (30) days' advance written notice to Lender and shall provide
that no claims shall be paid thereunder to a Person other than Lender without
ten (10) days' advance written notice to Lender. The Borrowers may obtain any
insurance required by this Section through blanket policies; provided, however,
that such blanket policies shall separately set forth the amount of insurance in
force with respect to the Properties (which shall not be reduced by reason of
events occurring on property other than the Properties) and shall afford all the
protections to Lender as are required under this Section. Except as may be
expressly provided above, all policies of insurance required hereunder shall
contain no annual aggregate limit of liability, other than with respect to
liability insurance. If a blanket policy is issued, a certified copy of said
policy shall be furnished, together with a certificate indicating that Lender is
an additional insured (and, if applicable, loss payee) under such policy in the
designated amount. The Borrowers will deliver duplicate originals of all
Insurance Policies, premium prepaid through the current expiration dates of such
Insurance Policies, to Lender and, in case of Insurance Policies about to
expire, the Borrowers will deliver duplicate originals of replacement policies
satisfying the requirements hereof to Lender not less than ten (10) days prior
to the date of expiration; provided, however, if such replacement policy is not
yet available, the Borrowers shall provide Lender with an insurance certificate
executed by the insurer or its authorized agent evidencing that the insurance
required hereunder is being maintained under such policy, which certificate
shall be acceptable to Lender on an interim basis until the duplicate original
of the policy is available. The Borrowers shall furnish Lender receipts for the
payment of premiums on such insurance policies or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to Lender in the event that such premiums have not been
paid by Lender pursuant to the Loan Agreement. The requirements of this Section
5.4 shall apply to any separate policies of insurance taken out by the Borrowers
concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with the Insurance
Policies. Losses shall be payable to Lender notwithstanding (1) any act, failure
to act or negligence of the Borrowers or their agents or employees, Lender or
any other insured party which might, absent such agreement, result in a
forfeiture or all or part of such insurance payment, other than the willful
misconduct of Lender knowingly in violation of the conditions of such policy,
(2) the occupation or use of the Properties or any part thereof for purposes
more hazardous than permitted by the terms of such policy, (3) any foreclosure
or other action or proceeding taken pursuant to this Loan Agreement or (4) any
change in title to or ownership of the Properties or any part thereof. The
property insurance and the boiler and machinery insurance described in Sections
5.4(i) and (x) hereof shall include "underground hazards" coverage; "time
element" coverage by which Lender shall be assured payment of all amounts due
under the Note, this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents; "extra
expense" (i.e., soft costs), clean-up, transit and ordinary payroll coverage;
and "expediting expense" coverage to facilitate rapid repair or restoration of
the Properties. The Insurance Policies shall not contain any deductible in
excess of $250,000.

SECTION 5.5 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTIES; CASUALTY.

      (A)   The Borrowers will operate and maintain the Properties as is
necessary to maintain hotel standards at least as high as those that currently
apply to each Property, subject to ordinary wear and tear, as reasonably
determined by the Borrowers, and otherwise in compliance with the standards
under the applicable Franchise Agreement and shall maintain or cause to be
maintained in good repair, working order and condition all material property
used in the business of each Borrower, including the applicable Property, and
will make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements
thereof. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Borrower will operate and
maintain its Property substantially in accordance with the applicable Operating
Budget and the CapEx/FF&E Budget. All work required or permitted under this Loan
Agreement shall be performed in a workmanlike manner and in compliance with all
applicable laws.

      So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Borrowers may, without Lender's consent, perform alterations to the Properties
which do not constitute a Material Alteration. The Borrowers shall not perform
any Material Alteration without Lender's prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however,
that Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, withhold consent to any
Material Alteration which is likely to result in a decrease of Net Operating
Income (taking into consideration all Material Alterations being undertaken at
the Properties at such time) by 5% or more below that which was in effect prior
to the commencement of the first such Material Alteration being undertaken at
the time of determination for a period of sixty (60) days or longer; provided,
further, however, the Borrowers may perform a Material Alteration without
Lender's consent if (i) the delay caused by obtaining Lender's prior consent may
result in injury or death at, or further destruction or deterioration of, the
applicable Property, (ii) such Material Alteration is necessary to prevent the
likelihood of injury or death at, or further destruction or deterioration of,
the applicable Property, and (iii) the Borrowers deliver notice to Lender within
two (2) Business Days of commencement of such Material Alteration together with
such supporting documentation as Lender may require with respect to such
Material Alteration. Lender may, as a condition to giving its consent to a
Material Alteration, require that the Borrowers deliver to Lender evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the Borrowers have cash available for
payment of the cost of such Material Alteration or, if the Borrowers fail to
deliver such evidence, cash, Dollar Equivalents or a Letter of Credit, in an
amount equal to 125% of the cost of such Material Alteration as reasonably
estimated by Lender. Cash deposited by the Borrowers with Lender in connection
with any Material Alteration pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be held by
Lender in a Sub-Account of the Lock Box Account and disbursed to the Borrowers
to pay for the cost of such Material Alteration as such work progresses subject
to satisfaction of the conditions for disbursement of amounts from the Capital
Improvement Reserve under Section 6.5 (including the requirements set forth
under Section 6.7). Upon completion of the Material Alteration, the Borrowers
shall provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that (i) the Material
Alteration was constructed in accordance with all material applicable laws and
substantially in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Lender
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) all
contractors, subcontractors, materialmen and professionals who provided work,
materials or services in connection with the Material Alteration have been paid
in full and have delivered unconditional releases of lien and (iii) all material
licenses necessary for the use, operation and occupancy of the Material
Alteration (other

                                       58
<PAGE>

than those which depend on the performance of tenant improvement work) have been
issued. The Borrowers shall reimburse Lender upon demand for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees of any
architect, engineer or other professional engaged by Lender) incurred by Lender
in reviewing plans and specifications or in making any determinations necessary
to implement the provisions of this Section 5.5(A).

      (B)   In the event of casualty or loss at any of the Properties, the
Borrowers shall give immediate written notice of the same to the insurance
carrier and to Lender and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute to
completion, in accordance with the terms hereof, the repair and restoration of
the Property as nearly as possible to the Pre-Existing Condition (a
"RESTORATION"). The Borrowers hereby authorize and empower Lender as
attorney-in-fact for the Borrowers (jointly with the Borrowers unless an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing), or any of them, to make proof of
loss, to adjust and compromise any claim under insurance policies, to appear in
and prosecute any action arising from such insurance policies, to collect and
receive insurance proceeds, and to deduct therefrom Lender's expenses incurred
in the collection of such proceeds; provided however, that nothing contained in
this Section shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action
hereunder. The Borrowers further authorize Lender, at Lender's option, (i) to
hold the balance of such proceeds to be used to reimburse the Borrowers for the
cost of Restoration of any of the Properties or (ii) subject to Subsection
5.5(C), to apply such proceeds to payment of the Obligations whether or not then
due, in any order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a casualty
where the loss does not exceed the Restoration Threshold, the Borrowers may
settle and adjust such claim; provided that (a) no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and (b) such adjustment is carried out in a commercially
reasonable and timely manner.

      (C)   Lender shall not exercise Lender's option to apply insurance
proceeds to payment of the Obligations if all of the following conditions are
met: (i) no Event of Default then exists; (ii) Lender reasonably determines that
there will be sufficient funds to complete the Restoration of the Property to at
least substantially the Pre-Existing Condition and to timely make all payments
due under the Loan Documents during the Restoration of the affected Property;
(iii) Lender reasonably determines that the Net Operating Income of the
Properties (including rental income or business interruption insurance) will be
sufficient to pay principal and interest on the Loan and the Mezzanine Loan and
Operating Revenues of the Properties, after the Restoration thereof to the
Pre-Existing Condition, will be sufficient to meet all Operating Expenses,
payments for Reserves and payments of principal and interest under the Note and
the Mezzanine Loan; (iv) Lender determines that the Restoration of the affected
Property to the Pre-Existing Condition will be completed not later than five (5)
months prior to the expiration of any business interruption insurance, but in no
event later than six (6) months prior to the Maturity Date; (v) less than fifty
percent (50%) of the total floor area of the Improvements has been damaged,
destroyed or rendered unusable as a result of such fire or other casualty; and
(vi) such Property can be restored and repaired substantially to the condition
it was in immediately prior to such casualty and in compliance with all
applicable zoning, building and other laws and codes (the "PRE-EXISTING
CONDITION"). If Lender elects to apply insurance proceeds to payment of the
Obligations, such application shall be made on the Payment Date immediately
following such election in accordance with the terms of the Cash Management
Agreement.

                                       59
<PAGE>

      (D)   If Lender elects or is obligated to make the insurance proceeds
available for the Restoration of any Property and Lender is holding such
proceeds, the Borrowers agree that, if at any time during the Restoration, the
cost of completing such Restoration, as reasonably determined by Lender, exceeds
the undisbursed insurance proceeds, the Borrowers shall, within ten (10)
Business Days following the written demand by Lender, deposit the amount of such
excess with Lender, and Lender shall first disburse such deposit to pay for the
costs of such Restoration on the same terms and conditions as the insurance
proceeds are disbursed. If the Borrowers deposit such excess with Lender and if,
after completion of the Restoration, any funds remain from the combination of
insurance proceeds and the funds so deposited with Lender by the Borrowers, and
if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then Lender shall
promptly disburse to the Borrowers such remaining funds.

      (E)   Lender may, at Lender's option, condition disbursement of any
insurance proceeds on Lender's approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) of plans and specifications of an independent architect
licensed in the state where the Property is located and reasonably satisfactory
to Lender (the "ARCHITECT"), any and all contractors, subcontractors and
materialmen engaged in the Restoration and the contracts under which they have
been engaged, contractor's cost estimates, architect's certificates, waivers of
liens, sworn statements of mechanics and materialmen and such other evidence of
costs, percentage completion of construction, application of payments, and
satisfaction of liens as Lender may reasonably require. Lender shall not be
obligated to disburse insurance proceeds more frequently than once every
calendar month. If insurance proceeds are applied to the payment of the
Obligations and provided no Event of Default exists, any such application of
proceeds to principal shall be without any Prepayment Consideration and shall
not extend or postpone the due dates of the monthly payments due under the Note
or otherwise under the Loan Documents, or change the amounts of such payments.
If Lender elects to apply all of such insurance proceeds toward the repayment of
the Obligations, the Borrowers shall (subject to compliance with clauses (A),
(B), (D) and (F) of Section 11.4) be entitled to obtain from Lender a Property
Release (without representation or warranty) of the applicable Property from the
Lien of the Mortgage relating to such Property (in which event the Borrowers
shall not be obligated to restore the applicable Property pursuant to Section
5.5(B) above) provided that the Borrowers pay to Lender the amount, if any, by
which the Release Price for such Property exceeds the insurance proceeds
received by Lender and applied to repayment of the Obligations. If any proceeds
are applied to reduce the Obligations under this Section 5.5, provided that no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no Prepayment Consideration
shall be due and payable in connection with such application. Any amount of
insurance proceeds remaining in Lender's possession after full and final payment
and discharge of all Obligations shall be refunded to, or as directed by, the
Borrowers or otherwise paid in accordance with applicable law. If the Property
is sold at foreclosure or if Lender acquires title to the Property, Lender shall
have all of the right, title and interest of the applicable Borrower in and to
any insurance policies and unearned premiums thereon and in and to the proceeds
resulting from any damage to such Property prior to such sale or acquisition.

      (F)   In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
insurance proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually incurred
from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by
the Architect, less a retainage equal to the lesser of (x) the actual retainage
required pursuant to the permitted contract, or (y) ten percent

                                       60
<PAGE>

(10%) of such costs incurred until the Restoration has been completed. The
retainage shall in no event be less than the amount actually held back by the
Borrowers from contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the
Restoration. The retainage shall not be released until the Architect certifies
to Lender, or, if no Architect has been retained by Lender, Lender is reasonably
satisfied, that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 5.5 and that all approvals necessary for the
re-occupancy and use of the Property have been obtained from all appropriate
governmental authorities, and Lender receives final lien waivers and such other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration
have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the retainage.

SECTION 5.6 INSPECTION. Each Borrower shall permit any authorized
representatives designated by Lender to visit and inspect during normal business
hours its Property and its business, including its financial and accounting
records, and to make copies and take extracts therefrom and to discuss its
affairs, finances and business with its officers and independent public
accountants (with such Borrower's representative(s) present), at such reasonable
times during normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably requested.
Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall provide
advance written notice of at least three (3) Business Days prior to visiting or
inspecting any Property or such Borrower's offices.

SECTION 5.7 O&M PLAN. Each Borrower that is the owner of a Property set forth on
SCHEDULE 5.7 shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Lender an operations
and maintenance program (the "O&M PLANS") with respect to suspected asbestos,
asbestos-containing materials, and/or mold located in its Property as set forth
in the applicable Environmental Reports. Each Borrower shall at all times
implement and carry out the O&M Plan in accordance with its terms. Lender's
requirement that the Borrowers develop and comply with the O&M Plan shall not be
deemed to constitute a waiver or modification of any covenants or agreements of
the Borrowers or Guarantor with respect to Hazardous Material or Environmental
Laws as set forth in the Environmental Indemnity.

SECTION 5.8 INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

SECTION 5.9 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The Borrowers will
(A) comply with the requirements of all present and future applicable laws,
rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authority in all jurisdictions
in which it is now doing business or may hereafter be doing business, other than
those laws, rules, regulations and orders the noncompliance with which would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the operation or value of any Property, (B) maintain
all licenses and permits now held or hereafter acquired by any Borrower, the
loss, suspension, or revocation of which, or failure to renew, could have a
material adverse effect on the operation or value of any Property and (C)
perform, observe, comply and fulfill all of its material obligations, covenants
and conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation.

SECTION 5.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES. The Borrowers shall, from time to time, execute
and/or deliver such documents, instruments, agreements, financing statements,
and perform such acts as Lender at any time may reasonably request to evidence,
preserve and/or protect the Collateral at any time securing or intended to
secure the Obligations and/or to better and more effectively carry out the
purposes of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                                       61

SECTION 5.11 PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS AND LEASES. Each Primary Borrower Party
shall duly and punctually perform, observe and comply in all material respects
with all of the terms, provisions, conditions, covenants and agreements on its
part to be performed, observed and complied with (i) hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents to which it is a party, (ii) under all Material Agreements
and Leases and (iii) all other agreements entered into or assumed by such Person
in connection with the Properties, and will not suffer or permit any material
default or event of default (giving effect to any applicable notice requirements
and cure periods) to exist under any of the foregoing except where the failure
to perform, observe or comply with any agreement referred to in this clause
(iii) would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
operation or value of any Property.

SECTION 5.12 LEASES. (A) Without the prior written consent of Lender, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Borrowers shall not, nor
shall the Borrowers authorize Manager or any other Person to, (i) enter into any
Material Lease; (ii) cancel or terminate any Material Lease (except to enforce
any such Lease after a default thereunder); (iii) amend or modify any Material
Lease (except for minor modifications and amendments entered into in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with prudent property management
practices, not materially and adversely affecting the economic terms of the
Material Lease); (iv) approve any assignment, sublease or underlease of any
Material Lease (except as required pursuant to the express terms of any existing
Lease or Lease hereafter approved by Lender); or (v) cancel or modify any
guaranty, or release any security deposit, letter of credit, or other item
constituting security pertaining to any Material Lease (except as required
pursuant to the express terms of any existing Lease or Lease hereafter approved
by Lender).

      (B)   Any request for approval of any Material Lease or assignment,
termination, amendment or modification of any Material Lease shall be made to
Lender in writing and together with such request the Borrowers shall furnish to
Lender: (i) such biographical and financial information about the proposed
tenant as Lender may reasonably require in conjunction with its review, (ii) a
copy of the proposed form of Lease (or amendment or modification), and (iii) a
summary of the material terms of such proposed Lease (or amendment or
modification) including, without limitation, rental terms and the term of the
proposed Lease and any options. Lender's approval of any Material Lease or
assignment, termination, amendment or modification of any Material Lease, shall
be deemed given, if the first correspondence from the Borrowers to Lender
requesting such approval is in an envelope marked "PRIORITY" and contains a
bold-faced, conspicuous legend at the top of the first page thereof stating that
"IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR TO EXPRESSLY DENY THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN
WRITING WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) DAYS, YOUR APPROVAL MAY BE DEEMED GIVEN", and is
accompanied by the information and documents required above and any other
information reasonably requested by Lender in writing prior to the expiration of
such fifteen (15) day period in order to adequately review the same has been
delivered and, if Lender fails to respond or to expressly deny such request for

delivered to Lender from the Borrowers in an envelope marked "PRIORITY"
requesting approval containing a bold-faced, conspicuous legend at the top of
the first page thereof stating that "IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR EXPRESSLY DENY
THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS, YOUR APPROVAL SHALL
BE DEEMED GIVEN" and Lender fails to respond or to expressly deny each request
for approval within the ten (10) day period.

                                       62
<PAGE>

      Except for security deposits, no Material Lease executed after the Closing
Date shall provide for payment of rent more than one month in advance, and the
Borrowers shall not under any circumstances collect any such rent more than one
month in advance. The Borrowers, at Lender's request, shall furnish Lender with
executed copies of all Material Leases hereafter made. Each new Material Lease
or a separate agreement with the tenant of such Material Lease shall be in
recordable form and shall specifically provide that such Material Lease (i) is
subordinate to the Mortgages; (ii) that the tenant attorns to Lender, such
attornment to be effective upon Lender's acquisition of title to the Property;
(iii) that the tenant agrees to execute such further evidences of attornment as
Lender may from time to time request; (iv) that the attornment of the tenant
shall not be terminated by foreclosure; (v) that in no event shall Lender, as
holder of the Mortgages or as successor landlord, be liable to the tenant for
any act or omission of any prior landlord or for any liability or obligation of
any prior landlord occurring prior to the date that Lender or any subsequent
owner acquire title to the Property; and (vi) that Lender may, at Lender's
option, accept or reject such attornment.

SECTION 5.13 MANAGEMENT; FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS.

      (A)   The Borrowers shall cause each Manager to manage the Properties in
accordance with the Management Agreements including, without limitation,
maintaining inventory in amounts and types customary for hotels comparable to
each Property. The Borrowers shall (i) perform and observe all of the material
terms, covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement on the part of each
Borrower to be performed and observed, and (ii) promptly notify Lender of any
notice to any of the Borrowers of any material default under the Management
Agreement of which it is aware. If any of the Borrowers shall default in the
performance or observance of any material term, covenant or condition of the
applicable Management Agreement on the part of the Borrowers to be performed or
observed, then, without limiting Lender's other rights or remedies under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and without waiving or releasing the
Borrowers from any of their obligations hereunder or under the applicable
Management Agreement, Lender shall have the right, upon prior written notice to
the Borrower, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform
any act as may be reasonably appropriate to cause such material conditions of
the applicable Management Agreement on the part of the Borrowers to be performed
or observed.

      (B)   The Borrowers shall not surrender, terminate, cancel, modify (other
than non-material changes), renew or extend the Management Agreement, or enter
into any other Management Agreement with Manager or any new Manager, or consent
to the assignment by the Manager of its interest under the Management Agreement,
in each case without (i) prior to a Securitization, the express consent of
Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) after a
Securitization, delivery of Rating Confirmations from each of the Rating
Agencies. The Borrowers shall cause any new Manager with respect to any Property
to execute and deliver a subordination of management agreement in substantially
the form delivered in connection with the closing of the Loan.

      (C)   Lender shall have the right to require any of the Borrowers to
replace any Manager with a Person chosen by the Borrowers and reasonably
acceptable to Lender (unless such proposed Manager is an Acceptable Manager) and
the applicable Franchisor (to the extent the applicable Franchisor has consent
rights), upon the earliest to occur of any one or more of the

                                       63
<PAGE>

following events: (i) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default; (ii) thirty (30) days after notice from Lender to the Borrowers if
Manager has engaged in fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct arising
from or in connection with its performance under the applicable Management
Agreement; or (iii) upon a change of control of the current Manager.

      (D)   The Borrowers shall not terminate or enter into any Franchise
Agreement without Lender's prior written consent, which may be granted or
withheld in Lender's sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
following changes to Franchise Agreements shall be permitted without Lender's
prior written consent:

            (i)   Replacement of any Franchise Agreement with a new Franchise
                  Agreement in form substantially similar to a form previously
                  approved by Lender with any Franchisor that would cause a Tier
                  3 Hotel to become either a Tier 2 Hotel or a Tier 1 Hotel, or
                  that would cause a Tier 2 Hotel to become a Tier 1 Hotel;

            (ii)  Replacement of any Franchise Agreement with a new Franchise
                  Agreement in form substantially similar to a form previously
                  approved by Lender with another Franchisor within the same
                  Category, provided that the Borrowers shall not replace
                  Franchise Agreements (in the aggregate) pursuant to this
                  Section 5.13(D)(ii) with respect to more than the lesser of
                  (x) three (3) Properties, or (y) Properties with Aggregate
                  Allocated Loan Amounts (in the aggregate) of ten percent (10%)
                  of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance;

            (iii) Replacement of any Franchise Agreement at a Tier 2 Hotel with
                  a new Franchise Agreement in form substantially similar to a
                  form previously approved by Lender for Tier 3 Hotels, provided
                  that the Borrowers shall not replace Franchise Agreements (in
                  the aggregate) pursuant to this Section 5.13(D)(iii) with
                  respect to more than the lesser of (x) two (2) Properties, or
                  (y) Properties with Aggregate Allocated Loan Amounts (in the
                  aggregate) of three percent (3%) (in each case under clauses
                  (x) or (y), exclusive of the Franchise Agreement for the
                  Holiday Inn, located at 5252 New Jessup Highway, Brunswick,
                  Georgia 31525, which is in the process of being reflagged as a
                  "Park Inn");

            (iv)  Entering into a new Franchise Agreement in form substantially
                  similar to a form previously approved by Lender with an
                  Acceptable Franchisor for any of the Non-Flagged Hotels, at
                  which time the applicable Property shall be deemed to be
                  within the Category determined by the applicable Franchise
                  Agreement;

            (v)   Entering into a new Franchise Agreement in form substantially
                  similar to a form previously approved by Lender with Park
                  Hospitality LLC under the "Park Inn" brand for the hotel
                  located at 5252 New Jessup Highway, Brunswick, Georgia 31525
                  at which time the applicable Property shall be deemed to be a
                  Tier 3 Hotel; and

                                       64
<PAGE>

            (vi)  Entering into new Franchise Agreements (or amendments or
                  addenda to existing Franchise Agreements) with the existing
                  Franchisors for the applicable Properties for the same
                  franchise brand, each in form substantially similar to the
                  forms previously approved for the respective Properties by
                  Lender, as required by the existing Franchisors under the
                  respective Franchise Agreements in connection with the
                  transfers of the applicable Properties and the direct and
                  indirect ownership interests in the Borrowers made by the
                  Borrower Parties and their Affiliates in connection with the
                  Closing of the Loan.

      In connection with the replacement of any Franchisors permitted hereunder,
the applicable Borrower shall, within ten (10) Business Days of the execution of
such Franchise Agreement, deliver to Lender a Franchisor Letter from any
replacement Franchisor in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender. In
all cases, each Borrower shall (a) cause the hotel located on the applicable
Property to be operated pursuant to the applicable Franchise Agreement; (b)
promptly perform and observe in all material respects all of the covenants
required to be performed and observed by it under the applicable Franchise
Agreement (including the requirements of any Property Improvement Plan); (c)
promptly notify Lender of any material default under the applicable Franchise
Agreement of which it is aware; and (d) promptly enforce in a commercially
reasonable manner the performance and observance of all of the material
covenants required to be performed and observed by the Franchisor under the
Franchise Agreement. In addition, the Borrowers shall not, without Lender's
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed: (x) increase or consent to the increase of the aggregate
amount of any fees under any Franchise Agreement; or (y) otherwise materially
modify, change, supplement, alter or amend, or waive or release any of its
material rights and remedies under, any Franchise Agreement.

      Lender's consent to any replacement of any Franchise Agreement, or the
termination, renewal, extension or modification of an existing Franchise
Agreement, shall be deemed given, if the first correspondence from the Borrowers
to Lender requesting such consent is in an envelope marked "PRIORITY" and
contains a bold-faced, conspicuous legend at the top of the first page thereof
stating that "IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR TO EXPRESSLY DENY THIS REQUEST FOR
APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) DAYS, YOUR APPROVAL MAY BE DEEMED
GIVEN", and is accompanied by the information and documents required above and
any other information reasonably requested by Lender in writing prior to the
expiration of such fifteen (15) day period in order to adequately review the
same has been delivered and, if Lender fails to respond or to expressly deny
such request for approval in writing within the fifteen (15) day period, a
second notice is delivered to Lender from the Borrowers in an envelope marked
"PRIORITY" requesting approval containing a bold-faced, conspicuous legend at
the top of the first page thereof stating that "IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR
EXPRESSLY DENY THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS, YOUR
APPROVAL SHALL BE DEEMED GIVEN" and Lender fails to respond or to expressly deny
each request for approval within the ten (10) day period.

SECTION 5.14 MATERIAL AGREEMENTS. The Borrowers shall not enter into or become
obligated under any Material Agreement pertaining to any Property without
Lender's prior written

                                       65
<PAGE>

except that the following Material Agreements shall not require Lender approval:
(i) any Lease that does not require Lender's approval under, and otherwise
complies with, the provisions of Section 5.12 hereof, (ii) any Management
Agreement that does not require Lender's approval under, and otherwise complies
with, the provisions of Section 5.13 hereof (provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not affect Borrowers' obligation to deliver Rating Confirmations
with respect to any such Management Agreement if required under Section 5.13),
(iii) the existing Material Agreements described on SCHEDULE 5.14 attached
hereto, (iv) any Franchise Agreement that does not require Lender's approval

with any director, officer or employee of any Borrower Party, except
transactions in the ordinary course of and pursuant to the reasonable
requirements of the business of the Borrowers and upon fair and reasonable terms

Involuntary Borrower Bankruptcy, no Borrower Party shall, without the prior
written consent of Lender, consent to the entry of any order, file any motion,
or support any motion (irrespective of the subject of the motion), and the
Borrowers shall not file or support any plan of reorganization. The Borrowers
having any interest in any Involuntary Borrower Bankruptcy shall do all things
reasonably requested by Lender to assist Lender in obtaining such relief as
Lender shall seek, and shall in all events vote as directed by Lender. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each such Borrower shall do all things reasonably
requested by Lender to support any motion for relief from stay or plan of
reorganization proposed or supported by Lender.

      (B)   COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA. The Borrowers shall not: (i) engage in any
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the IRC; or (ii) except as may be necessary to comply with applicable laws,
establish or amend any Employee Benefit Plan which establishment or amendment
could result in liability to the Borrowers or any ERISA Affiliate or increase
the obligation of the Borrowers, provided that the Borrower shall not be in
default of this covenant if, in either case, any portion of the Loan has been,
or will be, funded with plan assets of any employee benefit plan that either (x)
is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan that is covered by Section 4975 of
the Code (unless the Lender is eligible to apply for one or more exemptions such
that the Loan will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA) or (y) could subject a Borrower Party or its Affiliates to
an excise tax under Section 4975 of the IRC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, the Borrowers shall be permitted
to make such filings and disclosures with respect to the Loan as are required by
law.

SECTION 5.25 GROUND LEASES.

      (A)   NO MODIFICATION. The Borrowers shall not modify or amend, or
terminate or surrender any Ground Lease, in each case without the prior written
consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld by Lender in its sole and
absolute discretion. Any attempted or purported modification, amendment, or any
surrender or termination of any Ground Lease without Lender's prior written
consent shall be null and void and of no force or effect.

      (B)   PERFORMANCE OF GROUND LEASES. The Borrowers shall fully perform as
and when due each and all of its obligations under each Ground Lease in
accordance with the terms of such Ground Lease, and shall not cause or suffer to
occur any material breach or default in any of such obligations. The Borrowers
shall keep and maintain each Ground Lease in full force and effect. The
Borrowers shall exercise any option to renew or extend any Ground Lease and give
written confirmation thereof to Lender within thirty (30) days after such option
is exercised. Notwithstanding that certain of the obligations of the Borrowers
under this Loan Agreement may be similar or identical to certain of the
obligations of the Borrowers under the Ground Leases, all of the obligations of
the Borrowers under this Loan Agreement are and shall be separate from and in
addition to its obligations under the Ground Leases.

      (C)   NOTICE OF DEFAULT. If any of the Borrowers shall have or receive any
written notice that any Ground Lease Default has occurred, then the Borrowers
immediately shall notify Lender in writing of the same and immediately deliver
to Lender a true and complete copy of each such notice. Further, the Borrowers
shall provide such documents and information as Lender shall reasonably request
concerning the Ground Lease Default.

      (D)   LENDER'S RIGHT TO CURE. If any Ground Lease Default shall occur and
be continuing, or if any Ground Lessor asserts that a Ground Lease Default has
occurred (whether or not the Borrowers question or deny such assertion), then,
subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Ground Lease, Lender, upon
five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Borrowers, unless Lender
reasonably determines that a shorter period (or no period) of notice is
necessary to protect Lender's interest in the Ground Lease, may (but shall not
be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems reasonably necessary,
including, without limitation, (i) performance or attempted performance of the
applicable Borrower's obligations under the applicable Ground Lease, (ii) curing
or attempting to cure any actual or purported Ground Lease Default, (iii)
mitigating or attempting to mitigate any damages or consequences of the same and

                                       69
<PAGE>

(iv) entry upon the applicable Ground Leased Property for any or all of such
purposes. Upon Lender's request, each Borrower shall submit satisfactory
evidence of payment or performance of any of its obligations under each Ground
Lease. Lender may pay and expend such sums of money as Lender in its sole
discretion deems necessary or desirable for any such purpose, and the Borrowers
shall pay to Lender within five (5) Business Days of the written demand of
Lender all such sums so paid or expended by Lender, together with interest
thereon from the date of expenditure at the Default Rate.

      (E)   LEGAL ACTION. The Borrowers shall not commence any action or
proceeding against any Ground Lessor or affecting or potentially affecting any
Ground Lease or the Borrowers' or Lender's interest therein, the effect of which
could cause an event of default or termination of any such Ground Lease, without
the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Borrowers shall notify Lender immediately
if any action or proceeding shall be commenced between any Ground Lessor and
either Borrower, or affecting or potentially affecting any Ground Lease or
either Borrower's or Lender's interest therein (including, without limitation,
any case commenced by or against any Ground Lessor under the Bankruptcy Code).
Lender shall have the option, exercisable upon notice from Lender to the
Borrowers, to participate in any such action or proceeding with counsel of
Lender's choice. The Borrowers shall cooperate with Lender, comply with the
reasonable instructions of Lender, execute any and all powers, authorizations,
consents or other documents reasonably required by Lender in connection
therewith, and shall not settle any such action or proceeding without the prior
written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

      (F)   ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Ground Lease, from time to time, at Lender's request, the Borrowers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Lender within
the time period required under the applicable Ground Lease, an estoppel
certificate from each Ground Lessor setting forth (A) (i) the identities of the
original lessor and lessee under the applicable Ground Lease and each of their
respective successors, (ii) that the Ground Lease has not been modified or, if
it has been modified, the date of each modification (together with copies of
each such modification), (iii) the rent payable under the Ground Lease, (iv) the
dates to which all rent and other charges have been paid, (v) whether there are
any alleged Ground Lease Defaults and, if so, setting forth the nature thereof
in reasonable detail, and (vi) such other matters as Lender may reasonably
request or (B) the matters required to be certified by the Ground Lessor under
the applicable Ground Lease. The Borrowers shall not be required to request an
estoppel from any Ground Lessor more than two (2) times in any calendar year.

      (G)   BANKRUPTCY.

            (i)   If any Ground Lessor shall reject any Ground Lease under or
pursuant to Section 365 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Borrowers shall
not elect to treat the Ground Lease as terminated but shall elect to remain in
possession of the applicable Ground Leased Property and the leasehold estate
under such Ground Lease. The lien of the Mortgage covering such Property does
and shall encumber and attach to all of the Borrowers' rights and remedies at
any time arising under or pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code,
including without

                                       70
<PAGE>

limitation, all of such Borrower's rights to remain in possession of such
Property and the leasehold estate.

            (ii)  The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that in any case commenced
by or against the Borrowers under the Bankruptcy Code, Lender by reason of the
liens and rights granted under the Mortgage covering such Property and the Loan
Documents shall have a substantial and material interest in the treatment and
preservation of such Borrower's rights and obligations under such Ground Lease,
and that such Borrower shall, in any such bankruptcy case, provide to Lender
immediate and continuous reasonably adequate protection of such interests. Each
Borrower and Lender agree that such adequate protection shall include but shall
not necessarily be limited to the following:

                  (a)   Lender shall be deemed a party to the Ground Lease (but
shall not have any obligations thereunder) for purposes of Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, and shall, provided that, prior to an Event of Default, no such
action by Lender would adversely and materially affect the Borrowers' ability to
prosecute, or defend, any such claims asserted therein, have standing to appear
and act as a party in interest in relation to any matter arising out of or
related to the Ground Lease or such Property.

                  (b)   The Borrowers shall serve Lender with copies of all
notices, pleadings and other documents relating to or affecting the Ground Lease
or the applicable Property. Any notice, pleading or document served by the
Borrowers on any other party in the bankruptcy case shall be contemporaneously
served by such Borrower on Lender, and any notice, pleading or document served
upon or received by such Borrower from any other party in the bankruptcy case
shall be served by such Borrower on Lender promptly upon receipt by such
Borrower.

                  (c)   Upon written request of Lender, the Borrowers shall
assume the Ground Lease, and shall take such steps as are necessary to preserve
such Borrower's right to assume the Ground Lease, including without limitation
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain extensions of time to assume or
reject the Ground Lease under Subsection 365(d) of the Bankruptcy Code to the
extent it is applicable.

      (H)   ASSUMPTION AND ASSIGNMENT. If the Borrowers or the applicable Ground
Lessor seeks to reject any Ground Lease or have the Ground Lease deemed
rejected, then prior to the hearing on such rejection Lender shall, subject to
applicable law, be given no less than twenty (20) days' notice and opportunity
to elect in lieu of rejection to have the Ground Lease assumed and assigned to a
nominee of Lender. If Lender shall so elect to assume and assign the Ground
Lease, then the Borrowers shall, subject to applicable law, continue any request
to reject the Ground Lease until after the motion to assume and assign has been
heard. If Lender shall not elect to assume and assign the Ground Lease, then
Lender may, subject to applicable law, obtain in connection with the rejection
of the Ground Lease a determination that the applicable Ground Lessor, at
Lender's option, shall (1) agree to terminate the Ground Lease and enter into a
new lease with Lender on the same terms and conditions as the Ground Lease, for
the remaining term of the Ground Lease, or (2) treat the Ground Lease as
breached and provide Lender with the rights to cure defaults under the Ground
Lease and to assume the rights and benefits of the Ground Lease.

                                       71
<PAGE>

            Each Borrower shall join with and support any request by Lender to
grant and approve the foregoing as necessary for adequate protection of Lender's
interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender may seek additional terms and
conditions, including such economic and monetary protections as it deems
reasonably appropriate to adequately protect its interests, and any request for
such additional terms or conditions shall not delay or limit Lender's right to
receive the specific elements of adequate protection set forth herein.

            Each Borrower hereby appoints Lender as its attorney in fact to act
on behalf of Lender in connection with all matters relating to or arising out of
the assumption or rejection of any Ground Lease, in which the other party to the
lease is a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code. This grant of power of
attorney is present, unconditional, irrevocable, durable and coupled with an
interest.

SECTION 5.26 CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY.

      (A)   NO MODIFICATION. The Condominium Borrower shall not modify or amend
any material terms of, or terminate any of the Condominium Property Documents,
in each case, without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

      (B)   PERFORMANCE OF CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY DOCUMENTS. The Condominium
Borrower shall fully and faithfully pay when due and payable all assessments,
common charges and other charges payable by the Condominium Borrower under the
Condominium Property Documents and shall perform as and when due each of its
material obligations under the Condominium Property Documents in substantial
accordance with their respective terms, and shall not cause or suffer to occur
any breach or default in any of such obligations. The Condominium Borrower shall
keep and maintain each of the Condominium Property Documents in full force and
effect.

      (C)   NOTICE OF DEFAULT. If the Condominium Borrower shall receive any
written notice of any Condominium Default, the Condominium Borrower immediately
shall notify Lender of same and deliver to Lender a true and complete copy of
each such notice, and provide such documents and information as Lender may
reasonably request concerning such Condominium Default.

      (D)   LENDER'S RIGHT TO CURE. If any Condominium Default shall occur and
be continuing, or if any party to any Condominium Property Document asserts that
a Condominium Default has occurred (whether or not the Borrowers question or
deny such assertion), then, subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Condominium Property Documents, after notice to the Condominium
Borrower, Lender upon five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Borrowers, unless Lender reasonably determines that a shorter period (or no
period) of notice is necessary to protect Lender's interest in the Ground Lease,
may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems reasonably
necessary to cure such Condominium Default, including, without limitation, (i)
performance or attempted performance of the Borrowers' obligations under the
applicable Condominium Property Documents, (ii) curing or attempting to cure any
actual or purported Condominium Default, (iii) mitigating or attempting to
mitigate any damages or consequences of the same and (iv) entry upon the
Condominium

                                       72
<PAGE>

Property for any or all of such purposes. Upon Lender's request, the Condominium
Borrower shall submit satisfactory evidence of payment or performance of any of
its obligations under each of the Condominium Property Documents. Lender may pay
and expend such sums of money as Lender in its sole discretion deems necessary
or desirable for any such purpose, and the Borrowers shall pay to Lender within
five (5) Business Days of the written demand of Lender all such sums so paid or
expended by Lender pursuant to this Section 5.26, together with interest thereon
from the date of expenditure at the Default Rate.

      (E)   PRESERVATION OF CONDOMINIUM. The Condominium Borrower will do all
things necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its material rights, powers
and privileges under the Condominium Property Documents and to prevent the
termination or expiration of the Condominium Property Documents, or the
withdrawal of the Condominium Property from a condominium form of ownership
under applicable law, to the end that the Condominium Borrower may enjoy all of
the material rights granted to it as a party to the Condominium Property
Documents.

      (F)   NOTICE OF CONDOMINIUM DEFAULTS. The Condominium Borrower will (i)
promptly notify Lender of the receipt by the Condominium Borrower of any notice
from the Board of Managers, or the owner of any other unit in the condominium,
covering the Condominium Property, asserting or claiming a default by the
Condominium Borrower thereunder or lack of compliance by the Condominium
Borrower with the Condominium Property Documents, (ii) promptly notify Lender of
the receipt by the Condominium Borrower of any notice or request from the Board
of Managers or owner of any unit of the termination or purported termination of
the Condominium Property Documents or to withdraw the Condominium Property from
condominium ownership pursuant to applicable law or to seek any action for
partition, (iii) promptly notify Lender of the receipt by the Condominium
Borrower of any notice or request from the Board of Managers or owner of any
unit of the material modification or change or proposed material modification or
change of the Condominium Property Documents and (iv) promptly cause a copy of
each such notice of request received by the Condominium Borrower from the Board
of Managers or any unit owner, or from a mortgagee of a mortgage on such other
unit, to be delivered to Lender. The Condominium Borrower will permit Lender to
participate in any such partition or withdrawal proceeding to the extent
permitted by law and the Condominium Property Documents (but Lender shall not be
obligated so to do). The Condominium Borrower will promptly deliver to Lender a
copy of each notice, pleading, brief and preliminary, interim and final
determination or decision and other papers received by it in each such partition
or withdrawal proceeding.

      (G)   STATEMENTS, NOTICES. The Condominium Borrower will, within twenty
(20) days after demand from Lender (which shall not be required more than two
(2) times in any calendar year), obtain, if and to the extent that the
Condominium Borrower is entitled to the same under the Condominium Property
Documents, and otherwise request from and make good faith efforts to obtain,
from the Board of Managers and deliver to Lender a duly signed and acknowledged
certificate (signed also by the Condominium Borrower) that the Condominium
Property Documents are unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if the same
have been modified in compliance with this Loan Agreement, that the Condominium
Property Documents are in full force and effect as to modified and that there
have been no other modifications), stating the dates to which the assessments,
common charges and other charges payable under the Condominium

                                       73
<PAGE>

Property Documents have been paid and stating whether to each certifying party's
knowledge, the Condominium Borrower is in compliance with the Condominium
Property Documents, or, if not, specifying each default or failure of compliance
of which the certifying party has knowledge. The Condominium Borrower will,
promptly upon receipt thereof by the Condominium Borrower, furnish Lender with a

of Managers or relating to the Condominium Property Documents including without
limitation, financial statements and projected budgets.

foregoing expenses then or theretofore incurred and approved by the Borrowers.

SECTION 5.29 CANCELLATION OF INDEBTEDNESS; SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS. Unless

                                    RESERVES

SECTION 6.1 SECURITY INTEREST IN RESERVES; OTHER MATTERS PERTAINING TO RESERVES.

      (A)   The Borrowers hereby pledge, assign and grant to Lender a security
interest in and to all of the Borrowers' right, title and interest in and to the
Account Collateral, including the Reserves, as security for payment and
performance of all of the Obligations hereunder and under the Note and the other
Loan Documents. The Reserves constitute Account Collateral and are subject to
the security interest in favor of Lender created herein and all provisions of
this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents pertaining to Account
Collateral.

      (B)   In addition to the rights and remedies provided in Article VII and
elsewhere herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, Lender shall have all rights and remedies pertaining to the Reserves as
are provided for in any of the Loan Documents or under any applicable law.
Without limiting the foregoing, upon and at all times after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender in its sole and absolute
discretion, may use the Reserves (or any portion thereof) for any purpose,
including but not limited to any combination of the following: (i) payment of
any of the Obligations including the Prepayment Consideration (if any)
applicable upon such payment in such order as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion; provided, however, that such application of funds shall not cure or
be deemed to cure any Default; (ii) reimbursement of Lender for any actual
losses or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred as a result of such Event of Default; (iii) payment for the
work or obligation for which such Reserves were reserved or were required to be
reserved; and (iv) application of the Reserves in connection with the exercise
of any and all rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or
under this Loan Agreement or pursuant to any of the other Loan Documents.
Nothing contained in this Loan Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or
any portion of the funds contained in the Reserves during the continuance of an
Event of Default to payment of the Loan or in any specific order of priority.

SECTION 6.2 FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH LENDER.

      (A)   INTEREST, OFFSETS. Except only as expressly provided otherwise
herein, all funds of the Borrowers which are deposited with Lock Box Account
Bank as Reserves hereunder shall be held by Lock Box Account Bank in one or more
Permitted Investments, such Permitted Investments, prior to an Event of Default,
to be as directed by Borrower. All interest which accrues on the Reserves shall
be taxable to the Borrowers and shall be added to and disbursed in the same
manner and under the same conditions as the principal sum on which said interest
accrued. Additional provisions pertaining to investments are set forth in
Article VII. After repayment of all of the Obligations, all funds held as
Reserves will be promptly returned to, or as directed by, the Borrowers.

      (B)   FUNDING AT CLOSING. The Borrowers shall deposit with Lender the
amounts necessary to fund each of the Reserves as set forth below. Deposits into
the Reserves at Closing may occur by deduction from the amount of the Loan that
otherwise would be disbursed to the Borrowers, followed by deposit of the same
into the applicable Sub-Account or Account of the

                                       75
<PAGE>

Lock Box Account in accordance with the Cash Management Agreement on the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding such deductions, the Loan shall be deemed for all purposes
to be fully disbursed at Closing.

SECTION 6.3 IMPOSITIONS AND INSURANCE RESERVE. On the Closing Date, the
Borrowers shall deposit with Lock Box Account Bank $2,162,828.40 and,
pursuant to the Cash Management Agreement, the Borrowers shall deposit monthly,
on each Payment Date commencing on the Payment date in July 2004, 1/12th of the
annual charges (as reasonably estimated by Lender) for all Impositions and all
Insurance Premiums (other than for D&O Insurance) payable with respect to the
Properties hereunder (said funds, together with any interest thereon and
additions thereto, the "IMPOSITIONS AND INSURANCE RESERVE"). The initial amount
of the monthly deposit to be made to the Impositions and Insurance Reserve from
and after the date hereof is $487,739.18. The Borrowers shall also deposit
with Lock Box Account Bank within ten (10) Business Days of the written demand
by Lender, to be added to and included within such reserve, a sum of money which
Lender reasonably estimates, together with such monthly deposits, will be
sufficient to make the payment of each such charge at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date initially due. The Borrowers shall provide Lender with
bills and all other documents necessary for the payment of the foregoing charges
at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which each payment shall first
become subject to penalty or interest if not paid. So long as (i) no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the Borrowers have provided Lender
with the foregoing bills and other documents in a timely manner, and (iii)
sufficient funds are held by Lender for the payment of the Impositions and
Insurance Premiums relating to each of the Properties, Lender shall pay said
items or disburse to the Borrowers from such Reserve an amount sufficient to pay
said items. Interest shall accrue in favor of the Borrowers on funds in the
Impositions and Insurance Reserve and be added to the balance thereof and
disbursed in accordance with the terms hereof.

SECTION 6.4 FF&E RESERVE. On or prior to the Closing Date, Lender or Servicer on
behalf of Lender shall establish and maintain with Lock Box Bank an account for
the purpose of creating a reserve for replacements of FF&E at or in, or used in
connection with, the Properties (the "REPLACEMENTS") in accordance with the
applicable CapEx/FF&E Budget approved by Lender (said funds, together with any
interest thereon and additions thereto, the "FF&E RESERVE"). The FF&E Reserve
shall be held in an Eligible Account entitled "FF&E Reserve Account for the
benefit of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as secured party" which account
shall be under the sole dominion and control of Lender, subject to the terms of
the Cash Management Agreement. Pursuant to the Cash Management Agreement, the
Borrowers shall deposit monthly, on each Payment Date commencing with the
Payment Date in July 2004, an amount equal to 4.0% of the Operating Revenues
generated from the Properties for the prior calendar month (such amount, the
"MONTHLY FF&E PAYMENT"). Funds held in the FF&E Reserve may be withdrawn by the
Borrowers, subject in all instances to the terms of the Cash Management
Agreement, only in accordance with the approved CapEx/FF&E Budget, and no funds
held in the FF&E Reserve shall be used in connection with the Required Capital
Improvements. Upon and at all times after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, no draws will be permitted from the FF&E
Reserve other than for Replacements subject, in each instance, to Manager's
compliance with the FF&E reporting requirements set forth in Section
5.1(A)(v)(d).

                                       76
<PAGE>
 SECTION 6.5 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE; REQUIRED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. At
Closing, the Borrowers shall deposit with Lock Box Account Bank $16,019,622.00
(said funds, together with any interest thereon, the "CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT
RESERVE"), which funds shall be made available to the Borrowers solely for
payment of certain Capital Improvements required to be made to the Properties
and designated as "Required Capital Improvements" on SCHEDULE 6.5 attached
hereto (the "REQUIRED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS") and shall not be used by the
Borrowers for purposes for which any other Reserve is established or for any
other purpose other than completion of the Required Capital Improvements. The
Borrowers shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute to completion,
subject to Force Majeure, the Required Capital Improvements within the time
periods for each Required Capital Improvement set forth on EXHIBIT A. Funds held
in the Capital Improvement Reserve shall be disbursed in accordance with Section
6.7. Subject to the foregoing conditions, but also subject to the last paragraph
of Section 11.4, the Borrowers shall be entitled to draw any remaining balance
in the Capital Improvement Reserve when all Required Capital Improvements are
complete, and paid for, in accordance with the terms hereof.

SECTION 6.6 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REMEDIATION RESERVE. At Closing, the Borrowers
shall deposit with Lock Box Account Bank, an amount equal to $21,368.75 (said
funds, together with any interest thereon and additions thereto, the "HAZARDOUS
MATERIALS REMEDIATION RESERVE") for certain work related to Hazardous Materials
on the Properties as indicated in the Environmental Reports for the Properties
prepared and delivered prior to the Closing and as such work is more
particularly described on SCHEDULE 6.6 (the "ENVIRONMENTAL WORK"). Prior to the
earlier of (x) the date required by any applicable Governmental Authority or (y)
nine (9) months after the Closing, the Borrowers shall, subject to Force
Majeure, complete such Environmental Work and shall provide to Lender such
closure reports, no-further-action letters, or other evidence of compliance with
law as Lender may reasonably require. The funds contained in the Hazardous
Materials Remediation Reserve shall be utilized by the Borrowers solely for
performance of the Environmental Work in accordance with the Environmental
Reports, and shall not be used by the Borrowers for purposes for which any other
Reserve is established. Subject to the Borrowers' satisfaction of the applicable
conditions of Section 6.7, the Borrowers shall be entitled to draw upon the
Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve to pay for costs that have been incurred
by the Borrowers for such Environmental Work, provided that the Borrowers
deliver to Lender such evidence as may be reasonably satisfactory to Lender
that, after payment of such draw, the funds remaining in the Hazardous Materials
Remediation Reserve shall be sufficient to pay for the remainder of such
Environmental Work. Subject to the foregoing conditions, but also subject to the
last paragraph of Section 11.4, the Borrowers shall be entitled to draw any
remaining balance in the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve when all such
Environmental Work is complete, and is paid for, in accordance with the terms
hereof.

SECTION 6.7 CONDITIONS TO DISBURSEMENTS FROM HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REMEDIATION
RESERVE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE; PERFORMANCE OF WORK.

      (A)   DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REMEDIATION RESERVE AND
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE. Upon the Borrowers' written request for
disbursement, Lender shall authorize Lock Box Account Bank to disburse funds to
or for the account of the Borrowers (x) from the Hazardous Materials Remediation
Reserve, to pay to, or pay on behalf of, the

                                       77
<PAGE>

Borrowers for the amount of the Borrowers' actual bona fide out-of-pocket
expenditures or costs incurred for Environmental Work (the "APPROVED
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES", and (y) from the Capital Improvement Reserve, to
pay to, or pay on behalf of, the Borrowers for the amount of the Borrowers'
actual bona fide out-of-pocket expenditures or costs incurred for Required
Capital Improvements ("APPROVED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT EXPENDITURES"; and together
with the Approved Environmental Expenditures, collectively, "APPROVED
EXPENDITURES"; and the related Environmental Work or Required Capital
Improvements to which any such request for disbursement relates shall be
referred to as the "WORK"), upon satisfaction of each of the conditions listed
on SCHEDULE 6.7 and each of the conditions set forth below in Lender's
reasonable discretion:

            (i)   Except as provided in this Section 6.7, each request for
disbursement from the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve or the Capital
Improvement Reserve (such Reserves, the "WORK RESERVES") shall be made for
completion of the Approved Expenditures for which disbursement is requested.

            (ii)  A request for disbursement from the Work Reserves may be made
after completion of a portion of the work under such contract, or for payment of
deposits required in connection with the Work under such contract, provided (1)
all other conditions in this Loan Agreement for disbursement have been
satisfied, (2) funds remaining in the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve
are, in Lender's reasonable judgment, sufficient to complete the Environmental
Work when required and/or funds remaining in the Capital Improvement Reserve
are, in Lender's reasonable judgment, sufficient to complete such item of
Required Capital Improvements and any other Required Capital Improvements
remaining to be performed, as the case may be, and (3) if reasonably required by
Lender, each contractor or subcontractor receiving payments in excess of
$100,000 under such contract shall provide a waiver of lien with respect to
amounts which have been paid to that contractor or subcontractor.

            (iii) To the extent the contract with the relevant contractor or
supplier provides for a retainage, each disbursement from a Work Reserve, except
for a final disbursement, shall be in the amount of actual costs incurred less
the percentage of such costs that the contract with the relevant contractor or
supplier specifies to be retained and advanced as part of the final
disbursement. No funds will be advanced for materials stored at any Property
unless such materials are properly stored and secured at the applicable Property
in accordance with the Borrowers' customary procedures and sound construction
practices as reasonably determined by Lender. No funds will be advanced for
materials stored at any location other than at the Properties unless Lender
determines in its reasonable discretion that Lender has a perfected first
priority security interest in any such materials.

            (iv)  The amount of all invoices in connection with the Work with
respect to which a disbursement is requested and which has been approved by
Lender shall be disbursed by Lock Box Account Bank as directed by the Borrowers
(in which event, the Borrowers covenant and agree to promptly pay such invoices)
or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at Lender's option
and in Lender's sole and absolute discretion, directly to the contractor,
supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor indicated on said invoices
unless already paid by the Borrowers and Lender has received satisfactory
evidence of such payment in which case Lender shall reimburse the Borrowers. All
invoices in connection with

                                       78
<PAGE>

disbursements from the Capital Improvement Reserve shall be classified as
requests for payment for items of Capital Improvement (as opposed to items that,
in conformity with GAAP, would be included as Operating Expenses). If the
Borrowers request that any amounts be disbursed directly to the Borrowers
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the Borrowers shall be required to deliver
evidence reasonably acceptable to Lender of payment of all invoices for which
disbursements were previously made to the Borrowers as a condition to such
requested disbursement.

            (v)   No more than two (2) disbursements will be made by Lender from
the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve or the Capital Improvement Reserve
in any calendar month, and, if made in accordance herewith or otherwise approved
by Lender, requested disbursements will be made within five (5) Business Days
after the request therefor. Lender shall not be required to make any
disbursement from a Work Reserve with respect to the Property unless such
requested disbursement is in an amount equal to or greater than $25,000 (other
than the final disbursement).

            (vi)  Lender reserves the right, at its option and as a condition to
any disbursement from a Work Reserve, to approve (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (i) all drawings and plans and
specifications, if any, for any Work which require aggregate payments in amounts
exceeding the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the Aggregate Allocated Loan
Amount with respect to the applicable Property or (y) $250,000, and (ii) all
contracts and work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers,
subcontractors, contractors and other parties providing labor or materials in
connection with any Work which require aggregate payments in amounts exceeding
the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the Aggregate Allocated Loan Amount with
respect to the applicable Property or (y) $250,000. Upon Lender's reasonable
request, the Borrowers shall assign (to the extent assignable) any drawings,
plans and specifications, contracts or subcontracts to Lender. Drawings, plans
and specifications, contracts and work orders approved by Lender shall not be
changed in any material respect without Lender's prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

            (vii) The Borrowers shall have delivered a certificate to Lender
from an Architect certifying that the Work has been completed in a good and
workmanlike manner in accordance with all applicable laws for any item in excess
of the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the Aggregate Allocated Loan Amount
with respect to the applicable Property or (y) $250,000. Lender may retain its
own architect or engineer ("LENDER'S CONSULTANT") to review any plans and
specifications for any item in excess of the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of
the Aggregate Allocated Loan Amount with respect to the applicable Property or
(y) $250,000, and to periodically inspect any Work at the Borrowers' sole cost
and expense.

            (viii) The Borrowers shall have delivered to Lender a certificate of
the Borrowers (substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT L)
certifying as to the actual costs which were incurred by the Borrowers to
complete such Work, which costs shall not materially exceed the amount budgeted
for such Work under the CapEx/FF&E Budget then in effect unless approved by
Lender, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned
(together with supporting documentation reasonably acceptable to Lender).

                                       79
<PAGE>

            (ix)  The Borrowers shall have delivered to Lender all necessary
material certificates, authorizations, permits and licenses which are required
to permit the construction and completion of the Work, as issued by the
appropriate Governmental Authority. The Borrowers, to the full extent permitted
by applicable law, hereby assigns to Lender as additional security for the
payment of the Obligations and the observance and performance by the Borrowers
of the terms, covenants and provisions of the Loan Documents all right, title
and interest which the Borrowers may now have or may hereafter acquire in and to
such certificates, authorizations, permits and licenses.

            (x)   Lender may require an inspection of the Property prior to
making a monthly disbursement from the applicable Work Reserve in order to
verify completion of the Work for which disbursement is sought in excess of the
greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the Aggregate Allocated Loan Amount with
respect to the applicable Property or (y) $250,000. Lender may require that such
inspection be conducted by Lender's Consultant and/or may require a copy of a
certificate of completion by an independent qualified architect or engineer
acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of any amounts from the
applicable Work Reserve. The Borrowers shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket
expense of such inspections as reasonably required hereunder, whether such
inspections are conducted by Lender, Servicer, Lender's Consultant or by an
independent qualified professional.

      (B)   PERFORMANCE OF WORK.

            (i)   The Borrowers shall complete all Work in a good and
workmanlike manner as soon as practicable following the commencement thereof
substantially in accordance with the applicable budget approved by Lender in
accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement. The insufficiency of the
balance in the applicable Work Reserve shall not relieve the Borrowers from
their obligations to perform and complete the related Work as herein provided or
to fulfill all other preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan
Documents.

            (ii)  If Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that any
Work is not being performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that any Work
has not been completed in a workmanlike manner, Lender shall have the option to
withhold disbursement for such unsatisfactory work and so notify the Borrowers
with reasonable detail regarding the basis for Lender's dissatisfaction and,
after the expiration of forty-five (45) days from the giving of such notice by
Lender to the Borrowers of such unsatisfactory work without the cure thereof
(or, if such unsatisfactory work is susceptible of a cure but cannot reasonably
be cured within said forty-five (45) day period and provided that the Borrowers
shall have commenced to cure such unsatisfactory work within said forty-five
(45) day period and thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the
same, after the expiration of such longer period as is reasonably necessary for
the Borrowers in the exercise of due diligence to cure such unsatisfactory work,
up to a maximum of an additional sixty (60) days, subject to Force Majeure,
without the cure thereof), Lender may proceed under existing contracts or
contract with third parties to complete such Work, as the case may be, and apply
amounts contained in the applicable Work Reserve toward the labor and materials
necessary to complete the same, without providing any additional prior notice to
the Borrowers, and exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender upon
and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder.

                                       80
<PAGE>

            (iii) In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making of any
Work pursuant to Section 6.7(B)(ii) above, the Borrowers grant Lender the right
to enter onto each Property during normal business hours after the expiration of
the notice specified above and perform, subject to the rights of tenants, any
and all work and labor necessary to complete the applicable Work and/or employ
watchmen to protect the Property from damage. All sums so expended by Lender
shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to the Borrowers and
secured by the applicable Mortgage. For this purpose, the Borrowers constitute
and appoint Lender their true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution to complete or undertake the applicable Work in the name of the
Borrowers pursuant to Section 6.7(B)(ii) above. Such power of attorney shall be
deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrowers
empower said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any funds in the applicable
Work Reserve for the purpose of making or completing any Work; (ii) to make such
additions, changes and corrections to any Work as shall be reasonably necessary
or desirable to complete the same; (iii) to employ such contractors,
subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be required for such
purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which
are or may become Liens against any Property, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of any Work, or for clearance of title; (v) to
execute all applications and certificates in the name of the Borrowers which may
be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) in its reasonable discretion,
to prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with any
Property or the rehabilitation and repair of such Property; and (vii) to do any
and every act which the Borrowers might do in their own behalf to fulfill the
terms of this Loan Agreement.

            (iv)  Nothing in this Section shall: (i) make Lender responsible for
making or completing any Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds in addition
to the amounts on deposit in the applicable Work Reserve to make or complete any
Work; (iii) obligate Lender to proceed with any Work; or (iv) obligate Lender to
demand from the Borrowers additional sums to make or complete any Work.

            (v)   The Borrowers shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect or
inspector) or third parties performing any Work pursuant to this Section 6.7 to
enter onto any Property during normal business hours upon reasonable notice
(subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of
any Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all
plans and shop drawings relating thereto which are or may be kept at any
Property, and to complete any Work made pursuant to Section 6.7(B)(ii). The
Borrowers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all contractors and
subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or Lender's representatives or such
other persons described above in connection with inspections described in this
Section 6.7(B) or the completion of the Work pursuant to this Section 6.7(B).

            (vi)  All Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures and any other
item comprising a part thereof shall be constructed, installed or completed, as
applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialman's or other liens
(except for the Permitted Encumbrances).

            (vii) All Work shall comply with all applicable legal requirements
of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the Properties and
applicable insurance

                                       81
<PAGE>

requirements, including, without limitation, applicable building codes, special
use permits, environmental regulations and requirements of insurance
underwriters.

      (C) INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrowers shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender
harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands,
liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) arising from or in any way connected with the performance of the
Work, except to the extent caused by the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross
negligence of Lender. The Borrowers shall assign to Lender all rights and claims
the Borrowers may have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in
connection with the Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such
right or claim or pursue any other action with respect to such rights and claims
unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

SECTION 6.8 CASH TRAP RESERVE. (i) If, at any time prior to the repayment of the
Obligations in full, a Cash Trap Event shall occur, then for so long as such
Cash Trap Event continues to exist, all Excess Cash Flow (except as otherwise
expressly provided below) shall be deposited with Lender (or its Servicer or
agent) and held in the Lock Box Account in accordance with the terms of the Cash
Management Agreement (said funds, together with any interest thereon, the "CASH
TRAP RESERVE"). A "CASH TRAP EVENT" shall occur as of any Calculation Date when
(x) the Debt Yield is less than the Minimum Debt Yield or (y) during the Second
Extension Term or Third Extension Term, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio is less
than the Minimum DSCR, in each case for the trailing twelve (12) month period
ending on such Calculation Date and shall continue to exist until such time as
the Minimum Debt Yield and, during the Second Extension Term or Third Extension
Term, the Minimum DSCR tests have been satisfied for three (3) consecutive
Calculation Dates (on a trailing twelve (12) month basis) following the
commencement of the applicable Cash Trap Event. Notwithstanding that the Debt
Yield is less than the Minimum Debt Yield or, if applicable, the Debt Service
Coverage Ratio is less than the Minimum DSCR as of any Calculation Date, no Cash
Trap Event shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of such event if the
Borrowers make a principal prepayment of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal
Balance (which prepayment amount shall be disbursed on the next Payment Date in
accordance with the terms of the Cash Management Agreement), within three (3)
Business Days after the date of delivery of the financial statements disclosing
the existence of such Cash Trap Event (or the date on which such financial
statements are required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.1), in an amount
equal to the greater of (x) one percent (1%) of the Aggregate Outstanding
Principal Balance, or (y) 120% of the amount, as determined by Lender in its
reasonable discretion, sufficient to cause the Debt Yield to meet or exceed the
Minimum Debt Yield and, if applicable, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio to meet
or exceed the Minimum DSCR if such calculations were recalculated as provided
above assuming that such amount was applied to reduce the Aggregate Outstanding
Principal Balance as of the first day of the relevant measuring period. During
the continuance of a Cash Trap Event, provided that no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, any funds on deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve
may, at the Borrowers' election, be retained in the Cash Trap Reserve or may be
applied to (i) prepayment of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance as
provided above, (ii) Capital Expenditures reasonably approved by Lender, or
(iii) scheduled payments (not to exceed $900,000 in the aggregate) of principal
and interest under the Loan and the Mezzanine Loan (to be applied in accordance
with the terms of the Cash Management Agreement). Any funds on

                                       82
<PAGE>

deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve shall continue to be held as additional
Collateral in accordance with this Section 6.8 until the earlier of (a) the date
that such funds are applied or disbursed pursuant to the foregoing sentence or
(b) the date that the Minimum Debt Yield and, during the Second Extension Term
or Third Extension Term, the Minimum DSCR tests have each been satisfied for
three (3) consecutive months (as determined above), at which time, provided no
Event of Default exists, and no Cash Trap Event has commenced, such funds,
together with any and all amounts then held in the Minimum Balance Sub-Account
(as defined in the Cash Management Agreement), shall be automatically released
to the Borrowers without any further certification requirements on the part of
the Borrowers. The existence of a Cash Trap Event shall be determined by Lender
in its reasonable good faith determination. If Lender determines that a Cash
Trap Event has occurred, Lender shall send the Borrowers written notice thereof.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, all funds on deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve and
any subsequent Excess Cash Flow, while such Event of Default is continuing, may
be applied by Lender to payment of the Loan (including payment of any Prepayment
Consideration) or other Obligations (or to the obligations of the Mezzanine
Borrowers to Mezzanine Lender) as Lender may elect.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                       DEPOSIT ACCOUNT; LOCK BOX ACCOUNT;
                                 CASH MANAGEMENT

SECTION 7.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AND LOCK BOX ACCOUNT.

      (A) (i) DEPOSIT ACCOUNT. On or before the Closing Date, one or more
deposit accounts shall be established at the Borrowers' sole cost and expense in
the name of Lender, as secured party hereunder (said accounts, and any accounts
replacing same in accordance with this Loan Agreement and the Deposit Account
Agreement, collectively, the "DEPOSIT ACCOUNT") with one or more financial
institutions reasonably approved by Lender (collectively, the "DEPOSIT BANK"),
pursuant to one or more agreements (collectively, the "DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
AGREEMENT") substantially similar to Lender's form or otherwise in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Lender, executed and delivered by the
Borrowers and the Deposit Bank. The Deposit Account shall be under the sole
dominion and control of Lender (which dominion and control may be exercised by
Servicer). Among other things, the Deposit Account Agreement shall provide that
the Borrowers shall have no access to or control over the Deposit Account, that
all available funds on deposit in the Deposit Account shall be transferred by
wire transfer (or transfer via the ACH System) on each Business Day by the
Deposit Bank into the Lock Box Account, for application in accordance with the
Cash Management Agreement. The Deposit Bank and the Lock Box Account Bank shall
be directed to deliver to the Borrowers copies of bank statements and other
information made available by the Deposit Bank and the Lock Box Account Bank
concerning the Deposit Account and the Lock Box Account.

            (ii) Upon establishing the Deposit Account, (1) the Borrowers shall
cause any and all Operating Revenues, including distributions or other payments
made directly or indirectly to the Borrowers, Manager, or any of their
respective Affiliates, from any Beverage Company, to be deposited promptly into
the Deposit Account and in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the
same are paid to or for the benefit of the Borrowers, and (2) the Borrowers
shall obtain agreements (each, a "CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES PAYMENT DIRECTION
LETTER") from each of the

                                       83
<PAGE>

Persons paying or disbursing credit card receivables (the "CREDIT CARD
COMPANIES"), substantially similar to Lender's form or otherwise in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Lender, pursuant to which the Credit Card
Companies agree to pay all credit card receivables into the Lock Box Account,
and acknowledge and agree that Lender shall have a first priority perfected
security interest in such credit card receivables. To the extent that the
Borrowers or any Person on the Borrowers' behalf holds any Receipts, whether in
accordance with this Loan Agreement or otherwise, the Borrowers shall be deemed
to hold the same in trust for Lender for the protection of the interests of
Lender hereunder and under the Loan Documents. The Borrowers represent and
warrant that, as of the date hereof, the only Credit Card Companies paying or
disbursing credit card receivables with respect to the Property are Chase
Merchant Services, American Express, Discover Financial Service, Diners Club,
JCB (Japanese Credit Bureau), and, if any of the Borrowers shall hereafter enter
into an agreement with any other Credit Card Company pursuant to which such
Credit Card Company shall pay credit card receivables with respect to the
Properties, such Borrower shall promptly obtain a Credit Card Receivables
Payment Direction Letter in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender
from such Credit Card Company.

            (ii) The Borrowers shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the transactions and other

reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and all reasonable fees and expenses of
the Deposit Bank and the Lock Box Account Bank, including without limitation
their reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.

      (B) LOCK BOX ACCOUNT. On or before the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms
of the Cash Management Agreement, an Eligible Account shall be established in
the name of Lender, as secured party hereunder, to serve as the "Lock Box

this Loan Agreement and the Cash Management Agreement, the "LOCK BOX ACCOUNT";

Default. Lender may elect to change any financial institution in which the Lock
Box Account shall be maintained if such institution is no longer an Eligible
Bank, upon not less than five (5) Business Days' notice to the Borrower. The
Lock Box Account shall be deemed to contain such sub-accounts as Lender may
designate ("SUB-ACCOUNTS"), which may be maintained as separate ledger accounts
and need not be separate Eligible Accounts. The Sub-Accounts shall include the
following as more particularly described in the Cash Management Agreement:

            (i) "DEBT SERVICE SUB-ACCOUNT" means the Sub-Account of the Lock Box
Account established for the purposes of reserving for payments of principal and
interest and other amounts due under the Loan Documents (but without duplication
of amounts covered under item (ii) below); and

            (ii) "RESERVE SUB-ACCOUNTS" means the Sub-Accounts of the Lock Box
Account established for the purpose of holding funds in the Reserves including:

Reserve Sub-Account"; (c) the "Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve
Sub-Account"; (d) the "Extraordinary Receipts Sub-Account" (e) the "Mezzanine
Loan Debt Service Sub-Account"; (f) the "Minimum Balance Sub-Account" and (g)

Account shall be allocated to the Sub-Accounts or the other Accounts (or paid,
as the case may be) in accordance with the Cash Management Agreement.

SECTION 7.3 APPLICATION OF FUNDS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section or elsewhere, Lender shall have all rights and remedies available
under applicable law and under the Loan Documents. Without limitation of the
foregoing, for so long as an Event of Default exists, Lender may apply any and
all funds in the Deposit Account, and/or any Sub-Accounts against all or any
portion of any of the Obligations, in any order.

Lien under Section 5.18 or 11.1, the same shall not constitute an Event of
Default if (i) within forty-five (45) days after the filing thereof, the

bonding or otherwise, or (ii) same is being contested in good faith in
accordance with Section 5.3(B) hereof); or

<PAGE>

connection with any Loan Document is false in any material respect as of the
date made; or

      (F) OTHER DEFAULTS UNDER LOAN DOCUMENTS. A default shall occur in the
performance of or compliance with any term contained in this Loan Agreement or
the other Loan Documents and such default is not fully cured within thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Borrowers of written notice from Lender of such
default (other than occurrences described in other provisions of this Section
8.1 for which a different grace or cure period is specified or which constitute
immediate Events of Default); provided however that if (i) the default is
capable of cure but with diligence cannot be cured within such period of thirty
(30) days, (ii) the Borrowers (or the applicable Borrower Party) has commenced
the cure within such thirty (30) day period and has pursued such cure
diligently, and (iii) each Borrower delivers to Lender promptly following
written demand (which demand may be made from time to time by Lender) evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Lender of the foregoing, then such period shall be
extended for so long as is reasonably necessary for the Borrowers in the
exercise of due diligence to cure such default, but in no event beyond one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the original notice of default; or

      (G) INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY; APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER, ETC. (i) A court

described in either of Subsections 8.1(G) or 8.1(H), all or any portion of the
Collateral becomes property of the estate or subject to the automatic stay in
any case or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable bankruptcy,

an Event of Default if it is dismissed or discharged within ninety (90) days

<PAGE>

      (J) SOLVENCY. Any Borrower Party ceases to be solvent or admits in writing
its present or prospective inability to pay its debts as they become due; or

      (K) JUDGMENT AND ATTACHMENTS. Any lien, money judgment, writ or warrant of
attachment, or similar process is entered or filed against any Borrower Party or
any of its assets, which claim is not fully covered by insurance (other than

Borrowers or any Lien securing the Obligations shall, in whole or in part, cease
to be a perfected first priority Lien, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances
(except in any of the foregoing cases in accordance with the terms hereof or
under any other Loan Document) and the Borrowers do not take all actions
requested by Lender to correct such defect within ten (10) days after the
written request by Lender to take such action, or any Person under the control
of the Borrowers or Guarantor who is a party thereto, other than Lender, denies
that it has any further liability (as distinguished from denial of the existence
of a Default or Event of Default) under any Loan Documents to which it is party,
or gives notice to such effect; or

      (N) CROSS-DEFAULT WITH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. A default beyond any
applicable grace periods shall occur under any of the other Loan Documents; or

      (O) DEFAULT UNDER MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS OR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. (i) An

Agreements, and such breach or default either is of such a nature or continues
for such a period of time beyond applicable notice and cure periods, if any,
that Manager shall have the right to exercise material remedies as a consequence
thereof; or

      (P) GROUND LEASE/CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY. Any default by any of the Borrowers

Document without Lender's prior written consent.

            If more than one of the foregoing paragraphs shall describe the same
condition or event, then Lender shall have the right to select which paragraph
or paragraphs shall apply. In any such case, Lender shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to designate the paragraph or paragraphs which provide for
non-written notice (or for no notice) or for a shorter time to cure (or for no
time to cure).

                                       87

SECTION 8.2 ACCELERATION AND REMEDIES.

      (A) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default
described in any of Subsections 8.1(G), 8.1(H), or 8.1(I), the unpaid principal
amount of and accrued interest and fees on the Loan and all other Obligations
shall automatically become immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or other
requirements of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrowers. Upon and at any time after the occurrence of any other Event of
Default, at the option of Lender, which may be exercised without notice or
demand to anyone, all or any portion of the Loan and other Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable.

      (B) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
all or any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies
available to Lender against the Borrowers under this Loan Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, or at law or in equity, may be exercised by Lender at
any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Obligations
shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have
commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its
rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to the
Properties. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent
and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise,
at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its sole discretion,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting
the other rights and remedies of Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or
as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default is continuing (i) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, Lender shall not be subject to any "one action"
or "election of remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights,
remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect
until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against each Property and the
Mortgages have been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Obligations or the Obligations have been paid in full.

      (C) Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose
the Mortgages in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Mortgages then
due and payable as determined by Lender in its sole discretion including,
without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event the Borrowers
default beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more
scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose the Mortgage
to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event Lender elects to
accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loan,
Lender may foreclose the Mortgage or any of them to recover so much of the
principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums
secured by the Mortgage as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial
foreclosures, the Property shall remain subject to the Mortgage to secure
payment of sums secured by the Mortgage and not previously recovered.

      (D) During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have the
right from time to time to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one
or more separate notes, mortgages and other security documents in such
denominations as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of
evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided

                                       88
<PAGE>

hereunder. The Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to time,
within ten (10) days after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such
other documents as Lender shall reasonably request in order to effect the
severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Lender. The Borrowers hereby absolutely and
irrevocably appoint Lender as their true and lawful attorney, coupled with an
interest, in their name and stead to make and execute all documents reasonably
necessary to effect the aforesaid severance if the Borrowers fail to do so
within ten (10) days of Lender's written request, the Borrowers ratifying all
that their said attorney shall do by virtue thereof.

      (E) Any amounts recovered from the Properties or any other collateral for
the Loan after an Event of Default may be applied by Lender toward the payment
of any interest and/or principal of the Loan and/or any other amounts due under
the Loan Documents in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole
discretion shall determine.

      (F) The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Loan Agreement
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which
Lender may have against the Borrowers pursuant to this Loan Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's
rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singly, concurrently or otherwise, at
such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion.
No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an
Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be
construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be
exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of
one Default or Event of Default with respect to the Borrowers shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by the
Borrowers or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

SECTION 8.3 PERFORMANCE BY LENDER.

      (A) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
if any of the Borrowers shall fail to perform, or cause to be performed, any
material covenant, duty or agreement contained in any of the Loan Documents
(subject to applicable notice and cure periods), Lender may perform or attempt
to perform such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of the Borrowers including
making protective advances on behalf of any Borrower, or, in its sole
discretion, causing the obligations of any of the Borrowers to be satisfied with
the proceeds of any Reserve. In such event, the Borrowers shall, at the request
of Lender, promptly pay to Lender, or reimburse, as applicable, any of the
Reserves, any actual amount reasonably expended or disbursed by Lender in such
performance or attempted performance, together with interest thereon at the
Default Rate (including reimbursement of any applicable Reserves), from the date
of such expenditure or disbursement, until paid. Any amounts advanced or
expended by Lender to perform or attempt to perform any such matter shall be
added to and included within the indebtedness evidenced by the applicable Note
and shall be secured by all of the Collateral securing the applicable Loan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly agreed that Lender shall not have
any liability or responsibility for the performance of any obligation of the
Borrowers under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, and it is
further expressly agreed that no such performance by Lender shall cure any Event
of Default hereunder.

                                       89
<PAGE>

      (B) Lender may cease or suspend any and all performance required of Lender
under the Loan Documents upon and at any time after the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default.

SECTION 8.4 EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE. Promptly following request by Lender, each
Borrower shall provide such documents and instruments as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Lender to evidence compliance with any material provision of the
Loan Documents applicable to the Borrowers.

                                   ARTICLE X
                RESTRUCTURING LOAN, SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS

SECTION 10.1 SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY. Lender shall have the
right to engage in one or more Secondary Market Transactions with respect to the
Loan, and to structure and restructure all or any part of the Loan, including
without limitation in multiple tranches, as a wraparound loan, or for inclusion
in a REMIC or other Securitization. Without limitation, Lender shall have the
right, at Lender's sole cost (other than each Borrower's internal costs and
expenses and the costs and expenses of the Borrowers' counsel), to cause the
Note and any Mortgage to be split into a first and a second mortgage loan, or
into one or more loans evidenced by multiple notes and secured by multiple
mortgages and/or by ownership interests in any of the Borrowers in whatever
proportion Lender determines, and thereafter to engage in Secondary Market
Transactions with respect to all or any part of the indebtedness and loan
documentation. Each of the Borrower Parties acknowledge that it is the intention
of the parties that all or a portion of the Loan will be securitized and that
all or a portion of the Loan will be rated by one or more Rating Agencies. Each
of the Borrower Parties further acknowledge that additional structural
modifications may be required to satisfy issues raised by any Rating Agencies.
As used herein, "SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTION" means any of (i) the sale,
assignment, or other transfer of all or any portion of the Obligations or the
Loan Documents or any interest therein to one or more investors, (ii) the sale,
assignment, or other transfer of one or more participation interests in the
Obligations or Loan Documents to one or more investors, (iii) the transfer or
deposit of all or any portion of the Obligations or Loan Documents to or with
one or more trusts or other entities which may sell certificates or other
instruments to investors evidencing an ownership interest in the assets of such
trust or the right to receive income or proceeds therefrom or (iv) any other
Securitization backed in whole or in part by the Loan or any interest therein.

SECTION 10.2 COOPERATION; LIMITATIONS. The Borrower Parties shall use all
reasonable efforts and cooperate reasonably and in good faith with Lender in
effecting any such restructuring or Secondary Market Transactions at Lender's
sole cost (other than, with respect to the first successful Securitization and
any related Secondary Market Transaction only (or if the Loan shall be hereafter
split into multiple loans, the first successful Securitization and any related
Secondary Market Transaction with respect to each of such loans), the Borrowers'
internal costs and expenses and the costs and expenses of the Borrower Parties'
counsel). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this Article X, it is acknowledged and agreed that in no event shall Lender be
responsible for payment of any Borrower Party's (or its Affiliate's) internal
costs and expenses in connection with any Secondary Market Transaction.

                                       94
<PAGE>

Such cooperation shall include without limitation, executing and delivering such
reasonable amendments to the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of
each Borrower as Lender or any Interested Party (as defined below) may request,
provided however that, no such amendment shall modify (i) the weighted average
interest rate payable under the Note (or notes); (ii) the stated maturity date
of the Note, (iii) the amortization of the principal amount of the Note, (iv)
any other material economic terms of the Obligations, (v) the non-recourse
provisions of the Loan or (vi) any provision, the effect of which would increase
the Borrowers' obligations or decrease the Borrowers' rights under the Loan
Documents except to a de minimis extent. The Borrower Parties shall not be
required to provide additional collateral to effect any such restructuring or
Secondary Market Transaction after the Closing Date. The Borrower Parties shall
not be required to pay any third party (other than, which respect to the first
successful Securitization and any related Secondary Market Transaction only (or
if the Loan shall be hereafter split into multiple loans, the first successful
Securitization and any related Secondary Market Transaction with respect to each
of such loans), the costs and expenses of the Borrowers' counsel) costs and
expenses incurred by Lender in connection with any such Secondary Market
Transaction unless otherwise expressly payable by the Borrower Parties under
this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 10.3 INFORMATION. The Borrower Parties, at Lender's cost and expense
(other than, with respect to the first successful Securitization and any related
Secondary Market Transaction only (or if the Loan shall be hereafter split into
multiple loans, the first successful Securitization and any related Secondary
Market Transaction with respect to each of such loans), the Borrowers' internal
costs and expenses and the costs and expenses of the Borrower Parties' counsel),
shall provide such access to personnel and such information and documents
relating to the Borrower Parties, Manager, the Properties and Collateral and the
business and operations of all of the foregoing and such opinions of counsel
(including nonconsolidation opinions) as any Rating Agency may request or as
Lender or any other Interested Party may reasonably request in connection with
any such Secondary Market Transaction including, without limitation, updated
financial information, appraisals, market studies, environmental reviews (Phase
I's and, if appropriate, Phase II's), mold inspection, property condition
reports and other due diligence investigations together with appropriate
verification of such updated information and reports through letters of auditors
and consultants and, as of the closing date of the Secondary Market Transaction,
updated representations and warranties made in the Loan Documents and such
additional representations and warranties as any Rating Agency may request or
any purchaser, transferee, assignee, trustee, servicer or potential investor
(the Rating Agencies and all of the foregoing parties, collectively, "INTERESTED
PARTIES") may reasonably request, to the extent such updated representations and
warranties are true. On or prior to the date of closing of any Secondary Market
Transaction, the Borrowers, at Lender's cost and expense (other than with
respect to the first successful Securitization and any related Secondary Market
Transaction only (or if the Loan shall be hereafter split into multiple loans,
the first successful Securitization and any related Secondary Market Transaction
with respect to each of such loans), the Borrowers' internal costs and expenses
and the costs and expenses of the Borrowers' counsel), shall, if required by any
Rating Agency or reasonably required by Lender, provide revisions or
"bringdowns" to any opinions delivered at Closing (including nonconsolidation
opinions), or if required by the Rating Agencies, new versions of such opinions,
which opinions shall be consistent in substance with the opinions covered by the
original opinions, addressed to Lender, any trustee under any Securitization
backed in whole or in part by the Loan, any Rating Agency

                                       95

that assigns a rating to any securities in connection therewith and any investor
purchasing securities therein. Lender shall be permitted to share all such
information with the investment banking firms, Rating Agencies, accounting
firms, law firms, other third party advisory firms, potential investors,
servicers and other service providers and other parties directly involved in any
proposed Secondary Market Transaction. The Borrowers understand that any such
information may be incorporated into any offering circular, prospectus,
prospectus supplement, private placement memorandum or other offering documents
for any Secondary Market Transaction. Lender and the Rating Agencies shall be
entitled to rely upon such information. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Borrowers and Guarantor shall provide in connection with each (i) preliminary
and final private placement memorandum or (ii) a preliminary and final
prospectus or prospectus supplement, as applicable, prepared in connection with
any Secondary Market Transaction (the documents referred to in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS"), an agreement
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers and Guarantor certifying that the
Borrowers and Guarantor have examined such Disclosure Documents specified by
Lender and, that the sections of such Disclosure Document describing the
Borrowers, Guarantor, the Properties and Manager do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not materially misleading. The Borrowers and Guarantor shall each
indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Lender, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MERRILL LYNCH"), and their respective Affiliates,
directors, employees, agents and each Person, if any, who controls Lender,
Merrill Lynch or any such Affiliate within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
any other placement agent or underwriter with respect to any Securitization or
Secondary Market Transaction from and against any losses, claims, damages and
liabilities that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Disclosure Document as to
the Borrowers, Guarantor, Manager and the Properties or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated in such information or necessary in order to make the
statements in such information not materially misleading; provided, however, the
Borrowers shall not be required to indemnify Merrill Lynch for any liabilities
arising out of untrue statements or omissions that were identified to Lender in
writing or are set forth in any third party report not prepared by the Borrowers
or their Affiliates unless such reports are caused to be incorrect or misleading
based upon information provided by the Borrowers or their Affiliates. Lender may
publicize the existence of the Obligations in connection with Lender's Secondary
Market Transaction activities or otherwise.

SECTION 10.4 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. In any Secondary Market Transaction, Lender
may transfer its obligations under this Loan Agreement and under the other Loan
Documents (or may transfer the portion thereof corresponding to the transferred
portion of the Obligations), and thereafter Lender shall be relieved of any
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents arising after the date
of said transfer with respect to the transferred interest. Each transferee
investor shall become a "Lender" hereunder.

indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, any

Encumbrances) of (i) all or any part of any Property or any interest therein, or

voluntary or involuntary sales, encumbrances, conveyances, transfers and pledges
(each, a "TRANSFER") of a direct, indirect or beneficial interest in any

INTEREST TRANSFERS"):

      (A) A Transfer of no more than forty-nine percent (49%) of the direct or
indirect ownership interests in such Borrower (in the aggregate), provided that,
following such Transfer, Guarantor maintains control of such Borrower.

      (B) A Transfer or a series of Transfers that result in the proposed
transferee, together with Affiliates of such transferee, owning in the aggregate
(directly or indirectly) more than forty-nine percent (49%) of the economic and
beneficial interests in such Borrower (where, prior to such Transfer, such
proposed transferee and its Affiliates owned in the aggregate (directly or
indirectly) forty-nine percent (49%) or less of such interests in that
Borrower); and, provided that such Transfer shall not be a Permitted Ownership
Interest Transfer unless Lender receives, prior to such Transfer, both (x)
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender (which shall include a legal
non-consolidation opinion reasonably acceptable to Lender and the Rating

thereto in the definition of "Affiliate" in Section 1.1 and a "change of
control" of any Person shall include the Transfer of legal or equitable
ownership interests in such Person which after giving effect to such

                                       97

and thereby and insured under the Title Policies are first priority Liens on the
respective remaining Properties subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances
applicable to the remaining Properties and (ii) that the Title Policies remain

have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of any individual Property or on the
Properties taken as a whole, will not materially impair the utility of any
individual Property or the Properties, taken as a whole, and will not result in
a reduction or abatement of, or right of offset against, the Rents payable under

Borrower Bankruptcy caused by Mezzanine Lender following the exercise by

any other security document, (iv) impair the rights of Lender to enforce any

Party but not any Exculpated Party to the extent necessary to obtain any amount
for which such Borrower Party may be liable in accordance with this Article or
any other Loan Document.

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                 WAIVERS OF DEFENSES OF GUARANTORS AND SURETIES

SECTION 13.1 WAIVERS. To the extent that any of the Borrowers (in this Article,
a "WAIVING PARTY") is deemed for any reason to be a guarantor or surety of or
for any other Borrower Party or Affiliate or to have rights or obligations in
the nature of the rights or obligations of a guarantor or surety (whether by
reason of execution of a guaranty, provision of security for the obligations of
another, or otherwise) then this Article shall apply. This Article shall not
affect the rights of the Waiving Party other than to waive or limit rights and
defenses that Waiving Party would have (i) in its capacity as a guarantor or
surety or (ii) in its capacity as one having rights or obligations in the nature
of a guarantor or surety.

      Waiving Party hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
filing of claims with a court in the event of receivership or bankruptcy of any
of the other Borrower Parties, protest or notice with respect to any of the
obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties, setoffs and counterclaims and
all presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests,
notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of acceptance, the benefits
of all statutes of limitation, and all other demands whatsoever (and shall not
require that the same be made on any of the other Borrower Parties as a
condition precedent to the obligations of Waiving Party), and covenants that the
Loan Documents will not be discharged, except by complete payment and
performance of the obligations evidenced and secured thereby, except only as
limited by the express contractual provisions of the Loan Documents. Waiving
Party further waives all notices that the principal amount, or any portion
thereof, and/or any interest on any instrument or document evidencing all or any
part of the obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties to Lender is due,
notices of any and all proceedings to collect from any of the other Borrower
Parties or any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of their
obligations, or from any other person or entity, and, to the extent permitted by
law, notices of

                                      103
<PAGE>

exchange, sale, surrender or other handling of any security or collateral given
to Lender to secure payment of all or any part of the obligations of any of the
other Borrower Parties.

      Except only to the extent provided otherwise in the express contractual
provisions of the Loan Documents, Waiving Party hereby agrees that all of its
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect,
without defense, offset or counterclaim of any kind, notwithstanding that any
right of Waiving Party against any of the other Borrower Parties or defense of
Waiving Party against Lender may be impaired, destroyed, or otherwise affected
by reason of any action or inaction on the part of Lender. Waiving Party waives
all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Lender,
even though that election of remedies, may have destroyed the Waiving Party's
rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the other Borrower Parties.

      Lender is hereby authorized, without notice or demand, from time to time,
(a) to renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or
other terms relating to, all or any part of the obligations of any of the other
Borrower Parties; (b) to accept partial payments on all or any part of the
obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties; (c) to take and hold security
or collateral for the payment of all or any part of the obligations of any of
the other Borrower Parties; (d) to exchange, enforce, waive and release any such
security or collateral for such obligations; (e) to apply such security or
collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in its discretion
it may determine; (f) to settle, release, exchange, enforce, waive, compromise
or collect or otherwise liquidate all or any part of such obligations and any
security or collateral for such obligations. Any of the foregoing may be done in
any manner, and Waiving Party agrees that the same shall not affect or impair
the obligations of Waiving Party under the Loan Documents.

      Waiving Party hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of
the financial condition of all of the other Borrower Parties and any and all
endorsers and/or other guarantors of all or any part of the obligations of the
other Borrower Parties, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of
nonpayment of such obligations, and Waiving Party hereby agrees that Lender
shall have no duty to advise Waiving Party of information known to it regarding
such condition or any such circumstances.

      Waiving Party agrees that neither Lender nor any person or entity acting
for or on behalf of Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets
in favor of Waiving Party or against or in payment of any or all of the
obligations secured hereby. Waiving Party further agrees that, to the extent
that any of the other Borrower Parties or any other guarantor of all or any part
of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties makes a payment or payments to
Lender, or Lender receives any proceeds of collateral for any of the obligations
of the other Borrower Parties, which payment or payments or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid or refunded, then, to the extent of such payment or
repayment, the part of such obligations which has been paid, reduced or
satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and
effect as of the time immediately preceding such initial payment, reduction or
satisfaction.

      Waiving Party (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect to the
obligations of the other Borrower Parties; (ii) waives any right to enforce any
remedy that Lender now has or may

                                      104
<PAGE>

hereafter have against any of the other Borrower Parties any endorser or any
guarantor of all or any part of such obligations or any other person; and (iii)
waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or
collateral given to Lender to secure the payment or performance of all or any
part of such obligations or any other liability of the other parties to Lender.

      Waiving Party agrees that any and all claims that it may have against any
of the other Borrower Parties, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any
part of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties, or against any of their
respective properties, shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to
the prior payment in full of all obligations secured hereby. Notwithstanding any
right of any of the Waiving Party to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any
payment from the other Borrower Parties, all rights, liens and security
interests of Waiving Party, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever
existing, in any assets of any of the other Borrower Parties (whether
constituting part of the security or collateral given to Lender to secure
payment of all or any part of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties or
otherwise) shall be and hereby are subordinated to the rights of Lender in those
assets.

                                  ARTICLE XIV

set off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law,
common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such recovery, the
Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens,
if any, and rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set
off had not occurred.

AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER AND
THEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF
NEW YORK AND ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA EXCEPT THAT AT

ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE WHERE THE

by Lender in this transaction. No provision in this Loan Agreement or in any of
the other Loan Documents and no course of dealing between the parties shall be
deemed to create (i) any partnership or joint venture between Lender and the
Borrowers or any other Person, or (ii) any fiduciary or similar duty by Lender
to the Borrowers or any other Person. The relationship between Lender and the
Borrowers is exclusively the relationship of a creditor and a debtor, and all
relationships between Lender and any other Borrower are ancillary to such
creditor/debtor relationship.

SECTION 14.14 REASONABLENESS OF DETERMINATIONS. In any instance where any
consent, approval, determination or other action by Lender is, pursuant to the
Loan Documents or applicable law, required to be done reasonably or required not
to be unreasonably withheld, then Lender's action shall be presumed to be
reasonable, and the Borrowers shall bear the burden of proof of showing that the

Lender or its agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in
any

<PAGE>

case where, by law or under this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
Lender or such agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or
promptly, neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any monetary
damages, and the Borrowers' sole remedy shall be limited to commencing an action
seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. Any action or proceeding to
determine whether Lender has acted reasonably shall be determined by an action
seeking declaratory judgment.

officer, director, employee, attorney, or agent of Lender, shall have any
liability with respect to, and each of the Borrowers hereby waives, releases,

incidental, or consequential damages suffered or incurred by the Borrower

Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, or agents for punitive
damages in respect of any claim in connection with, arising out of, or in any
way related to, this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any

shall be inconsistent with any term, condition or provision of any other Loan

RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE,
MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER
SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS

                       CERTIFICATE REGARDING WORK RESERVES

            THIS CERTIFICATION is made as of __________ by the undersigned (the
"Borrowers") to and for the benefit of: (i) the current holder (the "Holder") of
Loan No. ________ and ________ (the "Loans"), and (ii)
_________________________, as mortgage servicer on behalf of the Holder (the
"Servicer"), in order to induce the Servicer to advance to the Borrower the
aggregate sum of $__________ from the _______________ [describe name of reserve
account] Reserve, as provided under Section 6.7 the Loan and Security Agreement
evidencing the Loan (the "Loan Agreement").

            Capitalized terms used in this Certification that are not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan
Agreement.

            The undersigned hereby certifies to the Holder and Servicer as
follows:

            1.    No event, fact or circumstance has occurred or failed to occur
                  which constitutes, or upon the lapse of time, or the giving of
                  notice, or both, could constitute a Default or an Event of
                  Default under the Loan Documents. The Loan Documents remain
                  the valid and legally binding obligations of the undersigned
                  and are fully enforceable in accordance with their terms.

            2.    The portion of the Work that relates to the subject
                  disbursement request has been delivered or provided to
                  Borrower in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance
                  with the plans and specifications therefor, if applicable,
                  approved by Lender and in accordance with all legal
                  requirements of governmental authorities having jurisdiction
                  over the Property, or deposits for work or materials that
                  relate to the subject disbursement request have been paid by
                  Borrower, as applicable.

            3.    All of the statements, invoices, receipts and information
                  delivered in connection with the subject disbursement request
                  are true and correct as of the date hereof, and each person
                  that supplied materials or labor in connection with the Work
                  to be funded by the subject disbursement request has been paid
                  in full to date, or will be paid in full to date upon such
                  disbursement, subject to any applicable retainage. The actual
                  costs incurred in connection with the subject disbursement
                  request do not materially exceed the amount budgeted for such
                  Work under the CapEx/FF&E Budget in effect and constitute
                  expenditures for Capital Improvements.

            4.    None of the labor, materials, overhead or other items of
                  expense specified in the disbursement request submitted
                  herewith, other than payments on account of retainage, has
                  previously been the basis of any disbursement request by the
                  Borrower or any payment by the Servicer, other than for

                                    Exhibit L

<PAGE>

                  partially completed work or deposits and, when added to all
                  sums previously disbursed by the Servicer on account of the
                  related work, do not exceed the costs of all services
                  completed, installed and/or delivered, or deposits made, as
                  applicable, as of the date of this certificate. In addition,
                  the amount remaining in the subject reserve will be sufficient
                  to pay in full the entire remaining cost of related work
                  required to be completed in accordance with the Loan
                  Agreement.

            5.    None of the materials or other items of expense specified in
                  the disbursement request submitted herewith are stored at any
                  Property unless such materials are properly stored and secured
                  at the applicable Property in accordance with the Borrowers'
                  customary procedures and sound construction practices as
                  reasonably determined by Lender. None of the materials or
                  other items of expense specified in the disbursement request
                  submitted herewith are stored at any location other than at
                  the Properties unless Lender determines in its reasonable
                  discretion that Lender has a perfected first priority security
                  interest in any such materials.

            6.    All permits and approvals required to complete the work in
                  process have been obtained. All conditions to the disbursement
                  have been met in accordance with the terms of the Loan
                  Agreement.

            7.    The individual that is signing below on behalf of the Borrower
                  has made due investigation of the matters herein set forth,
                  and acknowledges that the Servicer is relying upon the
                  certification made herein as a condition to advancing the
                  requested reserve disbursement.

            8.    This Certification shall be deemed to be a "Loan Document" as
                  that term is defined in the Loan Agreement. Accordingly, an
                  uncured breach of any representation or warranty set forth
                  herein shall constitute an Event of Default under the
                  Mortgages and the Loan Documents.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower has executed this Certification under
seal as of the date written above.
