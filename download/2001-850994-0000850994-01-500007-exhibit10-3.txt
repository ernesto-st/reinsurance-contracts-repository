               from  the  Closing  Date  to but  excluding  the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitment Termination Date an aggregate amount not exceeding its
               Pro Rata  Share of the  aggregate  amount of the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments to be used for the purposes  identified in subsection
               2.5A.  The  original  amount  of  each  Lender's  Revolving  Loan
               Commitment is set forth opposite its name on Schedule 2.1 annexed
               hereto and the aggregate  original  amount of the Revolving  Loan
               Commitments  is  $17,500,000,  provided that the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments  of Lenders  shall be  adjusted to give effect to (a)
               any Revolving Loan  Commitment  increases  pursuant to subsection
               2.1A(iii)  and  (b)  any   assignments   of  the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments pursuant to subsection 10.1B;  provided further, that
               the amount of the  Revolving  Loan  Commitments  shall be reduced
               from time to time by the amount of any  reductions  thereto  made
               pursuant to subsection 2.4B(ii) and 2.4B(iii). Lenders' Revolving
               Loan  Commitments  shall expire on the Revolving Loan  Commitment
               Termination  Date and all  Revolving  Loans and all other amounts
               owed  hereunder  with  respect  to the  Revolving  Loans  and the
               Revolving  Loan  Commitments  shall be paid in full no later than
               that date.  Amounts  borrowed under this  subsection  2.1A may be
               repaid  and  reborrowed  to  but  excluding  the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitment Termination Date.

Anything  contained in this  Agreement to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  (i) a
portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments  equal to the Required LOC Amount,  as
in effect from time to time,  may only be used for issuance and  maintenance  of
the Phase I LOC, (ii) in no event shall the Total  Utilization of Revolving Loan
Commitments  exceed an amount equal to the aggregate  Revolving Loan Commitments
then in effect less the Debt Service  Reserve Amount except for Revolving  Loans
the proceeds of which are used to pay obligations hereunder and(iii) in no event
shall the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments at any time exceed the
Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect.

               (iii) Increases of the Term Loans or Revolving Loan  Commitments.
               At the mutual  discretion of Borrower and  Administrative  Agent,
               Borrower  may  request in  writing at any time  during the period
               from the date  hereof  to and  including  the day  preceding  the
               Revolving  Loan  Commitment  Termination  Date  that (x) the then
               effective  aggregate principal amount of Term Loans be increased,
               and/or  (y) the then  effective  aggregate  principal  amount  of
               Revolving Loan  Commitments  be increased;  provided that (1) the
               aggregate  principal amount of the increases in Term Loans and/or

                                       19
<PAGE>

               Revolving Loan Commitments  pursuant to this subsection 2.1A(iii)
               shall not exceed $12,500,000, (2) Borrower may not make more than
               one request for such increase in Term Loans and/or Revolving Loan
               Commitments,  (3) no  Event  of  Default  or  Potential  Event of
               Default shall have occurred and be continuing or shall occur as a
               result of such  increases  in Term Loans  and/or  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments, (4) Borrower shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
               to, execute and deliver such documents and  instruments  and take
               such other  actions  (including,  without  limitation,  obtaining
               appropriate  endorsements to title insurance  policies) as may be
               reasonably  requested by Administrative  Agent in connection with
               such increases. Any request under this subsection 2.1A(iii) shall
               be  submitted  by Borrower to  Administrative  Agent (which shall
               forward copies to Lenders),  specify the proposed  effective date
               and amount of such  increase and be  accompanied  by an Officer's
               Certificate  stating that no Event of Default or Potential  Event
               of Default exists or will occur as a result of such increase.  No
               Lender shall have any obligation, express or implied, to offer to
               increase  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of its Term  Loan or
               Revolving Loan  Commitment,  as the case may be. Only the consent
               of any Lender  agreeing to increase  its Term Loans or  Revolving
               Loan  Commitments,  as the  case  may  be  (each  an  "Increasing
               Lender")  shall be  required  for an  increase  in the  aggregate
               principal amount of Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments,  as
               the case may be, pursuant to this subsection 2.1A(iii). No Lender
               which  elects not to increase  the  principal  amount of its Term
               Loan or  Revolving  Loan  Commitment,  as the case may be, may be
               replaced in respect of its existing  Term Loan or Revolving  Loan
               Commitment,  as the case may be, as a result thereof without such
               Lender's consent.

                              Each   Increasing   Lender   shall   as   soon  as
               practicable  specify the amount of the proposed increase which it
               is  willing  to assume.  Borrower  may accept  some or all of the
               offered  amounts or designate new lenders who qualify as Eligible
               Assignees and which are reasonably  acceptable to  Administrative
               Agent as additional  Lenders  hereunder in  accordance  with this
               subsection 2.1A(iii) (each such new lender being a "New Lender"),
               which New Lender may assume all or a portion of the  increase  in
               the  aggregate  principal  amount of the Term Loans or  Revolving
               Loan  Commitments,  as the case may be provided that any addition
               of a New Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment shall be subject
               to the prior  approval of  Administrative  Agent and each Issuing
               Lender  (which  approval  may be given or  withheld in their sole
               discretion).   Borrower  and  Administrative   Agent  shall  have
               discretion  jointly to adjust  the  allocation  of the  increased
               aggregate  principal  amount  of Term  Loans  or  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments, as the case may be, among Increasing Lenders and New
               Lenders. Goldman Sachs, Dresdner Bank, Regiment Capital and Union
               Bank  of  Switzerland   shall  be  deemed  to  be  acceptable  to
               Administrative Agent for purposes of this section,  provided that
               Regiment  Capital  shall  be  deemed  acceptable  only  as a Term
               Lender.

                              Each  New  Lender   designated   by  Borrower  and
               acceptable  to  Administrative  Agent shall become an  additional
               party hereto as a New Lender  concurrently with the effectiveness
               of the proposed increase in the aggregate principal amount of the
               Term Loans or  Revolving  Loan  Commitments,  as the case may be,
               upon its  execution  of an  Agreement  of  Joinder in the form of
               Exhibit XIII.

                              Subject to the foregoing,  any increase  requested
               by  Borrower  shall  be  effective  as of the  date  proposed  by
               Borrower  and shall be in the  principal  amount equal to (i) the
               principal amount which  Increasing  Lenders are willing to assume
               as  increases  to the  principal  amount of their  Term  Loans or
               Revolving  Loan  Commitments,  as the case may be,  plus (ii) the
               principal  amount  offered by New  Lenders  with  respect to Term
               Loans or  Revolving  Loan  Commitments,  as the  case may be,  in
               either  case as adjusted by  Borrower  and  Administrative  Agent
               pursuant to this subsection  2.1A(iii).  All new Term Loans to be
               made under this subsection 2.1A(iii) shall be made to Borrower on
               the same day as such increase in Term Loans under this subsection
               2.1A(iii)  becomes  effective  (the "Term Loan Funding Date") and
               proceeds of such Term Loans shall be applied  first to reduce any
               Revolving Loans then outstanding. In addition, if any New Lenders
               and/or   Increasing   Lender   increase   their   Revolving  Loan
               Commitments  or assume new  Revolving  Loan  Commitments  and any
               Revolving Loans are then outstanding  (after giving effect to any
               prepayment  to  occur  on  such  date  in  accordance   with  the
               immediately  preceding  sentence),  borrowings  shall  be made by
               Borrower  on  the  date  such  lenders   become  New  Lenders  or
               Increasing  Lenders and applied to prepay  outstanding  Revolving
               Loans of Lenders holding Revolving Loan Commitments prior to such
               increase  (in  accordance  with  their Pro Rata  Shares in effect

                                       20
<PAGE>

               before giving effect to such increase) to the extent necessary so
               that after giving effect to such borrowings and prepayments,  the
               outstanding  Revolving Loans of each Lender with a Revolving Loan
               Commitment  shall be in  accordance  with such  Lender's Pro Rata
               Share. Such New Lenders and/or Increasing Lenders shall be deemed
               to have, and each such Lender agrees to, purchase a participation
               in all  outstanding  Letters of Credit and any  drawings  honored
               thereunder equal to such New Lender's and/or Increasing  Lender's
               Pro Rata Share from each of the other Lenders with Revolving Loan
               Commitments.  Upon  effectiveness  of any such increase,  the Pro
               Rata Share of each  Lender will be adjusted to give effect to the
               increase in Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case
               may be,  Administrative  Agent  shall  distribute  to  Lenders  a
               revised  Schedule 2.1  reflecting  the Term Loan,  Revolving Loan
               Commitment  and Pro Rata Share of each Lender after giving effect
               to such  increase.  To the extent that the adjustment of Pro Rata
               Shares  results in loss or  expenses to any Lender as a result of
               the  prepayment  of any Adjusted  Eurodollar  Rate Loan on a date
               other  than the  scheduled  last day of the  applicable  Interest
               Period,  Borrower shall be  responsible  for such loss or expense
               pursuant to subsection 2.6D. Notwithstanding anything in Sections
               2.2 , 2.3,  3.2 and 3.3D(ii) to the  contrary,  to the extent the
               Revolving Loan  Commitments are added after the Closing Date, any
               portion  of  commitment  fees or  interest  accrued in respect of
               Revolving Loans or Revolving Loan  Commitments  prior to the date
               of such  increase  in  Revolving  Loan  Commitments  shall not be
               payable in respect of such added  Revolving Loan  Commitments but
               shall  be  payable  only  to  Lenders   holding   Revolving  Loan
               Commitments  prior to such  increase  in  accordance  with  their
               respective Pro Rata Shares as in effect prior to such increase in
               the Revolving Loan Commitments.

               B. Borrowing Mechanics. Term Loans or Revolving Loans made on any
Funding Date other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to subsection 3.3B for the
purpose of  reimbursing  any Issuing  Lender for the amount of a drawing under a
Letter of Credit issued by it),  shall be in an aggregate  minimum amount of (x)
$500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount in the case
of Term Loans and (y) $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in the case of
Revolving Loans.

               Whenever  Borrower  desires  that  Lenders  make  Loans  it shall
deliver to  Administrative  Agent a Notice of Borrowing no later than 10:00 A.M.
(New York City time) at least  three  Business  Days in advance of the  proposed
Funding  Date (in the case of a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan) or at least one Business
Day in advance of the  proposed  Funding Date (in the case of a Base Rate Loan).
The Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the proposed Funding Date (which shall
be a Business Day), (ii) the amount and type of Loans  requested,  (iii) whether
such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans or  Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  and (iv) in the
case of any Loans  requested to be made as  Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  the initial
Interest Period requested therefore.  Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent
prior to the  funding of any Loans in the event that any of the matters to which
Borrower is  required to certify in the  applicable  Notice of  Borrowing  is no
longer true and correct as of the applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by
Borrower of the  proceeds of any Loans shall  constitute a  re-certification  by
Borrower, as of the applicable Funding Date, as to the matters to which Borrower
is required to certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.

               Except as otherwise  provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6G,
a Notice of Borrowing  for a Eurodollar  Rate Loan shall be  irrevocable  on and
after the related Interest Rate Determination  Date, and Borrower shall be bound
to make a borrowing in accordance therewith.

               C.  Disbursement  of Funds.  All Loans of a particular type under
this Agreement  shall be made by Lenders  holding  Commitments for loans of that
type  simultaneously and proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it
being  understood  that no Lender  shall be  responsible  for any default by any
other  Lender  in  that  other  Lender's  obligation  to  make a Loan  requested
hereunder nor shall the Commitment of any Lender to make the particular  type of
Loan  requested  be increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other
Lender in that other  Lender's  obligation to make a Loan  requested  hereunder.
Promptly after receipt by Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant
to  subsection  2.1B,  Administrative  Agent  shall  notify  each  Lender of the
proposed  borrowing.  Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to
Administrative  Agent  not later  than  12:00  Noon (New York City  time) on the
applicable  Funding  Date,  in same day funds in  Dollars,  at the  Funding  and
Payment Office.  Except as provided in subsection 3.3B with respect to Revolving
Loans used to reimburse  any Issuing  Lender for the amount of a drawing under a
Letter of Credit  issued by it, upon  satisfaction  or waiver of the  conditions
precedent  specified  in  subsection  4.2,  Administrative  Agent shall make the
aggregate  amount of the Loans  received by  Administrative  Agent from  Lenders
available by crediting the account of Borrower at the Funding and Payment Office
in the amount of such  Loans  provided  that if  Scotiabank  is the only  Lender
hereunder,  Scotiabank  agrees to fund such Loans  directly  to such  account of
Borrower as Borrower shall designate in a written notice to Scotiabank.

               Unless  Administrative  Agent  shall  have been  notified  by any

                                       21
<PAGE>

Lender  prior to the Funding Date for any Loans that such Lender does not intend
to make  available  to  Administrative  Agent the amount of such  Lender's  Loan
requested on such Funding Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such amount available to Administrative  Agent on such Funding Date and
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Borrower a corresponding  amount on such Funding Date. If such
corresponding  amount is not in fact made available to  Administrative  Agent by
such   Lender,   Administrative   Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  recover   such
corresponding  amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from  such  Funding  Date  until  the date  such  amount is paid to
Administrative  Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the
correction of errors among banks for three  Business Days and  thereafter at the
Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding  amount forthwith upon
Administrative  Agent's  demand  therefor,  Administrative  Agent shall promptly
notify Borrower and Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding  amount to
Administrative  Agent  together  with interest  thereon,  for each day from such
Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative  Agent, at the
rate  payable  under  this  Agreement  for  Base  Rate  Loans.  Nothing  in this
subsection  2.1C shall be deemed to relieve  any Lender from its  obligation  to
fulfill its  Commitments  hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrower may
have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

               D. The Register.

               (i)  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  a  register  for the
               recordation   of  the  names  and  address  of  Lenders  and  the
               Commitments  and  Loans of each  Lender  from  time to time  (the
               "Register").  The Register  shall be available for  inspection by
               Borrower  at any  reasonable  time  and  from  time to time  upon
               reasonable prior notice.

               (ii)  Administrative  Agent  shall  record  in the  Register  the
               Commitment  and the Loans from time to time of each  Lender,  and
               each  repayment or prepayment in respect of the principal  amount
               of the  Loans  of each  Lender.  Any  such  recordation  shall be
               conclusive  and  binding  on  Borrower  and  each  Lender  absent
               manifest   error;   provided   that  failure  to  make  any  such
               recordation,  or any error in such recordation,  shall not affect
               any Lender's Commitments or Borrower's  Obligations in respect of
               any applicable Loans.

               (iii) Each Lender shall record on its internal records (including
               the Notes held by such Lender) the amount of each Loan made by it
               and each payment in respect thereof.  Any such recordation  shall
               be conclusive  and binding on Borrower,  absent  manifest  error;
               provided that failure to make any such recordation,  or any error
               in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or
               Borrower's  Obligations  in  respect  of  any  applicable  Loans;
               provided further that in the event of any  inconsistency  between
               the Register and any Lender's  records,  the  recordations in the
               Register shall govern.

               (iv)  Administrative  Agent and Lenders  shall deem and treat the
               Persons  listed as Lenders in the  Register  as the  holders  and
               owners of the corresponding  Commitments and Loans listed therein
               for all purposes  hereof,  and no  assignment  or transfer of any
               such  Commitment or Loan shall be effective,  in each case unless
               and until an Assignment  Agreement  effecting  the  assignment or
               transfer thereof shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent
               and recorded in the Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii).
               Prior to such  recordation,  all amounts owed with respect to the
               applicable  Commitment or Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed
               in the Register as the owner thereof, and any request,  authority
               or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such  request
               or giving such authority or consent, is listed in the Register as
               a Lender  shall  be  conclusive  and  binding  on any  subsequent
               holder,  assignee or transferee of the corresponding  Commitments
               or Loans.

               E. Note.

               Borrower  shall  execute and deliver (i) on the Term Loan Funding
               Date  to  each  Lender  with  a  Term  Loan   Commitment  (or  to
               Administrative  Agent for that Lender) a Term Note  substantially
               in the form of Exhibit  III-A  annexed  hereto to  evidence  that
               Lender's  Term Loans,  in the  principal  amount of that Lender's
               Term Loan  Commitment and (ii) on the Closing Date to each Lender
               with a Revolving Loan Commitment (or to Administrative  Agent for
               that  Lender)  a  Revolving  Note  substantially  in the  form of
               Exhibit III-B annexed hereto to evidence that Lender's  Revolving
               Loans,  in the principal  amount of that Lender's  Revolving Loan
               Commitment and with other  appropriate  insertions on the Closing
               Date  to  each  Lender  with  a  Revolving   Commitment   (or  to
               Administrative Agent for that Lender).

               Administrative  Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as

                                       22

               the owner  thereof for all  purposes  hereof  unless and until an
               Assignment Agreement effecting the assignment or transfer thereof
               shall have been accepted by  Administrative  Agent as provided in
               subsection  10.1B(ii).  Any request,  authority or consent of any
               person  or entity  who,  at the time of making  such  request  or
               giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall
               be conclusive and binding on any subsequent  holder,  assignee or
               transferee  of  that  Note  or of any  Note or  Notes  issued  in
               exchange therefor.

2.2       Interest on the Loans.
---       ----------------------

               A. Rate of Interest. Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.6
and 2.7, each Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid  principal  amount  thereof
from the date made through maturity  (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a
rate determined by reference to the Base Rate or the Adjusted  Eurodollar  Rate.
The applicable  basis for  determining  the rate of interest with respect to any
Loan shall be selected by Borrower  initially  at the time a Notice of Borrowing
is given with respect to such Loan  pursuant to subsection  2.1B,  and the basis
for  determining  the interest rate with respect to any Loan may be changed from
time to time  pursuant to subsection  2.2D. If on any day a Loan is  outstanding
with respect to which notice has not been delivered to  Administrative  Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement  specifying the applicable basis for
determining  the rate of  interest,  then for that  day  that  Loan  shall  bear
interest determined by reference to the Base Rate.

               (i) Revolving  Loans.  Subject to the  provisions of  subsections
               2.2E and 2.7, the  Revolving  Loans shall bear  interest  through
               maturity as follows:  (a) if a Base Rate Loan,  at the sum of the
               Base Rate plus 3%; or (b) if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at
               the sum of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 4%.

               (ii) Term Loans.  Subject to the provisions of  subsections  2.2E
               and 2.7, the Revolving Loans shall bear interest through maturity
               as follows:  (a) if a Base Rate Loan, at the sum of the Base Rate
               plus 3%; or (b) if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at the sum of the
               Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 4%.

               B. Interest  Periods.  In connection  with each  Eurodollar  Rate
Loan,  Borrower may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation,  as the case may be, select an interest period (each an
"Interest  Period") to be applicable to such Loan,  which Interest  Period shall
be, at Borrower's option, either a one, two, three or six month period; provided
that:

               (i) the  initial  Interest  Period for any  Eurodollar  Rate Loan
               shall  commence on the Funding  Date in respect of such Loan,  in
               the case of a Loan initially  made as a Eurodollar  Rate Loan, or
               on   the   date   specified   in   the   applicable   Notice   of
               Conversion/Continuation,  in the  case of a Loan  converted  to a
               Eurodollar Rate Loan;

               (ii)  in the  case of  immediately  successive  Interest  Periods
               applicable to a Eurodollar  Rate Loan  continued as such pursuant
               to a Notice of Conversion/Continuation,  each successive Interest
               Period  shall  commence  on the day on which  the next  preceding
               Interest Period expires;

               (iii) if an Interest Period would otherwise  expire on a day that
               is not a Business Day,  such Interest  Period shall expire on the
               next  succeeding  Business  Day;  provided  that, if any Interest
               Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day
               but is a day of the month  after  which no further  Business  Day
               occurs in such month,  such  Interest  Period shall expire on the
               next preceding Business Day;

               (iv) any Interest  Period that begins on the last Business Day of
               a calendar  month (or on a day for which there is no  numerically
               corresponding  day in the  calendar  month  at  the  end of  such
               Interest Period) shall,  subject to clause (v) of this subsection
               2.2B, end on the last Business Day of a calendar month;

               (v) no Interest  Period with  respect to any portion of the Loans
               shall extend beyond June 30, 2003;

               (vi) no  Interest  Period  shall  extend  beyond  a date on which
               Borrowers  are required to make a scheduled  payment of principal
               of the  Loans or a  permanent  reduction  of the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments  is  scheduled  to  occur  unless  the sum of (a) the
               aggregate principal amount of Loans that are Base Rate Loans plus
               (b) the aggregate  principal  amount of Loans that are Eurodollar
               Rate Loans with Interest  Periods expiring on or before such date
               plus (c) the excess of the  Commitments  then in effect  over the



                                       23
<PAGE>

               aggregate  principal amount of the Loans then outstanding  equals
               or exceeds the principal amount required to be paid on the Loans,
               or the permanent  reduction of the Commitments  that is scheduled
               to occur, on such date;

               (vii) there shall be no more than 6 Interest Periods  outstanding
               at any time  provided  that if, in  accordance  with the terms of
               this  Agreement,   the  amount  of  Loans   outstanding   exceeds
               $15,000,000,  then  during the  period in which the Loans  exceed
               that  amount,  the maximum  number of Interest  Periods  shall be
               increased to 8; and

               (viii) in the event Borrower fails to specify an Interest  Period
               for  any  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  in  the  applicable  Notice  of
               Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Borrower shall be
               deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month.

               C.  Interest  Payments.  Subject to the  provisions of subsection
2.2E,  interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to each Interest
Payment Date  applicable to that Loan,  upon any prepayment of that Loan (to the
extent  accrued on the amount being  prepaid) and at maturity  (including  final
maturity).

               D.  Conversion  or  Continuation.  Subject to the  provisions  of
subsection 2.6, Borrower shall have the option (i) to convert at any time all or
any part of its  outstanding  Loans equal to $500,000 and integral  multiples of
$100,000  in  excess  of that  amount  from  Loans  bearing  interest  at a rate
determined  by  reference  to one  basis to  Loans  bearing  interest  at a rate
determined by reference to an  alternative  basis or (ii) upon the expiration of
any Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any
portion of such Loan equal to $500,000  and  integral  multiples  of $100,000 in
excess of that  amount as a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan;  provided,  however,  that a
Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  may  only  be  converted  into a Base  Rate  Loan on the
expiration date of an Interest Period applicable thereto.

               Borrower  shall  deliver a Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  to
Administrative  Agent no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least one
Business  Day in  advance  of the  proposed  conversion  date  (in the case of a
conversion  to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three  Business Days in advance of
the proposed  conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a
continuation  of, a Eurodollar  Rate Loan). A Notice of  Conversion/Continuation
shall  specify (i) the proposed  conversion/continuation  date (which shall be a
Business Day),  (ii) the amount and type of the Loan to be  converted/continued,
(iii) the nature of the proposed conversion/continuation,  (iv) in the case of a
conversion  to, or a  continuation  of, a Eurodollar  Rate Loan,  the  requested
Interest Period, and (v) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, that no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.  In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of
Conversion/Continuation,  Borrower  may  give  Administrative  Agent  telephonic
notice by the required time of any proposed  conversion/continuation  under this
subsection  2.2D;  provided  that such  notice  shall be promptly  confirmed  in
writing by delivery  of a Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  to  Administrative
Agent on or before the proposed  conversion/continuation  date.  Upon receipt of
written or telephonic notice of any proposed  conversion/continuation under this
subsection  2.2D,  Administrative  Agent shall promptly  transmit such notice by
telefacsimile or telephone to each Lender.

               Neither  Administrative  Agent  nor any  Lender  shall  incur any
liability  to Borrower in acting upon any  telephonic  notice  referred to above
that  Administrative  Agent  believes in good faith to have been given by a duly
authorized  officer or other person  authorized  to act on behalf of Borrower or
for  otherwise  acting  in good  faith  under  this  subsection  2.2D,  and upon
conversion or continuation of the applicable  basis for determining the interest
rate with respect to any Loans in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any
such   telephonic   notice   Borrower   shall  have  effected  a  conversion  or
continuation, as the case may be, hereunder.

               Except as otherwise  provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6G,
a Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  for conversion to, or  continuation  of, a
Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable
on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and Borrower shall be
bound to effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith.

               E. Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the  continuation
of any Event of Default,  the outstanding  principal amount of all Loans and, to
the extent  permitted by applicable law, any interest  payments thereon not paid
when due and any fees and other  amounts then due and payable  hereunder,  shall
thereafter  bear interest  (including  post-petition  interest in any proceeding
under the  Bankruptcy  Code or other  applicable  bankruptcy  laws) payable upon
demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest  rate  otherwise
payable under this Agreement  with respect to the  applicable  Loans (or, in the
case of any such  fees and  other  amounts,  at a rate  which is 2% per annum in
excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate
Loans); provided that, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the expiration
of the Interest  Period in effect at the time any such  increase in the interest
rate is effective such Eurodollar  Rate Loans shall  thereupon  become Base Rate

                                       24
<PAGE>

Loans and shall  thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate which is
2% per  annum in  excess of the  interest  rate  otherwise  payable  under  this
Agreement for Base Rate Loans.  Payment or acceptance of the increased  rates of
interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a permitted  alternative to
timely  payment  and shall not  constitute  a waiver of any Event of  Default or
otherwise  prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative  Agent or
any Lender.

               F.  Computation  of  Interest.  Interest  on the  Loans  shall be
computed  on the basis of (i) a 360-day  year,  in the case of  Eurodollar  Rate
Loans and (ii) a 365-day year,  in respect of Base Rate Loans,  in each case for
the actual  number of days  elapsed in the period  during  which it accrues.  In
computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first
day of an Interest  Period  applicable  to such Loan or, with  respect to a Base
Rate Loan being converted from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of
such  Eurodollar  Rate Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be
included,  and the date of  payment  of such Loan or the  expiration  date of an
Interest  Period  applicable  to such Loan or, with  respect to a Base Rate Loan
being  converted to a Eurodollar  Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base
Rate Loan to such  Eurodollar  Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded;
provided that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's
interest shall be paid on that Loan.

2.3       Commitment Fees.
---       ----------------

               A.  Commitment  Fees.  Borrower  agrees to pay to  Administrative
Agent,  for  distribution  to each Lender with a Revolving  Loan  Commitment  in
proportion to that Lender's Pro Rata Share,  commitment fees for the period from
and including the Closing Date to and  excluding the Revolving  Loan  Commitment
Termination  Date equal to the  average of the daily  excess of  Revolving  Loan
Commitments  over the sum of (i) the aggregate  principal  amount of outstanding
Revolving  Loans but not the  Letter of Credit  Usage,  plus (ii) the  Letter of
Credit Usage  multiplied  by half of 1% per annum,  such  commitment  fees to be
calculated  on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed
and to be payable  quarterly  in arrears on March 31, June 30,  September 30 and
December 31 of each year,  commencing  on the first such date to occur after the
Closing Date, and on the Commitment Termination Date.

               B.   Annual   Administrative   Fee.   Borrower   agrees   to  pay
Administrative Agent an annual administrative fee in the amount and at the times
separately agreed to by Administrative Agent and Borrower.

2.4       Repayments, Prepayments and Reductions in Commitment; General
---       -------------------------------------------------------------
          Provisions Regarding Payments.
          ------------------------------

               A.   Payment  at  Maturity.   Borrower   shall  repay  all  Loans
outstanding  hereunder  on June 30,  2003,  or any earlier  acceleration  of the
maturity  thereof  pursuant to Section 8 hereof,  together  with all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, and all other Obligations then outstanding hereunder.

               (i) Voluntary  Prepayments.  Borrower may, upon not less than one
               Business Day's prior written or telephonic notice, in the case of
               Base Rate  Loans,  and three  Business  Days'  prior  written  or
               telephonic  notice, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each
               case given to  Administrative  Agent (which  original  written or
               telephonic notice  Administrative Agent will promptly transmit by
               telefacsimile  or  telephone  to each  Lender) by 12:00 Noon (New
               York City time) on the date  required and, if given by telephone,
               promptly confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent at any time
               and from time to time  prepay  any Loans on any  Business  Day in
               whole or in part in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and
               integral   multiples  of  $500,000  in  excess  of  that  amount;
               provided,  however, that with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan
               not prepaid on the expiration of the Interest  Period  applicable
               thereto  Borrower  shall  pay  any  amount  payable  pursuant  to
               subsection  2.6D.  Notice  of  prepayment  having  been  given as
               aforesaid,  the principal  amount of the Loans  specified in such
               notice  shall  become  due and  payable  on the  prepayment  date
               specified therein. Any such voluntary prepayment shall be applied
               as specified in subsection 2.4B(iv).

               (ii) Voluntary Reductions of Revolving Loan Commitments. Borrower
               may,  upon not less than three  Business  Days' prior  written or
               telephonic  notice confirmed in writing to  Administrative  Agent
               (which original written or telephonic notice Administrative Agent
               will  promptly  transmit by  telefacsimile  or  telephone to each
               Lender) at any time and from time to time  terminate  in whole or
               permanently  reduce in part,  without  premium  or  penalty,  the
               Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount up to the amount by which
               the Revolving Loan  Commitments  exceed the Total  Utilization of
               Revolving   Loan   Commitments  at  the  time  of  such  proposed

                                       25
<PAGE>

               termination   or  reduction;   provided  that  any  such  partial
               reduction  of  the  Revolving  Loan  Commitments  shall  be in an
               aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral  multiples of
               $500,000  in  excess  of  that  amount.   Borrower's   notice  to
               Administrative  Agent shall  designate the date (which shall be a
               Business Day) of such  termination or reduction and the amount of
               any partial  reduction,  and such termination or reduction of the
               Revolving  Loan  Commitments  shall  be  effective  on  the  date
               specified in  Borrower's  notice and shall  reduce the  Revolving
               Loan  Commitment of each Lender  proportionately  to its Pro Rata
               Share.  Any  such  voluntary  reduction  of  the  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments shall be applied as specified in subsection 2.4B(iv).

               (iii)   Mandatory   Prepayments   and  Mandatory   Reductions  of
               Commitments.  The Loans shall be prepaid  and/or the  Commitments
               shall  be  permanently  reduced  in the  amounts  and  under  the
               circumstances   set  forth  below,   all  such   prepayments  and
               reductions to be applied as set forth below or more  specifically
               provided in subsection 2.4B(iv):

                    (a) Prepayments and Reductions From Net Asset Sale Proceeds.
               No later  than  the  first  Business  Day  following  the date of
               receipt by Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  of any Net Asset
               Sale  Proceeds in respect of any Asset Sale (other than Net Asset
               Sale Proceeds in respect of the sale of any obsolete, worn out or
               surplus assets or assets no longer used or useful in the business
               of the Phase II project  disposed of in  accordance  with Section
               7.7(ii)),  Borrower  shall prepay the Loans and/or the  Revolving
               Loan  Commitments  shall be  permanently  reduced in an aggregate
               amount equal to such Net Asset Sale Proceeds.

                    (b)  Prepayments  and Reductions  from Net Loss Proceeds and
               Liquidated  Damages.  Except as  provided in  subsection  6.4, no
               later than the second Business Day following  receipt by Borrower
               or any of its  Subsidiaries  of any Loss  Proceeds or  Liquidated
               Damages,  Borrower  shall prepay the Loans  and/or the  Revolving
               Loan Commitments shall be permanently  reduced in an amount equal
               to the Loss Proceeds or Liquidated Damages, as applicable.

                    (c) Prepayments and Reductions Due to Default or Termination
               Payments  Under  the Phase II Lease.  On the first  Business  Day
               following  receipt by Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries of any
               payment from Venetian  under the Phase II Lease  resulting from a
               default  by  Venetian  under  the  Phase  II  Lease  or from  the
               termination thereof,  whether such payment shall be characterized
               as damages, accelerated rent or otherwise,  Borrower shall prepay
               the  Loans  and/or  the  Revolving  Loan  Commitments   shall  be
               permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to such payment.

                    (d)  Calculations  of  Net  Proceeds   Amounts;   Additional
               Prepayments  and  Reductions  Based on  Subsequent  Calculations.
               Concurrently   with  any  prepayment  of  the  Loans  and/or  the
               reduction of Revolving Loan  Commitments  pursuant to subsections
               2.4B(iii)(a)-(c),  Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent
               an Officers'  Certificate  demonstrating  the  calculation of the
               amount (the "Net Proceeds  Amount") of the  applicable  Net Asset
               Sale  Proceeds,  Loss  Proceeds,   Liquidated  Damages  or  other
               amounts,  as the case may be,  that gave rise to such  prepayment
               and/or reduction.  In the event that Borrower shall  subsequently
               determine  that the actual Net  Proceeds  Amount was greater than
               the  amount  set forth in such  Officers'  Certificate,  Borrower
               shall  promptly  make  an  additional  prepayment  of  the  Loans
               (and/or,  if applicable,  the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
               permanently  reduced)  in an amount  equal to the  amount of such
               excess,  and Borrower  shall  concurrently  therewith  deliver to
               Administrative Agent an Officers'  Certificate  demonstrating the
               derivation of the  additional  Net Proceeds  Amount  resulting in
               such excess.

                    (e)   Prepayments  Due  to  Reductions  or  Restrictions  of
               Revolving  Loan  Commitments.  Borrower  shall  from time to time
               prepay the  Revolving  Loans to the extent  necessary (1) so that
               the Total  Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments shall not at
               any time exceed the Revolving Loan  Commitment then in effect and
               (2) to give  effect to the  limitations  set forth in the  second
               paragraph of Section 2.1A(ii).

               (iv)  Application of Prepayments  and  Unscheduled  Reductions of
               Revolving Loan Commitments.

                    (a)  Application  of Voluntary  Prepayments by Type of Loan.
               Any voluntary prepayments pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be
               applied as  specified  by  Borrower in the  applicable  notice of
               prepayment;  provided that in the event Borrower fails to specify
               the Loans to which any such  prepayment  shall be  applied,  such
               prepayment shall be applied first to repay outstanding  Revolving

                                       26
<PAGE>

               Loans to the full extent thereof on a pro rata basis,  and second
               to repay outstanding Term Loans on a pro rata basis.

                    (b)  Application of Mandatory  Prepayments by Type of Loans.
               Any amount  (the  "Applied  Amount")  required to be applied as a
               mandatory  prepayment  of the  Loans  and/or a  reduction  of the
               Revolving    Loan    Commitments    pursuant    to    subsections
               2.4B(iii)(a)-(d)  shall be applied to first prepay the Term Loans
               and Revolving  Loans then  outstanding on a pro rata basis to the
               full  extent  thereof  (and to  further  permanently  reduce  the
               Revolving Loan  Commitments  by the amount of such  prepayment of
               Revolving  Loans),  and  second,  to the extent of any  remaining
               portion of the Applied Amount, to further  permanently reduce the
               Revolving Loan Commitments to the full extent thereof.

                    (c)  Application  of  Prepayments  to Base  Rate  Loans  and
               Eurodollar   Rate  Loans.   Considering   Loans   being   prepaid
               separately, any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to Base
               Rate  Loans to the full  extent  thereof  before  application  to
               Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  in each case in a manner which minimizes
               the  amount  of any  payments  required  to be made  by  Borrower
               pursuant to subsection 2.6D.

                    C. General Provisions Regarding Payments.

                    (i) Manner and Time of Payment.  All payments by Borrower of
                    principal,  interest,  fees and other Obligations  hereunder
                    and  under the Notes  shall be made in  Dollars  in same day
                    funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim,  free of any
                    restriction  or condition,  and delivered to  Administrative
                    Agent not later  than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
                    date due at the Funding  and Payment  Office for the account
                    of Lenders;  funds  received by  Administrative  Agent after
                    that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid
                    by Borrower on the next  succeeding  Business Day.  Borrower
                    hereby  authorizes   Administrative   Agent  to  charge  its
                    accounts with Administrative  Agent in order to cause timely
                    payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal,
                    interest,  fees  and  expenses  due  hereunder  (subject  to
                    sufficient  funds being  available  in its accounts for that
                    purpose).

                    (ii) Application of Payments to Principal and Interest.  All
                    payments  in  respect  of the  principal  amount of any Loan
                    shall include  payment of accrued  interest on the principal
                    amount being repaid or prepaid,  and all such payments shall
                    be applied to the payment of interest before  application to
                    principal.

                    (iii)  Apportionment  of Payments.  Aggregate  principal and
                    interest  payments  in respect  of Term Loans and  Revolving
                    Loans shall be apportioned  among all  outstanding  Loans to
                    which  such  payments  relate  proportionately  to  Lenders'
                    respective  Pro  Rata  Shares.  Administrative  Agent  shall
                    promptly  distribute to each Lender,  at its primary address
                    set forth below its name on the  appropriate  signature page
                    hereof or at such other  address as such Lender may request,
                    its  Pro  Rata  Share  of  all  such  payments  received  by
                    Administrative  Agent and the commitment fees of such Lender
                    when received by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection
                    2.3.   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions  of  this
                    subsection  2.4C(iii),  if,  pursuant to the  provisions  of
                    subsection  2.6C, any Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  is
                    withdrawn  as to any  Affected  Lender  or if  any  Affected
                    Lender  makes  Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share
                    of any  Eurodollar  Rate Loans,  Administrative  Agent shall
                    give  effect  thereto  in  apportioning   payments  received
                    thereafter.

                    (iv) Payments on Business  Days.  Whenever any payment to be
                    made  hereunder  shall be  stated to be due on a day that is
                    not a Business  Day,  such payment shall be made on the next
                    succeeding  Business Day and such extension of time shall be
                    included  in the  computation  of the  payment  of  interest
                    hereunder or of the commitment fees  hereunder,  as the case
                    may be.

                    (v) Notation of Payment. Lender agrees that before disposing
                    of any Note held by it, or any part  thereof  (other than by
                    granting  participations   therein),   Lender  will  make  a
                    notation thereon of all Loans evidenced by that Note and all
                    principal  payments  previously made thereon and of the date





                                       27
<PAGE>

                    to which interest  thereon has been paid;  provided that the
                    failure  to make (or any error in the  making of) a notation
                    of any  Loan  made  under  such  Note  shall  not  limit  or
                    otherwise  affect the  obligations of Borrower  hereunder or
                    under such Note with  respect to any Loan or any payments of
                    principal or interest on such Note.

2.5       Use of Proceeds.
---       ----------------

               A. Loans.  The proceeds of the Loans shall be applied by Borrower
for (i)  predevelopment  of the Land for  Phase  II,  interest,  fees and  other
obligations  hereunder  (ii)  transaction  costs  related  to  the  transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) other general corporate purposes,  including loans
and distributions to Affiliates permitted under Section 7.3 or 7.5 hereof.

               B.  Margin  Regulations.  No  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  any
borrowing  under  this  Agreement  shall  be  used  by  Borrower  or  any of its
Subsidiaries  in any manner that might cause the borrowing or the application of
such proceeds to violate Regulation U, Regulation T or Regulation X of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board
or to violate the  Exchange  Act, in each case as in effect on the date or dates
of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

2.6       Special Provisions Governing Eurodollar Rate Loans.
---       ---------------------------------------------------

               Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this  Agreement  to the
contrary,  the following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate
Loans as to the matters covered:

               A.  Determination  of  Applicable   Interest  Rate.  As  soon  as
practicable  after  10:00  A.M.  (New  York  City  time) on each  Interest  Rate
Determination Date,  Administrative  Agent shall determine (which  determination
shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties)
the  interest  rate that shall apply to the  Eurodollar  Rate Loans for which an
interest rate is then being  determined for the applicable  Interest  Period and
shall  promptly  give notice  thereof (in writing or by  telephone  confirmed in
writing) to Borrower and each Lender.

               B. Inability to Determine  Applicable Interest Rate. In the event
that  Administrative  Agent shall have determined (which  determination shall be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto),  on any Interest Rate
Determination  Date with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, that by reason of
circumstances  affecting the interbank Eurodollar market adequate and fair means
do not exist for  ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the
basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, Administrative
Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed
in writing) to Borrower and each Lender of such determination,  whereupon (i) no
Loans may be made as, or converted to,  Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as
Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and Lenders that the circumstances giving
rise to such notice no longer  exist and (ii) any Notice of  Borrowing or Notice
of  Conversion/Continuation  given by  Borrower  with  respect  to the  Loans in
respect  of which  such  determination  was made shall be deemed to be made with
respect to Base Rate Loans.

               C.  Illegality or  Impracticability  of Eurodollar Rate Loans. In
the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which determination
shall be final and  conclusive  and binding upon all parties hereto but shall be
made only after  consultation with Borrower and  Administrative  Agent) that the
making,  maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become
unlawful  as a result of  compliance  by such Lender in good faith with any law,
treaty,  governmental rule, regulation,  guideline or order not in effect on the
date such  Person  became a Lender  (or  would  conflict  with any such  treaty,
governmental  rule,  regulation,  guideline or order not having the force of law
even  though the failure to comply  therewith  would not be  unlawful),  or (ii)
would cause  Lender  material  financial  hardship as a result of  contingencies
occurring after the date of this Agreement which materially and adversely affect
the interbank  Eurodollar  market or the position of such Lender in that market,
then,  and in any such event,  such Lender shall be an "Affected  Lender" and it
shall on that day give notice (by  telefacsimile  or by  telephone  confirmed in
writing) to  Borrower  and  Administrative  Agent of such  determination  (which
notice  Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  transmit  to each other  Lender).
Thereafter  (a) the  obligation  of the Affected  Lender to make Loans as, or to
convert  Loans to,  Eurodollar  Rate Loans shall be suspended  until such notice
shall be withdrawn by the Affected  Lender (which such Affected  Lender shall do
at the earliest  practicable  date), (b) to the extent such determination by the
Affected  Lender  relates  to a  Eurodollar  Rate Loan then being  requested  by
Borrower    pursuant   to   a   Notice   of    Borrowing    or   a   Notice   of
Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert
such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan,  (c) the  Affected  Lender's
obligation  to maintain its  outstanding  Eurodollar  Rate Loans (the  "Affected
Loans")  shall be  terminated  at the earlier to occur of the  expiration of the
Interest  Period  then in effect  with  respect  to the  Affected  Loans or when
required by law, and (d) the  Affected  Loans shall  automatically  convert into


                                       28
<PAGE>

Base  Rate  Loans on the date of such  termination.  Except as  provided  in the
immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection 2.6C shall affect the
obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans
as, or to convert Loans to,  Eurodollar  Rate Loans in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

               D.  Compensation  For  Breakage or  Non-Commencement  of Interest
Periods.  Borrower shall  compensate  each Lender,  upon written request by that
Lender (which  request shall set forth the basis for  requesting  such amounts),
for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid
by that  Lender  to  lenders  of  funds  borrowed  by it to make  or  carry  its
Eurodollar  Rate Loans and any loss,  expense  or  liability  sustained  by that
Lender in connection with the liquidation or  re-employment of such funds) which
that  Lender may  sustain:  (i) if for any reason  (other than a default by that
Lender)  a  borrowing  of any  Eurodollar  Rate  Loan  does not  occur on a date
specified  therefor  in a  Notice  of  Borrowing  or a  telephonic  request  for
borrowing,  as applicable,  or a conversion to or continuation of any Eurodollar
Rate  Loan  does  not  occur  on  a  date  specified  therefor  in a  Notice  of
Conversion/Continuation  or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation,
(ii) if any prepayment  (including any prepayment pursuant to subsection 2.4) or
other  principal  payment or any conversion of any of its Eurodollar  Rate Loans
occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period  applicable to that
Loan, (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on
any date  specified in a notice of  prepayment  given by Borrower,  or (iv) as a
consequence  of any other default by Borrower in the repayment of its Eurodollar
Rate Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement.

               E. Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Any Lender may make,  carry
or  transfer  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans at,  to, or for the  account of any of its
branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of that Lender.

               F.  Assumptions  Concerning  Funding of  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans.
Calculation  of all amounts  payable to a Lender under this  subsection  2.6 and
under  subsection  2.7A shall be made as though that Lender had actually  funded
each of its relevant  Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar
deposit  bearing  interest  at the rate  obtained  pursuant to clause (i) of the
definition of Adjusted  Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such
Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity  comparable to the relevant  Interest
Period and through  the  transfer of such  Eurodollar  deposit  from an offshore
office of that Lender to a domestic  office of that Lender in the United  States
of America; provided,  however, that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar
Rate  Loans in any  manner it sees fit and the  foregoing  assumptions  shall be
utilized  only for the  purposes  of  calculating  amounts  payable  under  this
subsection 2.6 and under subsection 2.7A.

               G. Eurodollar  Rate Loans After Default.  After the occurrence of
and  during  the  continuation  of a  Potential  Event of Default or an Event of
Default,  (i) Borrower may not elect to have a Loan be made or maintained as, or
converted to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan after the expiration of any Interest Period
then in effect for that Loan and (ii) subject to the  provisions  of  subsection
2.6D,  any Notice of  Borrowing  or Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  given by
Borrower with respect to a requested borrowing or  conversion/continuation  that
has not yet occurred shall be deemed made with respect to Base Rate Loans.

2.7       Increased Costs; Taxes; Capital Adequacy.
---       -----------------------------------------

               A.  Compensation  for Increased  Costs and Taxes.  Subject to the
provisions of subsection  2.7B (which shall be  controlling  with respect to the
matters covered  thereby),  in the event that any Lender shall determine  (which
determination  shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding
upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental  rule,  regulation
or order,  or any change  therein or in the  interpretation,  administration  or
application  thereof  (including  the  introduction  of any new law,  treaty  or
governmental  rule,  regulation or order),  or any  determination  of a court or
governmental  authority,  in each case  that  becomes  effective  after the date
hereof,  or compliance by such Lender with any  guideline,  request or directive
issued or made after the date hereof by any central  bank or other  governmental
or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law):

               (i) subjects such Lender (or its  applicable  lending  office) to
               any  additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income
               of such  Lender)  with  respect to this  Agreement  or any of its
               obligations  hereunder  or any  payments  to such  Lender (or its
               applicable  lending office) of principal,  interest,  fees or any
               other amount payable hereunder;

               (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including
               any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve),
               special  deposit,  compulsory  loan,  FDIC  insurance  or similar
               requirement   against  assets  held  by,  or  deposits  or  other
               liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or
               other credit  extended by, or any other  acquisition of funds by,
               any office of such Lender  (other than any such  reserve or other
               requirements  with  respect  to  Eurodollar  Rate  Loans that are
               reflected in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or

                                       29
<PAGE>

               (iii) imposes any other  condition  (other than with respect to a
               Tax  matter)  on or  affecting  such  Lender  (or its  applicable
               lending  office) or its  obligations  hereunder or the  interbank
               Eurodollar market;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make,  making or maintaining Loans hereunder or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Lender (or its  applicable  lending  office) with
respect  thereto;  then, in any such case,  Borrower  shall promptly pay to such
Lender,  upon receipt of the statement  referred to in the next  sentence,  such
additional  amount  or  amounts  (in the  form of an  increased  rate  of,  or a
different  method of  calculating,  interest or  otherwise as such Lender in its
sole discretion  shall  determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender
for any such  increased  cost or  reduction  in amounts  received or  receivable
hereunder.  Such Lender shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative
Agent) a written  statement,  setting forth in  reasonable  detail the basis for
calculating  the  additional  amounts owed to such Lender under this  subsection
2.7A,  which  statement  shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
absent manifest error.

               B. Withholding of Taxes.

               (i)  Payments to Be Free and Clear.  All sums payable by Borrower
               under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents  shall (except
               to the  extent  required  by law) be paid free and clear of,  and
               without  any  deduction  or  withholding  on account  of, any Tax
               (other  than a Tax on  the  overall  net  income  of any  Lender)
               imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the
               United  States of America or any political  subdivision  in or of
               the United States of America or any other jurisdiction from or to
               which a payment  is made by or on behalf  of  Borrower  or by any
               federation or  organization of which the United States of America
               or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment,  all
               such non-excluded Taxes being hereinafter  collectively  referred
               to as "Included Taxes".

               (ii) Grossing-up of Payments.  If Borrower or any other Person is
               required by law to make any deduction or  withholding  on account
               of any such Included Tax from any sum paid or payable by Borrower
               to  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  under  any of the Loan
               Documents:

                    (a) Borrower shall notify  Administrative  Agent of any such
               requirement  or any  change  in any such  requirement  as soon as
               Borrower becomes aware of it;

                    (b) Borrower shall pay any such Included Tax before the date
               on which penalties  attach  thereto,  such payment to be made (if
               the  liability to pay is imposed on Borrower) for its own account
               or (if that liability is imposed on Administrative  Agent or such
               Lender,  as the  case  may be) on  behalf  of and in the  name of
               Administrative Agent or such Lender;

                    (c) the sum  payable  by  Borrower  in  respect of which the
               relevant  deduction,  withholding or payment is required shall be
               increased  to the  extent  necessary  to ensure  that,  after the
               making of that deduction,  withholding or payment, Administrative
               Agent or such Lender, as the case may be receives on the due date
               a net sum  equal  to  what it  would  have  received  had no such
               deduction, withholding or payment been required or made; and

                    (d)  within 30 days  after  paying  any sum from which it is
               required by law to make any deduction or withholding,  and within
               30 days after the due date of payment of any  Included  Tax which
               it is required by clause (b) above to pay, Borrower shall deliver
               to  Administrative  Agent  evidence  satisfactory  to  the  other
               affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and of
               the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority;

provided  that no such  additional  amount  shall be  required to be paid to any
Lender  under  clause (c) above  except to the extent that any change  after the
date hereof (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or
after the date of the  Assignment  Agreement  or joinder  agreement  pursuant to
which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender) in any such
requirement  for a deduction,  withholding  or payment as is  mentioned  therein
shall  result  in an  increase  in the rate of such  deduction,  withholding  or
payment from that in effect at the date of this Agreement or at the date of such
Assignment  Agreement  or joinder  agreement,  as the case may be, in respect of
payments to such Lender.

               (iii) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax.

                    (a) Each  Lender  that is  organized  under  the laws of any
               jurisdiction  other than the United  States or any state or other
               political  subdivision  thereof (for purposes of this  subsection

               Date (in the  case of a  Lender  listed  on the  signature  pages
               hereof) or on or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement or
               joinder  agreement  pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the
               case of each  other  Lender)  and at such  other  times as may be
               necessary  in the  determination  of Borrower  or  Administrative
               Agent (each in the reasonable  exercise of its  discretion),  (1)
               two original  copies of Internal  Revenue  Service Form W-8BEN or
               W-8ECI (or any  successor  forms),  properly  completed  and duly
               executed by such Lender,  together with any other  certificate or
               statement of exemption required under the Code or the regulations
               issued thereunder to establish that such Lender is not subject to
               deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
               respect to any  payments to such Lender of  principal,  interest,
               fees or other amounts  payable under any of the Loan Documents or
               (2) if such Lender is not a "bank" or other  Person  described in
               Section  881(c)(3) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal
               Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 pursuant to clause (1) above, a
               Certificate re: Non-Bank Status together with two original copies
               of  Internal  Revenue  Service  Form  W-8BEN  or  W-8ECI  (or any
               successor  form),  properly  completed  and duly executed by such
               Lender,  together  with any other  certificate  or  statement  of
               exemption  required  under  the  Code or the  regulations  issued
               thereunder  to  establish  that  such  Lender is not  subject  to
               deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
               respect to any payments to such Lender of interest  payable under
               any of the Loan Documents.

                    (b) Each Lender required to deliver any forms,  certificates
               or other  evidence with respect to United States  federal  income
               tax  withholding  matters  pursuant  to  subsection  2.7B(iii)(a)
               hereby  agrees,  from time to time after the initial  delivery by
               such  Lender  of such  forms,  certificates  or  other  evidence,
               whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances  renders such
               forms,  certificates or other evidence  obsolete or inaccurate in
               any material  respect,  that Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to
               Administrative   Agent  for  transmission  to  Borrower  two  new
               original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, or
               a  Certificate  re  Non-Bank  Status and two  original  copies of
               Internal  Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI,  as the case may
               be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together
               with any other certificate or statement of exemption  required in
               order to confirm or establish  that such Lender is not subject to
               deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
               respect to payments to such Lender  under the Loan  Documents  or
               (2) notify  Administrative Agent and Borrower of its inability to
               deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence.

               (c) Borrower shall not be required to pay any  additional  amount
to any Non-US  Lender  under  clause (c) of  subsection  2.7B(ii) if such Lender
shall have  failed to satisfy the  requirements  of clause (a) or (b)(1) of this
subsection  2.7B(iii);  provided  that if such Lender shall have  satisfied  the
requirements of subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) on the Closing Date (in the case of each
Lender  listed on the signature  pages hereof) or on the date of the  Assignment
Agreement or joinder agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender (in the case
of each other Lender),  nothing in this  subsection  2.7B(iii)(c)  shall relieve
Borrower of its obligation to pay any additional  amounts pursuant to clause (c)
of  subsection  2.7B(ii)  in the event  that,  as a result of any  change in any
applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,  regulation or order, or any change
in the interpretation,  administration or application thereof, such Lender is no
longer properly  entitled to deliver forms,  certificates or other evidence at a
subsequent  date  establishing  the fact that  such  Lender  is not  subject  to
withholding as described in subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).

               C.  Capital  Adequacy  Adjustment.   If  any  Lender  shall  have
determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the
date hereof of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision  thereof) regarding
capital   adequacy,   or  any  change  therein  or  in  the   interpretation  or
administration  thereof  after the date  hereof by any  governmental  authority,
central  bank  or  comparable   agency  charged  with  the   interpretation   or
administration  thereof,  or compliance by any Lender (or its applicable lending
office) with any  guideline,  request or directive  regarding  capital  adequacy
(whether  or not  having the force of law) of any such  governmental  authority,
central bank or comparable  agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender as a  consequence  of,  or with  reference  to,  such  Lender's  Loans or
Commitments or Letters of Credit or participations  therein or other obligations
hereunder  with  respect to the Loans or the  Letters of Credit to a level below
that which such Lender or such controlling  corporation  could have achieved but
for such adoption, effectiveness,  phase-in, applicability, change or compliance
(taking  into  consideration  the  policies of such  Lender or such  controlling
corporation  with regard to capital  adequacy),  then from time to time,  within
five  Business  Days after receipt by Borrower from such Lender of the statement
referred  to in the  next  sentence,  Borrower  shall  pay to such  Lender  such
additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling
corporation on an after-tax basis for such reduction.  Such Lender shall deliver

                                       31
<PAGE>

to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative  Agent) a written statement,  setting
forth in  reasonable  detail  the basis of the  calculation  of such  additional
amounts, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
absent manifest error.

2.8       Obligation of Lenders to Mitigate.
---       ----------------------------------

               Each  Lender and  Issuing  Lender  agrees  that,  as  promptly as
practicable  after the officer of such Lender or Issuing Lender  responsible for
administering  the Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing  Lender,
as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence
of a  condition  that  would  cause such  Lender or Issuing  Lender to become an
Affected  Lender or that would entitle such Lender or Issuing  Lender to receive
payments  under  subsection  2.7 or  subsection  3.6 it will,  to the extent not
inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender or Issuing Lender and any
applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make,
issue,  fund or maintain the Commitments of such Lender or Issuing Lender or the
affected  Loans or Letters of Credit of such  Lender or Issuing  Lender  through
another  lending office of such Lender or Issuing Lender or (ii) take such other
measures as such Lender or Issuing  Lender may deem  reasonable,  if as a result
thereof the  circumstances  which  would cause such Lender or Issuing  Lender to
become an Affected  Lender would cease to exist or the additional  amounts which
would  otherwise  be required to be paid to Lender  pursuant to  subsection  2.7
would be  materially  reduced  and if, as  determined  by such Lender or Issuing
Lender in its sole discretion,  the making,  issuing,  funding or maintaining of
such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit through such other lending office
or in  accordance  with  such  other  measures,  as the case may be,  would  not
otherwise  materially  adversely  affect such Commitments or Loans or Letters of
Credit or the  interests of such Lender or Issuing  Lender;  provided  that such
Lender or Issuing  Lender will not be obligated  to utilize  such other  lending
office  pursuant to this  subsection  2.8 if such Lender or Issuing Lender would
incur incremental expenses as a result of utilizing such other lending office as
described  in clause  (i)  above.  A  certificate  as to the  amount of any such
expenses  payable by Borrower  pursuant to this subsection 2.8 (setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender
or Issuing  Lender to Borrower  shall (with a copy to  Administrative  Agent) be
conclusive  absent manifest error. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that it
will not request compensation under subsection 2.7 unless such Lender or Issuing
Lender requests  compensation  from borrowers  under other lending  arrangements
with such Lender or Issuing Lender who are similarly situated.

Section 3.     LETTERS OF CREDIT

3.1       Issuance of Letters of Credit and Lenders' Purchase of Participations
---       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
          Therein.
          --------

               A.  Letters of Credit.  In addition to Borrower  requesting  that
Lenders make  Revolving  Loans  pursuant to  subsection  2.1A(ii),  Borrower may
request,  in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1, from time to
time during the period  from the  Closing  Date to the date ninety days prior to
the Revolving Loan Commitment  Termination Date, that one or more Lenders with a
Revolving  Loan  Commitment  issue Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower
for the purposes  specified in the  definitions of Commercial  Letters of Credit
and  Standby  Letters of Credit.  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the  representations  and  warranties of Borrower
herein set forth,  any one or more Lender with a Revolving Loan  Commitment may,
but (except as provided in subsection 3.1B(ii)) shall not be obligated to, issue
such Letters of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1;
provided  that  Borrower  shall not request that any Lender issue (and no Lender
shall issue):

               (i)  any  Letter  of  Credit  if,  after  giving  effect  to such
               issuance,  the Total  Utilization  of Revolving  Loan  Commitment
               would exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect;

               (ii) any  Letter  of  Credit  if,  after  giving  effect  to such
               issuance, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $16,500,000;

               (iii) any  Standby  Letter of Credit  having an  expiration  date
               later  than the  earlier  of (a) the  Revolving  Loan  Commitment
               Termination Date and (b) the date which is one year from the date
               of issuance of such Standby  Letter of Credit;  provided that the
               immediately  preceding  clause  (b)  shall  not  prevent  (x) the
               Issuing  Lender for the Phase I LOC from  issuing  such Letter of
               Credit  with an  expiration  date of October  31, 2002 or (y) any
               Issuing Lender from agreeing that a Standby Letter of Credit will
               automatically be extended for one or more successive  periods not
               to exceed one year each unless such Issuing  Lender elects not to
               extend for any such additional period; and provided, further that
               such Issuing Lender shall elect not to extend such Standby Letter
               of  Credit  if it has  knowledge  that an  Event of  Default  has



                                       32
<PAGE>

               occurred and is continuing (and has not been waived in accordance
               subsection  10.6) at the time  such  Issuing  Lender  must  elect
               whether or not to allow such extension;

               (iv) any  Commercial  Letter of Credit having an expiration  date
               (a) later than the earlier of (X) the date which is 30 days prior
               to the Revolving  Loan  Commitment  Termination  Date and (Y) the
               date  which  is 180  days  from  the  date  of  issuance  of such
               Commercial Letter of Credit or (b) that is otherwise unacceptable
               to the applicable Issuing Lender in its reasonable discretion; or

               (v) any Letter of Credit  denominated  in a  currency  other than
               Dollars.

               B. Mechanics of Issuance.

               (i) Notice of Issuance. Whenever Borrower desires the issuance of
               a Letter of Credit,  it shall deliver to  Administrative  Agent a
               Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit  substantially in the form
               of Exhibit  IX annexed  hereto no later than 12:00 Noon (New York
               City time) at least three  Business  Days (in the case of Standby
               Letters  of  Credit)  or  five  Business  Days  (in  the  case of
               Commercial  Letters  of  Credit),  or in each case  such  shorter
               period  as  may  be  agreed  to by  the  Issuing  Lender  in  any
               particular instance, in advance of the proposed date of issuance.
               The Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit shall  specify (a) the
               proposed date of issuance  (which shall be a Business  Day),  (b)
               whether the Letter of Credit is to be a Standby  Letter of Credit
               or a  Commercial  Letter of  Credit,  (c) the face  amount of the
               Letter  of  Credit,  (d) the  expiration  date of the  Letter  of
               Credit,  (e) the name and  address  of the  beneficiary,  and (f)
               either the verbatim text of the proposed  Letter of Credit or the
               proposed  terms  and  conditions  thereof,  including  a  precise
               description  of any documents to be presented by the  beneficiary
               which,  if presented by the  beneficiary  prior to the expiration
               date of the Letter of Credit, would require the Issuing Lender to
               make  payment  under the  Letter  of  Credit;  provided  that the
               Issuing Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may require changes
               in  the  text  of the  proposed  Letter  of  Credit  or any  such
               documents;  and provided,  further that no Letter of Credit shall
               require payment against a conforming  draft to be made thereunder
               on the same business day (under the laws of the  jurisdiction  in
               which the  office of the  Issuing  Lender to which  such draft is
               required to be presented is located) that such draft is presented
               if such  presentation  is made after 10:00 A.M. (in the time zone
               of such office of the Issuing Lender) on such business day.

               Borrower  shall  notify  the   applicable   Issuing  Lender  (and
               Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such Issuing
               Lender)  prior to the  issuance  of any  Letter  of Credit in the
               event that any of the  matters to which  Borrower  is required to
               certify in the applicable  Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit
               is no longer true and correct as of the proposed date of issuance
               of such Letter of Credit,  and upon the issuance of any Letter of
               Credit Borrower shall be deemed to have  re-certified,  as of the
               date of such  issuance,  as to the  matters to which  Borrower is
               required  to  certify in the  applicable  Notice of  Issuance  of
               Letter of Credit.

               (ii)   Determination   of  Issuing   Lender.   Upon   receipt  by
               Administrative  Agent of a Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit
               pursuant  to  subsection  3.1B(i)  requesting  the  issuance of a
               Letter of Credit,  in the event  Administrative  Agent  elects to
               issue such Letter of Credit,  Administrative Agent shall promptly
               so notify Borrower, and Administrative Agent shall be the Issuing
               Lender with  respect  thereto.  In the event that  Administrative
               Agent, in its sole discretion, elects not to issue such Letter of
               Credit,  Administrative  Agent shall promptly so notify Borrower,
               whereupon  Borrower may request any other Lender with a Revolving
               Loan  Commitment  to issue such Letter of Credit by delivering to
               such Lender a copy of the applicable Notice of Issuance of Letter
               of Credit. Any Lender so requested to issue such Letter of Credit
               shall promptly notify Borrower and  Administrative  Agent whether
               or not,  in its sole  discretion,  it has  elected  to issue such
               Letter of Credit,  and any such  Lender  which so elects to issue
               such Letter of Credit  shall be the Issuing  Lender with  respect
               thereto.  In the event that all other Lenders with Revolving Loan
               Commitments  shall have  declined to issue such Letter of Credit,
               notwithstanding the prior election of Administrative Agent not to
               issue such Letter of Credit,  so long as all other conditions set
               forth in this Agreement for issuance of such Letter of Credit are
               satisfied,  Administrative Agent shall be obligated to issue such
               Letter of Credit and shall be the  Issuing  Lender  with  respect
               thereto, notwithstanding the fact that the Letter of Credit Usage
               with  respect to such  Letter of Credit  and with  respect to all
               other  Letters of Credit  issued by  Administrative  Agent,  when

                                       33
<PAGE>

               aggregated  with  Administrative  Agent's  outstanding  Revolving
               Loans,   may  exceed   Administrative   Agent's   Revolving  Loan
               Commitment then in effect.

               (iii) Issuance of Letter of Credit.  Upon  satisfaction or waiver
               (in accordance with subsection  10.6) of the conditions set forth
               in subsection  4.3, the Issuing  Lender shall issue the requested
               Letter of Credit in accordance with the Issuing Lender's standard
               operating procedures.

               (iv) Notification to Lenders.  Upon the issuance of any Letter of
               Credit  the  applicable  Issuing  Lender  shall  promptly  notify
               Administrative  Agent and each other Lender with a Revolving Loan
               Commitment of such issuance, which notice shall be accompanied by
               a copy of such Letter of Credit.  Promptly  after receipt of such
               notice  (or,  if  Administrative  Agent  is the  Issuing  Lender,
               together  with such  notice),  Administrative  Agent shall notify
               each  Lender with a Revolving  Loan  Commitment  of the amount of
               such Lender's respective  participation in such Letter of Credit,
               determined in accordance with subsection 3.1C.

               (v)  Reports  to  Lenders.  Within 15 days  after the end of each
               calendar  quarter  ending after the Closing  Date, so long as any
               Letter of Credit shall have been outstanding during such calendar
               quarter,  each Issuing  Lender shall deliver to each other Lender
               with a Revolving Loan  Commitment a report setting forth for such
               calendar quarter the daily aggregate amount available to be drawn
               under the Letters of Credit  issued by such  Issuing  Lender that
               were outstanding during such calendar quarter.

               C.  Lenders'  Purchase  of  Participations  in Letters of Credit.
Immediately  upon the  issuance  of each  Letter of Credit,  each  Lender with a
Revolving  Loan  Commitment  shall be deemed  to, and  hereby  agrees  to,  have
irrevocably  purchased from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of
Credit and any drawings  honored  thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's
Pro  Rata  Share of the  maximum  amount  which  is or at any  time  may  become
available to be drawn thereunder.

3.2       Letter of Credit Fees.
---       ----------------------

               Borrower  agrees to pay the  following  amounts  with  respect to

3.3       Drawings and Reimbursement of Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.
---       -------------------------------------------------------------------

               A. Responsibility of Issuing Lender With Respect to Drawings.  In
determining  whether  to honor any  drawing  under  any  Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary  thereof,  Issuing Lender shall be  responsible  only to examine the
documents  delivered  under such Letter of Credit with  reasonable care so as to
ascertain  whether they appear on their face to be in accordance  with the terms
and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

               B.  Reimbursement  by Borrower of Amounts  Paid Under  Letters of
Credit. In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a
Letter of Credit  issued by it, such  Issuing  Lender shall  immediately  notify
Borrower and  Administrative  Agent,  and Borrower shall  reimburse such Issuing
Lender on or before the Business  Day  immediately  following  the date on which
such drawing is honored (the  "Reimbursement  Date") in an amount in Dollars and
in same day funds equal to the amount of such honored  drawing;  provided  that,
anything  contained in this  Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding,  unless
Borrower shall have notified  Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender prior
to 10:00  A.M.  (New York City time) on the date such  drawing  is honored  that
Borrower intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored
drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Loans, Borrower shall be
deemed  to have  given a timely  Notice of  Borrowing  to  Administrative  Agent
requesting  Lenders  to make  Revolving  Loans  that are Base Rate  Loans on the
Reimbursement  Date in an amount in Dollars  equal to the amount of such honored
drawing and Lenders with Revolving Loan Commitments  shall, on the Reimbursement
Date,  make  Revolving  Loans  that are Base  Rate  Loans in the  amount of such
honored   drawing,   the  proceeds  of  which  shall  be  applied   directly  by
Administrative  Agent to reimburse  such  Issuing  Lender for the amount of such
honored  drawing;  and  provided,  further  that if for any reason  proceeds  of
Revolving  Loans are not  received by such Issuing  Lender on the  Reimbursement
Date in an amount equal to the amount of such honored  drawing,  Borrower  shall
reimburse such Issuing Lender,  on demand,  in an amount in same day funds equal
to the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of
such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so received.  Nothing in this subsection
3.3B shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Revolving
Loans on the terms and  conditions  set forth in this  Agreement,  and  Borrower
shall  retain any and all rights it may have against any Lender  resulting  from
the failure of such Lender to make such  Revolving  Loans under this  subsection
3.3B.

               C. Payment by Lenders of Unreimbursed  Amounts Paid Under Letters
of Credit.

               (i) Payment by Lenders. In the event that Borrower shall fail for
               any  reason  to  reimburse  any  Issuing  Lender as  provided  in
               subsection  3.3B in an amount  equal to the amount of any drawing
               honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by
               it, such Issuing Lender shall  promptly  notify each other Lender
               with a Revolving Loan  Commitment of the  unreimbursed  amount of
               such  honored  drawing  and of  such  other  Lender's  respective
               participation therein based on such Lender's Pro Rata Share. Each
               Lender with a Revolving Loan  Commitment  shall make available to
               such   Issuing   Lender  an  amount   equal  to  its   respective
               participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of
               such Issuing  Lender  specified  in such  notice,  not later than
               12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the first  business day (under
               the laws of the jurisdiction in which such office of such Issuing
               Lender  is  located)  after  the date  notified  by such  Issuing
               Lender.  In the  event  that any  Lender  with a  Revolving  Loan
               Commitment fails to make available to such Issuing Lender on such
               business day the amount of such  Lender's  participation  in such
               Letter  of Credit  as  provided  in this  subsection  3.3C,  such
               Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand
               from such  Lender  together  with  interest  thereon  at the rate
               customarily  used by such Issuing  Lender for the  correction  of
               errors among banks for three  Business Days and thereafter at the
               Base  Rate.  Nothing in this  subsection  3.3C shall be deemed to
               prejudice  the  right  of  any  Lender  with  a  Revolving   Loan
               Commitment  to recover  from any Issuing  Lender any amounts made
               available by such Lender to such Issuing Lender  pursuant to this
               subsection  3.3C in the event that it is  determined by the final
               judgment of a court of  competent  jurisdiction  that the payment
               with  respect  to a Letter of Credit  by such  Issuing  Lender in
               respect  of which  payment  was made by such  Lender  constituted
               gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  on the  part  of such
               Issuing Lender.

               (ii)  Distribution  to Lenders of  Reimbursements  Received  From
               Borrowers.  In the  event  any  Issuing  Lender  shall  have been
               reimbursed  by other Lenders  pursuant to subsection  3.3C(i) for
               all or any portion of any drawing  honored by such Issuing Lender

                                       35
<PAGE>

               under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing  Lender shall
               distribute to each other Lender with a Revolving Loan  Commitment
               which has paid all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i)
               with respect to such honored drawing such other Lender's Pro Rata
               Share  of all  payments  subsequently  received  by such  Issuing
               Lender from  Borrower in  reimbursement  of such honored  drawing
               when such payments are received.  Any such distribution  shall be
               made to a Lender at its primary  address set forth below its name
               on the appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address
               as such Lender may request.

               D. Interest on Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.

               (i) Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing  Lender,  with respect
               to drawings  honored  under any  Letters of Credit  issued by it,
               interest on the amount paid by such Issuing  Lender in respect of
               each such  honored  drawing from the date such drawing is honored
               to but  excluding  the date such amount is reimbursed by Borrower
               (including  any  such   reimbursement  out  of  the  proceeds  of
               Revolving  Loans pursuant to subsection  3.3B) at a rate equal to
               (a) for the period  from the date such  drawing is honored to but
               excluding the  Reimbursement  Date, the rate then in effect under
               this Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
               Loans and (b) thereafter,  a rate which is 2% per annum in excess
               of the rate of interest  otherwise  payable under this  Agreement
               with  respect  to  Revolving  Loans  that  are Base  Rate  Loans.
               Interest  payable  pursuant to this  subsection  3.3D(i) shall be
               computed on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual  number of
               days  elapsed in the period  during which it accrues and shall be
               payable on demand or, if no demand is made,  on the date on which
               the related  drawing  under a Letter of Credit is  reimbursed  in
               full.

               (ii)   Distribution  of  Interest  Payments  by  Issuing  Lender.
               Promptly  upon  receipt by any  Issuing  Lender of any payment of
               interest pursuant to subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a drawing
               honored  under a Letter of Credit  issued by it, (a) such Issuing
               Lender  shall  distribute  to each other  Lender with a Revolving
               Loan  Commitment,  out of the  interest  received by such Issuing
               Lender in  respect of the  period  from the date such  drawing is
               honored to but excluding the date on which such Issuing Lender is
               reimbursed  for the amount of such  drawing  (including  any such
               reimbursement  out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant to
               subsection  3.3B),  the amount that such other  Lender would have
               been  entitled  to receive in respect of the letter of credit fee
               that would have been  payable in respect of such Letter of Credit
               for such period pursuant to subsection 3.2 if no drawing had been
               honored  under such  Letter of Credit,  and (b) in the event such
               Issuing  Lender  shall  have  been  reimbursed  by other  Lenders
               pursuant  to  subsection  3.3C(i)  for all or any portion of such
               honored  drawing,  such Issuing  Lender shall  distribute to each
               other  Lender  which  has paid all  amounts  payable  by it under
               subsection  3.3C(i)  with  respect to such  honored  drawing such
               other  Lender's Pro Rata Share of any  interest  received by such
               Issuing Lender in respect of that portion of such honored drawing
               so  reimbursed  by other  Lenders for the period from the date on
               which such Issuing  Lender was so  reimbursed by other Lenders to
               but  excluding  the date on which such  portion  of such  honored
               drawing is reimbursed by Borrowers.  Any such distribution  shall
               be made to a Lender at its  primary  address  set forth below its
               name on the  appropriate  signature  page hereof or at such other
               address as such Lender may request.

3.4       Obligations Absolute.
---       ---------------------

               The  obligation of Borrower to reimburse  each Issuing Lender for
drawings  honored  under the  Letters  of  Credit  issued by it and to repay any
Revolving Loans made by Lenders  pursuant to subsection 3.3B and the obligations
of Lenders under subsection  3.3C(i) shall be unconditional  and irrevocable and
shall be paid strictly in accordance  with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

               Credit;

               (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off,  defense or other right
               which  Borrower  or any  Lender  may have at any time  against  a
               beneficiary  or any  transferee  of any  Letter of Credit (or any
               Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting),  any Issuing
               Lender or other  Lender  or any other  Person or in the case of a
               Lender,  against  Borrower,   whether  in  connection  with  this
               Agreement, the transactions  contemplated herein or any unrelated
               transaction   (including  any  underlying   transaction   between
               Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which
               any Letter of Credit was procured);

<PAGE>

               (iii) any draft or other document  presented  under any Letter of
               Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,  invalid or insufficient
               in  any  respect  or  any  statement   therein  being  untrue  or
               inaccurate in any respect;

               (iv) payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under any Letter of
               Credit  against  presentation  of a draft or other document which
               does not  substantially  comply  with the terms of such Letter of
               Credit;

               (v) any adverse change in the business,  operations,  properties,
               assets,  condition  (financial  or  otherwise)  or  prospects  of
               Borrower;

               (vi) any breach of this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document by
               any party thereto;

               (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,  whether or
               not similar to any of the foregoing; or

               (viii) the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential  Event of
               Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

provided,  in each case, that payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under the
applicable  Letter of Credit  shall not have  constituted  gross  negligence  or
willful  misconduct of such Issuing Lender under the  circumstances  in question
(as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

3.5       Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties.
---       ---------------------------------------------------

               A. Indemnification. In addition to amounts payable as provided in
subsection  3.6,  Borrower  hereby  agrees to protect,  indemnify,  pay and save
harmless  each  Issuing  Lender from and  against  any and all claims,  demands,
liabilities,  damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable
fees,  expenses and  disbursements  of counsel and  allocated  costs of internal
counsel)  which such Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence,
direct or indirect,  of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing
Lender, other than as a result of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Issuing Lender as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or (b) subject to the following clause (ii), the wrongful  dishonor
by such Issuing  Lender of a proper  demand for payment made under any Letter of
Credit  issued  by it or (ii) the  failure  of such  Issuing  Lender  to honor a
drawing  under any such  Letter  of  Credit as a result of any act or  omission,
whether  rightful  or  wrongful,  of any  present  or future de jure or de facto
government or governmental  authority (all such acts or omissions  herein called
"Governmental Acts").

               B. Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties. As between Borrower and any
Issuing  Lender,  Borrower  assumes all risks of the acts and  omissions  of, or
misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender by, the respective
beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing,  such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible  for: (i) the form,
validity,  sufficiency,  accuracy,  genuineness  or legal effect of any document
submitted by any party in connection  with the  application  for and issuance of
any such  Letter of Credit,  even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all
respects  invalid,  insufficient,  inaccurate,  fraudulent  or forged;  (ii) the
validity  or  sufficiency  of  any  instrument   transferring  or  assigning  or
purporting  to  transfer  or assign  any such  Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective  for any reason;  (iii) failure of the  beneficiary of
any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions  required in order
to draw upon such Letter of Credit;  (iv) errors,  omissions,  interruptions  or
delays in transmission or delivery of any messages,  by mail, cable,  telegraph,
telex  or  otherwise,   whether  or  not  they  be  in  cipher;  (v)  errors  in
interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or
otherwise  of any  document  required in order to make a drawing  under any such
Letter of Credit or of the proceeds  thereof;  (vii) the  misapplication  by the
beneficiary  of any such Letter of Credit of the  proceeds of any drawing  under
such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the
control of such Issuing Lender,  including  without  limitation any Governmental
Acts,  and none of the above shall affect or impair,  or prevent the vesting of,
any of such Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

               In  furtherance  and  extension  and  not  in  limitation  of the
specific  provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this  subsection  3.5B,
any action taken or omitted by any Issuing  Lender under or in  connection  with
the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and  certificates  delivered
thereunder,  if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put any Issuing Lender
under any resulting liability to Borrower.

               Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this
subsection 3.5, Borrower shall retain any and all rights it may have against any
Issuing Lender for any liability  arising solely out of the gross  negligence or
willful  misconduct of such Issuing Lender, as determined by a final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction.

3.6       Increased Costs and Taxes Relating to Letters of Credit.
---       --------------------------------------------------------

               Subject to the  provisions  of  subsection  2.7B (which  shall be
controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby),  in the event that any
Issuing Lender or Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment shall determine (which
determination  shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding
upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental  rule,  regulation
or order,  or any change  therein or in the  interpretation,  administration  or
application  thereof  (including  the  introduction  of any new law,  treaty  or
governmental  rule,  regulation or order),  or any  determination  of a court or
governmental  authority,  in each case  that  becomes  effective  after the date
hereof,  or  compliance  by any Issuing  Lender or Lender with a Revolving  Loan
Commitment  with any  guideline,  request or directive  issued or made after the
date  hereof by any central  bank or other  governmental  or  quasi-governmental
authority (whether or not having the force of law):

               (i)  subjects  such Issuing  Lender or Lender (or its  applicable
               lending or letter of credit  office) to any additional Tax (other
               than any Tax on the overall net income of such Issuing  Lender or
               Lender) with respect to the issuing or maintaining of any Letters
               of Credit or the purchasing or maintaining of any  participations
               therein or any other  obligations  under this  Section 3, whether
               directly  or  by  such  being  imposed  on  or  suffered  by  any
               particular Issuing Lender or Lender;

               (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including
               without limitation any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special
               or  other  reserve),  special  deposit,   compulsory  loan,  FDIC
               insurance  or similar  requirement  in respect of any  Letters of

               D. Binding  Obligation.  Each of the Loan  Documents  and Project
Documents  has been duly executed and delivered by Loan Parties that are parties

modifications,  supplements,  renewals or extensions  of any thereof)  affecting

regardless  of whether a Borrower or such  Subsidiary  is the landlord or tenant
(whether  directly or as an assignee or successor in interest) under such lease,
sublease or assignment. Except as specified in Schedule 5.5 annexed hereto, each
agreement listed in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is in full
force and effect and  Borrower  does not have  knowledge of any default that has
occurred and is continuing  thereunder,  and each such agreement constitutes the
legally valid and binding  obligation of each applicable  Borrower,  enforceable
against such Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium or similar laws
relating to or limiting  creditors' rights generally or by equitable  principles

governmental department,  commission,  board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign (including any Environmental Claims) that are pending or, to
the knowledge of Borrower,  threatened  against or affecting  Borrower or any of
its  Subsidiaries  or any  property of Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  and

or any federal, state, municipal or other governmental  department,  commission,

assessments,  fees and other  governmental  charges upon Borrower and upon their
respective properties,  assets, income,  businesses and franchises which are due

tax assessment  against Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  which is not being
actively  contested  by  Borrower  or  such  Subsidiary  in  good  faith  and by
appropriate  proceedings;  provided  that  such  reserves  or other  appropriate
provisions, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been

the performance,  observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants
or conditions contained in any of its Contractual Obligations,  and no condition
exists  that,  with the  giving of  notice  or the lapse of time or both,  would
constitute  such a default,  except  where the  consequences  of such default or
defaults, if any, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

B. Schedule 5.8 contains a true, correct and complete list of all the Material
Contracts in effect on the Closing Date. Except as described on Schedule 5.8,

regulation  under the Public  Utility  Holding  Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act, or the Interstate  Commerce Act or registration  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 or under any other  federal or state  statute or  regulation
which may limit its ability to incur  Indebtedness  other than the Nevada Gaming
Laws or  which  may  otherwise  render  all or any  portion  of the  Obligations

Plan for which the  actuarial  report is available,  the potential  liability of
Borrower,  its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete

               would have been delivered  pursuant to such  subdivisions  had no
               such change in accounting principles and policies been made, then
               together with the first delivery of financial statements pursuant

               course of their audit examination,  and (c) stating that based on
               their audit examination  nothing has come to their attention that
               causes  them to  believe  either  or both  that  the  information
               contained in the  certificates  delivered  therewith  pursuant to

               (xviii) Other Information: with reasonable promptness, such other
               information  and data  with  respect  to  Borrower  or any of its
               Subsidiaries as from time to time may be reasonably  requested by
               any Lender.

6.2       Corporate Existence, etc.
---       -------------------------


               Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at all
times  preserve  and keep in full force and effect  their  corporate  or limited
liability  company  existence  and all rights  and  franchises  material  to its
business provided that any Subsidiary of Borrower may be merged into Borrower or
another  wholly-owned  Subsidiary  of  Borrower  and  provided  further  that no
Subsidiary of Borrower shall be required to preserve any such right or franchise
if the Board of Directors (or managing  member  thereof,  if  applicable)  shall
determine (and shall notify Administrative Agent), that the preservation thereof
is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of such Subsidiary and the
loss thereof is not  disadvantageous in any material respect to Borrower and its
Subsidiaries or any Lender.

6.3       Payment of Taxes and Claims; Tax Consolidation.
---       -----------------------------------------------

               A. Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay
all material taxes,  assessments and other governmental  charges imposed upon it
or any  of  its  properties  or  assets  or in  respect  of  any of its  income,
businesses or franchises  before any penalty accrues  thereon,  and all material
claims (including claims for labor,  services,  materials and supplies) for sums
that have  become due and payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon
any of its  properties  or  assets,  prior to the time when any  penalty or fine
shall be incurred  with respect  thereto;  provided that no such charge or claim
need be paid if it is being  contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings
promptly  instituted  and diligently  conducted,  so long as (1) such reserve or
other  appropriate  provision,  if any, as shall be required in conformity  with
GAAP  shall  have  been made  therefor  and (2) in the case of a charge or claim
which has or may  become a Lien  against  any of the  Collateral,  such  contest
proceedings  conclusively  operate  to  stay  the  sale  of any  portion  of the
Collateral to satisfy such charge or claim.

               B. Borrower will not, nor will it permit any of its  Subsidiaries
to, file or consent to the filing of any consolidated income tax return with any
Person  (other than LVSI or any of its  Subsidiaries)  unless  Borrower  and its
Subsidiaries  shall have entered into, a tax sharing agreement with such Person,
in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent.

6.4       Maintenance of Properties; Insurance; Application of Net Loss
---       -------------------------------------------------------------
          Proceeds.
          ---------

               A. Maintenance of Properties.  Borrower will, and will cause each
of its  Subsidiaries  to,  maintain or cause to be  maintained  in good  repair,
working  order and  condition,  ordinary  wear and tear  excepted,  all material
properties used or useful in the business of Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  and
from  time to time  will  make or  cause  to be made  all  appropriate  repairs,
renewals  and  replacements  thereof  except  to the  extent  that the  Borrower
determines in good faith not to maintain, repair, renew or replace such property
if such property is no longer desirable in the conduct of their business and the
failure to do so is not  disadvantageous in any material respect to the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries or the Lenders.

               B.  Insurance.  Borrower will maintain or cause to be maintained,
with financially sound and reputable insurers,  such public liability insurance,
third party  property  damage  insurance,  business  interruption  insurance and
casualty  insurance with respect to liabilities,  losses or damage in respect of
the assets,  properties and businesses of Borrower,  and its Subsidiaries as may
customarily be carried or maintained under similar circumstances by corporations
of established  reputation engaged in similar  businesses,  in each case in such
amounts (giving effect to self-insurance),  with such deductibles, covering such
risks and  otherwise  on such terms and  conditions  as shall be  customary  for
corporations similarly situated in the industry. Without limiting the generality
of the  foregoing,  Borrower will  maintain or cause to be maintained  (i) flood
insurance with respect to the Mortgaged  Property that is located in a community
that  participates  in the National  Flood  Insurance  Program,  in each case in
compliance  with any  applicable  regulations  of the Board of  Governors of the
Federal Reserve System,  and (ii)  replacement  value casualty  insurance on the
Collateral under such policies of insurance,  with such insurance companies,  in
such amounts, with such deductibles, and covering such risks as are at all times
satisfactory to Administrative Agent in its commercially reasonable judgment, it
being understood,  however,  that Borrower shall not be required to maintain any
such  casualty  insurance if neither  Borrower nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has
insurable assets of any material value.  Each such policy of insurance shall (a)
name  Administrative  Agent as an additional insured thereunder as its interests
may  appear  and (b) in the  case of each  business  interruption  and  casualty
insurance policy, contain a loss payable clause or endorsement,  satisfactory in

                                       50
<PAGE>

form and substance to Administrative  Agent, that names  Administrative Agent as
the loss  payee  thereunder  for any  covered  loss in  excess of  $250,000  and
provides for at least 30 days prior written  notice to  Administrative  Agent of
any modification or cancellation of such policy.

               C. Application of Net Loss Proceeds and Liquidated Damages.

               (i) Upon receiving Loss Proceeds or Liquidated  Damages  Borrower
               shall (a) so long as no Event of  Default or  Potential  Event of
               Default shall have  occurred and be continuing  and the amount of
               Loss Proceeds and Liquidated Damages received by Borrower is less
               than $250,000, promptly and diligently apply the Loss Proceeds or
               Liquidated  Damages to pay or reimburse  the costs of  repairing,
               restoring or  replacing  the assets in respect of which such Loss
               Proceeds or  Liquidated  Damages were  received or, to the extent
               not so  applied,  to repay the Loans as  provided  in  subsection
               2.4B(iii)(b),  (b) if an Event of Default or  Potential  Event of
               Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing,  Borrower  shall
               apply an amount equal to such Loss Proceeds or Liquidated Damages
               to repay the Loans as provided in  Subsection  2.4B(iii)(b),  and
               (c) if the amount of Loss Proceeds or Liquidated Damages received
               by Borrower equals or exceeds $250,000 and no Event of Default or
               Potential  Event of Default shall have  occurred,  Borrower shall
               within two (2) Business Days of the receipt  thereof deposit such
               funds with Administrative Agent and, so long as Borrower proceeds
               diligently  to repair,  restore or replace the assets of Borrower
               in respect of which such Loss Proceeds or Liquidated Damages were
               received,  Administrative  Agent shall from time to time disburse
               to  Borrower  from such  account,  to the extent of any such Loss
               Proceeds or Liquidated  Damages  remaining  therein in respect of
               the applicable covered loss, amounts necessary to pay the cost of
               such  repair,  restoration  or  replacement  after the receipt by
               Administrative   Agent  or   invoices   or  other   documentation
               reasonably satisfactory to Lender relating to the amount of costs
               so incurred  and the work  performed  (including,  if required by
               Administrative    Agent   ,   lien   releases   and   architects'
               certificates);   provided,   however,   that   if  at  any   time
               Administrative  Agent reasonably  determines (A) that Borrower is
               not  proceeding  diligently  with  such  repair,  restoration  or
               replacement  or (B) that such repair,  restoration or replacement
               cannot be completed with the Loss Proceeds or Liquidated  Damages
               then held by  Administrative  Agent for such  purposes,  together
               with funds otherwise  available to Borrower for such purpose,  or
               that such repair,  restoration or replacement cannot be completed
               within 180 days after the receipt by Administrative Agent of such
               Loss Proceeds or Liquidated Damages,  Administrative Agent shall,
               and Borrower  hereby  authorizes  Administrative  Agent to, apply
               such Loss  Proceeds or  Liquidated  Damages to repay the Loans as
               provided in subsection 2.4B(iii)(b).

               (ii) Upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any Loss Proceeds as
               loss payee, or Liquidated  Damages in respect of any covered loss
               (a) and if and to the extent Borrower would have been required to
               apply  such  Loss  Proceeds  or  Liquidated  Damages  (if  it had
               received them directly) to repay the Loans,  Administrative Agent
               shall, and Borrower hereby  authorizes  Administrative  Agent to,
               apply such Loss Proceeds to Liquidated Damages to repay the Loans
               as provided in subsection 2.4B(iii)(b), and (b) to the extent the
               foregoing  clause (a) does not apply and (1) the aggregate amount
               of  such  Loss  Proceeds  or  Liquidated  Damages  received  (and
               reasonably  expected to be received) by  Administrative  Agent in
               respect  of any  covered  loss does not exceed  $250,000,  Lender
               shall  deliver  such  Loss  Proceeds  or  Liquidated  Damages  to
               Borrower, and Borrower shall promptly apply such Loss Proceeds or
               Liquidated  Damages  to the  cost  of  repairing,  restoring,  or
               replacing  the assets in respect of which such Loss  Proceeds  or
               Liquidated Damages were received, and (2) if the aggregate amount
               of Loss Proceeds or Liquidated  Damages  received (and reasonably
               expected to be  received) by  Administrative  Agent in respect of
               any covered  loss equals or exceeds  $250,000  Lender  shall hold

               not  proceeding  diligently  with  such  repair,  restoration  or
               replacement  or (B) that such repair,  restoration or replacement

          and Violations of Environmental Laws.
          -------------------------------------

               A. Environmental  Review and Investigation.  Borrower agrees that
Administrative  Agent may, from time to time and in its  reasonable  discretion,

review any environmental audits,  investigations,  analyses and reports relating
to Hazardous  Materials in respect of the Land, the Land or the Project prepared
by or for Borrower and (ii) conduct  their own  investigation  of any  Facility;
provided that, in the case of any Facility no longer owned, leased,  operated or
used by Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries or Affiliates,  Borrower shall only
be  obligated to use its best efforts to obtain  permission  for  Administrative
Agent's  professional  consultant to conduct an  investigation of such Facility.
For purposes of conducting such a review and/or  investigation,  Borrower hereby
grants  to  Administrative  Agent and its  agents,  employees,  consultants  and
contractors  the right to enter  into or onto the Land and any other  Facilities
currently owned, leased, operated or used by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
and to perform such tests on such property  (including  taking  samples of soil,
groundwater  and  suspected  asbestos-containing  materials)  as are  reasonably
necessary in connection therewith.  Any such investigation of any Facility shall
be conducted,  unless otherwise agreed to by Borrower and Administrative  Agent,
during normal business hours and, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall be
conducted so as not to interfere with the ongoing operations at such Facility or
to cause any  damage or loss to any  property  at such  Facility.  Borrower  and
Administrative  Agent  hereby  acknowledge  and  agree  that any  report  of any
investigation  conducted at the request of Administrative Agent pursuant to this
subsection 6.7A will be obtained and shall be used by  Administrative  Agent and
Lenders for the purposes of Lenders' internal credit  decisions,  to monitor and
police the Loans and to protect Lenders' security interests,  if any, created by
the Loan  Documents.  Administrative  Agent agrees to deliver a copy of any such
report to Borrower with the understanding  that Borrower  acknowledges and agree
that (x) it will  indemnify  and hold  harmless  Administrative  Agent  and each
Lender from any costs,  losses or  liabilities  relating to Borrower's use of or
reliance on such report, (y) neither  Administrative  Agent nor any Lender makes
any  representation  or  warranty  with  respect  to  such  report,  and  (z) by

                                       52

delivering such report to Borrower,  neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender
requiring  or   recommending   the   implementation   of  any   suggestions   or
recommendations contained in such report.

               B.   Environmental   Disclosure.   Borrower   will   deliver   to

               whether   prepared  by  personnel  of  Borrower  or  any  of  its
               Subsidiaries   or  Affiliates  or  by  independent   consultants,
               governmental  authorities or any other  Persons,  with respect to
               significant environmental matters at any Facility or with respect
               to any Environmental Claims;

               (ii) Notice of Certain Releases,  Remedial Actions, Etc. Promptly
               upon  the  occurrence  thereof,   written  notice  describing  in
               reasonable  detail (a) any Release required to be reported to any
               federal,  state or local  governmental or regulatory agency under
               any applicable  Environmental Laws, (b) any remedial action taken
               by Borrower or any other Person in response to (1) any  Hazardous
               Materials  Activities  the  existence  of which has a  reasonable
               possibility  of  resulting  in one or more  Environmental  Claims
               having,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  a Material  Adverse
               Effect, or (2) any Environmental Claims that,  individually or in
               the  aggregate,  have a reasonable  possibility of resulting in a
               Material Adverse Effect.

               (iii)  Written  Communications  Regarding  Environmental  Claims,
               Releases,  Etc. As soon as  practicable  following the sending or

               Affiliates,  a copy of any and all  written  communications  with
               respect to (a) any Environmental Claims that,  individually or in
               the aggregate,  have a reasonable possibility of giving rise to a
               Material Adverse Effect,  (b) any Release required to be reported
               to any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory agency,
               and (c) any request for information from any governmental  agency
               that suggests such agency is  investigating  whether  Borrower or
               any of its  Subsidiaries  may be potentially  responsible for any
               Hazardous Materials Activity.

               (iv)  Notice of Certain  Proposed  Actions  Having  Environmental
               Impact. Prompt written notice describing in reasonable detail (a)
               any  proposed  acquisition  of  stock,  assets,  or  property  by
               Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  that could  reasonably  be
               expected to (1) expose Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to, or
               result in, Environmental Claims that could reasonably be expected
               to have,  individually  or in the aggregate,  a Material  Adverse
               Effect  or (2)  affect  the  ability  of  Borrower  or any of its
               Subsidiaries  to maintain  in full force and effect all  material

               Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to modify current  operations
               in a manner that could reasonably be expected to subject Borrower
               or any of its Subsidiaries to any material additional obligations
               or  requirements   under  any   Environmental   Laws  that  could
               reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
               a Material Adverse Effect.

               (v) Other  Information.  With reasonable  promptness,  such other
               documents and  information as from time to time may be reasonably
               requested  by  Administrative  Agent in  relation  to any matters
               disclosed pursuant to this subsection 6.7.

               C. Borrower's Actions Regarding Hazardous  Materials  Activities,

               Borrower  shall promptly  undertake,  and shall cause each of its
               Subsidiaries  promptly to undertake,  any and all investigations,

               remediation  or  other  response  actions  necessary  to  remove,
               remediate, clean up or abate any Hazardous Materials Activity on,
               under  or  about  any  Facility  that  is  in  violation  of  any
               Environmental  Laws or that  presents a  material  risk of giving
               rise to an  Environmental  Claim. In the event Borrower or any of
               its  Subsidiaries  undertake  any such action with respect to any
               Hazardous  Materials,  Borrower or such Subsidiary  shall conduct
               and complete such action in  compliance in all material  respects
               with all applicable Environmental Laws and in accordance with the
               policies,  orders and directives of all federal,  state and local
               governmental  authorities  except  when,  and only to the  extent
               that,  Borrower's or such Subsidiary's  liability with respect to
               such  Hazardous  Materials  Activity is being  contested  in good
               faith by Borrower or such Subsidiary.

institute any action or proceeding  which the  Administrative  Agent  reasonably
determines   should  be   instituted  to  protect  the  interest  or  rights  of

Administrative  Agent  together  with  such  Loan  Documents  all  such  further
documents and  instruments  and take such further action  necessary to create in

Section 9.     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

9.1       Appointment.
---       ------------

               A.  Appointment  of  Administrative  Agent.  Scotiabank is hereby
appointed  Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and
each  Lender  hereby  authorizes  Administrative  Agent  to act as its  agent in
accordance  with the  terms of this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan  Documents.
Administrative Agent agrees to act upon the express conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan  Documents,  as applicable.  The provisions of this
Section 9 are  solely  for the  benefit  of  Administrative  Agent and  Lenders;
Borrower  shall  have no  rights  as a  third  party  beneficiary  of any of the
provisions thereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement,
Administrative Agent shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and does not assume
and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation  towards or  relationship
of agency or trust with or for Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

               B. Appointment of Supplemental  Agents. It is the purpose of this
Agreement and the other Loan  Documents  that there shall be no violation of any
law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations
or associations to transact  business as agent or trustee in such  jurisdiction.
It is recognized  that in case of litigation  under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the
Loan  Documents,  or in case  Administrative  Agent  deems that by reason of any
present or future law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights,
powers or remedies  granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take
any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, it
may be necessary that Administrative  Agent appoint an additional  individual or
institution as a separate  trustee,  co-trustee,  collateral agent or collateral
co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein
individually  as  a  "Supplemental  Agent"  and  collectively  as  "Supplemental
Agents").

               In the event that  Administrative  Agent  appoints a Supplemental
Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege
or duty  expressed  or  intended  by this  Agreement  or any of the  other  Loan
Documents to be exercised  by or vested in or conveyed to  Administrative  Agent
with  respect  to such  Collateral  shall  be  exercisable  by and  vest in such
Supplemental  Agent to the extent,  and only to the extent,  necessary to enable
such  Supplemental  Agent to exercise such rights,  powers and  privileges  with
respect to such  Collateral  and to perform  such  duties  with  respect to such
Collateral,  and every covenant and  obligation  contained in the Loan Documents

                                       63
<PAGE>

and necessary to the exercise or performance  thereof by such Supplemental Agent
shall  run to  and  be  enforceable  by  either  Administrative  Agent  or  such
Supplemental Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 9 and of subsections
10.2 and 10.3 that refer to  Administrative  Agent shall inure to the benefit of
such Supplemental Agent and all references therein to Administrative Agent shall
be deemed to be  references  to  Administrative  Agent and/or such  Supplemental
Agent, as the context may require.

               Should any  instrument in writing from Borrower or any other Loan
Party be  required by any  Supplemental  Agent so  appointed  for more fully and
certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges
and  duties,  Borrower  shall,  or shall  cause  such Loan  Party  to,  execute,
acknowledge  and deliver any and all such  instruments  promptly upon request by
the  Administrative  Agent.  In case  any  Supplemental  Agent,  or a  successor
thereto,  shall die, become incapable of acting,  resign or be removed,  all the
rights, powers,  privileges and duties of such Supplemental Agent, to the extent
permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by  Administrative  Agent until
the appointment of a new Supplemental Agent.

9.2       Powers and Duties; General Immunity.
---       ------------------------------------

               A. Powers; Duties Specified.  Each Lender irrevocably  authorizes
Administrative Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to exercise
such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as
are  specifically  delegated  or  granted to  Administrative  Agent by the terms
hereof and  thereof,  together  with such  powers,  rights and  remedies  as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent shall have only those duties
and  responsibilities  that are  expressly  specified in this  Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.  Administrative Agent may exercise such powers, rights and
remedies  and  perform  such  duties by or  through  its  agents  or  employees.
Administrative  Agent shall not have, by reason of this  Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents,  a fiduciary  relationship  in respect of any Lender;  and
nothing in this  Agreement  or any of the other  Loan  Documents,  expressed  or
implied,   is  intended  to  or  shall  be  so   construed  as  to  impose  upon
Administrative  Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan  Documents  except as expressly  set forth  herein or therein.

               B. No Responsibility  for Certain Matters.  Administrative  Agent
shall  not be  responsible  to any  Lender  for  the  execution,  effectiveness,
genuineness,  validity,  enforceability,  collectibility  or sufficiency of this
Agreement  or any other Loan  Document or for any  representations,  warranties,
recitals  or  statements  made  herein or therein or made in any written or oral
statements  or in any  financial or other  statements,  instruments,  reports or
certificates or any other documents furnished or made by Administrative Agent to
Lenders or by or on behalf of Borrower to Administrative  Agent or any Lender in
connection with the Loan Documents and the transactions  contemplated thereby or
for the financial condition or business affairs of Borrowers or any other Person
liable for the payment of any  Obligations,  nor shall  Administrative  Agent be
required to ascertain or inquire as to the  performance  or observance of any of
the terms, conditions,  provisions,  covenants or agreements contained in any of
the Loan  Documents  or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of
the Letters of Credit or as to the existence or possible  existence of any Event
of Default or Potential Event of Default.  Anything  contained in this Agreement
to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  Administrative  Agent  shall  not  have  any
liability  arising from  confirmations of the amount of outstanding Loans or the
Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts thereof.

               C. Exculpatory  Provisions.  Neither Administrative Agent nor any
of its officers,  directors,  employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders for
any action taken or omitted by Administrative  Agent under or in connection with
any of the Loan Documents except to the extent caused by Administrative  Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Administrative  Agent shall be entitled
to refrain  from any act or the taking of any action  (including  the failure to
take an  action)  in  connection  with this  Agreement  or any of the other Loan
Documents or from the exercise of any power,  discretion or authority  vested in
it  hereunder or  thereunder  unless and until  Administrative  Agent shall have
received  instructions in respect thereof from Requisite  Lenders (or such other
Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6) and,
upon receipt of such instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders,
as the case may be),  Administrative Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so
instructed)  refrain  from  acting,  or to exercise  such power,  discretion  or
authority,  in  accordance  with such  instructions.  Without  prejudice  to the
generality of the foregoing, (i) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
and shall be fully protected in relying,  upon any communication,  instrument or
document  believed  by it to be genuine  and  correct and to have been signed or
sent by the proper person or persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be
protected  in  relying  on  opinions  and  judgments  of  attorneys  (who may be
attorneys for Borrower and their Subsidiaries),  accountants,  experts and other
professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no Lender shall have any right of
action  whatsoever  against  Administrative  Agent as a result of Administrative
Agent  acting  or  (where so  instructed)  refraining  from  acting  under  this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions
of  Requisite  Lenders  (or such other  Lenders as may be  required to give such
instructions under subsection 10.6).

<PAGE>

               D.  Administrative  Agent  Entitled to Act as Lender.  The agency
hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of,
or impose any duties or obligations upon, Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity as a Lender  hereunder.  With respect to its participation in the Loans
and the Letters of Credit,  Administrative  Agent shall have the same rights and
powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not performing the duties and functions delegated to it hereunder,  and the term
"Lender" or  "Lenders"  or any similar  term shall,  unless the context  clearly
otherwise  indicates,  include  Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.
Administrative  Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to
and generally engage in any kind of banking,  trust, financial advisory or other
business with Borrower or any of its Affiliates as if it were not performing the
duties  specified  herein,  and may  accept  fees and other  consideration  from
Borrower for services in connection  with this  Agreement and otherwise  without
having to account for the same to Lenders.

9.3       Representations and Warranties; No Responsibility For Appraisal of
---       ------------------------------------------------------------------
          Credit Worthiness.
          ------------------

               Each  Lender  represents  and  warrants  that it has made its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Loans and the issuance of
the Letters of Credit  hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make
its own  appraisal of the  creditworthiness  of Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries.
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially
or on a continuing  basis, to make any such  investigation or any such appraisal
on  behalf  of  Lenders  or to  provide  any  Lender  with any  credit  or other
information with respect thereto,  whether coming into its possession before the
making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and Administrative Agent
shall  not  have any  responsibility  with  respect  to the  accuracy  of or the
completeness of any information provided to Lenders.

9.4       Right to Indemnity.
---       -------------------

               Each  Lender,  in  proportion  to its Pro Rata  Share,  severally
agrees to  indemnify  Administrative  Agent,  to the extent that  Administrative
Agent shall not have been  reimbursed  by Borrower,  for and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses  (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of
any kind or nature  whatsoever  which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against  Administrative  Agent in exercising its powers,  rights and remedies or
performing  its duties  hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise
in its capacity as Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
this  Agreement or the other Loan  Documents;  provided  that no Lender shall be
liable  for any  portion  of such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from  Administrative  Agent's  gross  negligence or willful  misconduct.  If any
indemnity  furnished  to  Administrative  Agent for any  purpose  shall,  in the
opinion  of   Administrative   Agent,  be   insufficient  or  become   impaired,
Administrative  Agent  may call  for  additional  indemnity  and  cease,  or not
commence,  to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished.

9.5       Successor Administrative Agent.
---       -------------------------------

               Administrative  Agent  may  resign at any time by giving 30 days'
prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Borrower,  and Administrative  Agent
may be removed at any time with or without  cause by an instrument or concurrent
instruments in writing delivered to Borrower and Administrative Agent and signed
by Requisite  Lenders.  Upon any such notice of resignation or any such removal,
Requisite  Lenders  shall have the right,  upon five  Business  Days'  notice to
Borrower,  to  appoint a  successor  Administrative  Agent  (provided  that such
successor is or simultaneously  therewith becomes a Lender). Upon the acceptance
of  any   appointment  as   Administrative   Agent   hereunder  by  a  successor
Administrative  Agent,  that  successor  Administrative  Agent  shall  thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,  privileges and duties
of the  retiring  or removed  Administrative  Agent and the  retiring or removed
Administrative  Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations  under
this Agreement. After any retiring or removed Administrative Agent's resignation
or removal hereunder as  Administrative  Agent, the provisions of this Section 9
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

9.6       Collateral Documents and Subsidiary Guaranties.
---       -----------------------------------------------

               Each Lender hereby further  authorizes  Administrative  Agent, on
behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into each Collateral Document
and Subsidiary  Guaranty as secured party or beneficiary  (as  applicable),  and
each  Lender  agrees to be bound by the terms of each  Collateral  Document  and
Subsidiary Guaranty; provided that Administrative Agent shall not (i) enter into
or consent to any material amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any

                                       65

provision contained in any Collateral Document or Subsidiary  Guaranty,  or (ii)
release any  Collateral  (except as  otherwise  expressly  permitted or required
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the applicable  Collateral Document),
in each case  without the prior  consent of  Requisite  Lenders (or, if required
pursuant to subsection  10.6, all Lenders);  provided  further,  however,  that,
without further written consent or  authorization  from Lenders,  Administrative
Agent may execute any  documents  or  instruments  necessary  to (i) release any
Subsidiary  from  the  Subsidiary  Guaranty  to the  extent  the  stock  of such
Subsidiary is sold in a transaction  permitted under this Agreement or otherwise
consented to by Requisite  Lenders in accordance  with  subsection  10.6 or (ii)
release any Lien  encumbering  any item of  Collateral  that is the subject of a
sale or other  disposition  of assets  permitted  by this  Agreement or to which
Requisite  Lenders have otherwise  consented in accordance with subsection 10.6.
And  anything   contained  in  any  of  the  Loan   Documents  to  the  contrary
notwithstanding,  Borrower,  Administrative  Agent and each Lender  hereby agree
that (X) no Lender shall have any right  individually to realize upon any of the
Collateral  under any Collateral  Document,  it being understood and agreed that
all  powers,  rights  and  remedies  under  the  Collateral  Documents  and each
Subsidiary  Guaranty may be  exercised  solely by  Administrative  Agent for the
benefit of Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y) in the event of
a foreclosure by  Administrative  Agent on any of the  Collateral  pursuant to a
public or private sale,  Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser
of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and  Administrative  Agent, as
agent for and representative of Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or
their respective  individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise
agree in  writing)  shall be  entitled,  for the  purpose of bidding  and making
settlement  or  payment  of the  purchase  price for all or any  portion  of the
Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations
as a credit on  account  of the  purchase  price for any  collateral  payable by
Administrative Agent at such sale.

10.1      Assignments and Participations in Loans.
----      ----------------------------------------

               A. General.  Subject to subsection  10.1B, each Lender shall have
the right at any time to (i) sell, assign or transfer to any Eligible  Assignee,
or (ii) sell  participations  to any Eligible  Assignee or any other Person with
the approval of Borrower in, all or any part of its  Commitments  or any Loan or
Loans made by it or its Letters of Credit or participations therein or any other
interest  herein or in any other  Obligations  owed to it; provided that no such
sale,  assignment,  transfer  or  participation  shall,  without  the consent of
Borrower,  require Borrower to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify such sale,  assignment,  transfer or
participation under the securities laws of any state; provided,  further that no
such  sale,  assignment  or  transfer  described  in clause  (i) above  shall be
effective  unless  and  until  an  Assignment  Agreement  effecting  such  sale,
assignment  or transfer  shall have been  accepted by  Administrative  Agent and
recorded  in the  Register as provided in  subsection  10.1B(ii)  and  provided,
further that no such sale,  assignment,  transfer or participation of any Letter
of Credit  or any  participation  therein  may be made  separately  from a sale,
assignment,  transfer  or  participation  of a  corresponding  interest  in  the
Commitment and the Loans of the Lender effecting such sale, assignment, transfer
or  participation.  Except as otherwise  provided in this  subsection  10.1,  no
Lender  shall,  as between  Borrower and such Lender,  be relieved of any of its
obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any
granting of participations  in, all or any part of its Commitments or the Loans,
the Letters of Credit or participations  therein,  or the other Obligations owed
to such Lender.

               B. Assignments.

               (i)  Amounts and Terms of  Assignments.  Each  Commitment,  Loan,
               Letter of Credit or  participation  therein,  or other Obligation
               may in whole or in part (a) be assigned, in any amount to another
               Lender,  or to an  Affiliate of the  assigning  Lender or another
               Lender,  or may be pledged to an Eligible  Assignee in support of
               its obligations to such assignee (without  releasing the pledging
               Lender from any of its obligations hereunder), with the giving of
               notice to Borrower and  Administrative  Agent;  provided  that if
               such  assignment  relates to Revolving  Loans or  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments,  the  assignee  shall  represent  that  it  has  the
               financial resources to fulfill its commitments hereunder and such
               assignment  is consented to by  Administrative  Agent and Issuing
               Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed)
               or (b) be  assigned  in an  aggregate  amount  of not  less  than
               $1,000,000  (or  such  lesser  amount  as  shall  constitute  the
               aggregate amount of the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit and
               participations  therein,  and other  Obligations of the assigning
               Lender)  to any  other  Eligible  Assignee  with the  consent  of
               Borrower and  Administrative  Agent (which  consent  shall not be
               unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed);   provided  that  any  such
               assignment  in  accordance  with  either  clause (a) or (b) above
               shall  effect  a pro rata  assignment  (based  on the  respective
               principal  amounts thereof then outstanding or in effect) of both

                                       66
<PAGE>

               the Term  Loan  Commitment  and the Term  Loans of the  assigning
               Lender,  on the one hand, and the Revolving  Loan  Commitment and
               the Revolving Loans of the assigning  Lender,  on the other hand,
               except  where  such  Lender  does not hold  both  Revolving  Loan
               Commitments or Revolving Loans and Term Loan  Commitments or Term
               Loans and  provided  further that if such  assignment  relates to
               Revolving Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, the assignee shall
               represent  that it has the  financial  resources  to fulfill  its
               commitments  hereunder  and such  assignment  is  consented to by
               Administrative  Agent and Issuing  Lender  (which  consent  maybe
               given or withheld in their sole discretion). To the extent of any
               such  assignment  in  accordance  with  either  clause (a) or (b)
               above,  the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations
               with  respect  to its  Commitments,  Loans,  Letters of Credit or
               participations  therein,  or  other  Obligations  or the  portion
               thereof  so  assigned.  The  assignor  or  assignee  to each such
               assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent, for
               its  acceptance  and  recording in the  Register,  an  Assignment
               Agreement,  together  with a processing  and  recordation  fee of
               $3,500 in respect of assignments, and such forms, certificates or
               other  evidence,  if any, with respect to United  States  federal
               income  tax  withholding  matters  as  the  assignee  under  such
               Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative
               Agent pursuant to subsection  2.7B(iii)(a).  Upon such execution,
               delivery,   acceptance  and  recordation,   from  and  after  the
               effective date specified in such  Assignment  Agreement,  (y) the
               assignee  thereunder  shall be a party  hereto and, to the extent
               that rights and  obligations  hereunder  have been assigned to it
               pursuant to such Assignment Agreement,  shall have the rights and
               obligations  of a Lender  hereunder and (z) the assigning  Lender
               thereunder  shall,  to the extent  that  rights  and  obligations
               hereunder  have been  assigned by it pursuant to such  Assignment
               Agreement,  relinquish  its rights  (other than any rights  which
               survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection 10.9B)
               and be released from its  obligations  under this Agreement (and,
               in  the  case  of an  Assignment  Agreement  covering  all or the
               remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations
               under  this  Agreement,  such  Lender  shall  cease to be a party
               hereto;  provided  that,  anything  contained  in any of the Loan
               Documents to the contrary notwithstanding,  if such Lender is the
               Issuing Lender with respect to any outstanding  Letters of Credit
               such Lender shall continue to have all rights and  obligations of
               an Issuing  Lender with  respect to such  Letters of Credit until
               the  cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and the
               reimbursement of any amounts drawn  thereunder).  The Commitments
               hereunder  shall be modified to reflect  the  Commitment  of such
               assignee and any remaining  Commitment of such  assigning  Lender
               and, if any such  assignment  occurs  after the issuance of Notes
               hereunder,  the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of
               such  assignment  or  as  promptly   thereafter  as  practicable,
               surrender  its  applicable  Notes  to  Administrative  Agent  for
               cancellation,  and  thereupon  new  Notes  shall be issued to the
               assignee and to the assigning  Lender,  substantially in the form
               of Exhibits III-A and III-B annexed hereto,  as applicable,  with
               appropriate  insertions,  to reflect the new  Commitments  and/or
               outstanding  Loans,  as the case may be, of the  assignee and the
               assigning Lender.

               (ii) Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in Register.
               Upon  its  receipt  of an  Assignment  Agreement  executed  by an
               assigning  Lender  and an  assignee  representing  that  it is an
               Eligible  Assignee,  together with the processing and recordation
               fee   referred  to  in   subsection   10.1B(i)   and  any  forms,
               certificates  or other  evidence  with  respect to United  States
               federal income tax withholding  matters that such assignee may be
               required  to  deliver  to   Administrative   Agent   pursuant  to
               subsection   2.7B(iii)(a),   Administrative   Agent   shall,   if
               Administrative  Agent has consented to the  assignment  evidenced
               thereby  (to the extent  such  consent is  required  pursuant  to
               subsection  10.1B(i)),  (a) accept such  Assignment  Agreement by
               executing  a  counterpart  thereof  as  provided  therein  (which
               acceptance shall evidence any required consent of  Administrative
               Agent to such assignment),  (b) record the information  contained
               therein in the Register,  and (c) give prompt  notice  thereof to
               Borrower.  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  a copy of each
               Assignment  Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as provided
               in this subsection 10.1B(ii).

               C. Participations. The holder of any participation, other than an
Affiliate of the Lender  granting such  participation,  shall not be entitled to
require such Lender to take or omit to take any action  hereunder  except action
directly affecting (i) the extension of the scheduled final maturity date of any
Loan allocated to such  participation,  (ii) a reduction of the principal amount
of or the rate of interest payable on any Loan allocated to such  participation,
or (iii) releasing all or substantially  all of the Collateral,  and all amounts
payable by Borrower hereunder (including amounts payable to such Lender pursuant

                                       67
<PAGE>

to subsections  2.6D and 2.7) shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold
such participation.  Borrower and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that,
solely for purposes of  subsections  10.4 and 10.5, (a) any  participation  will
give rise to a direct  obligation  of  Borrower to the  participant  and (b) the
participant shall be considered to be a "Lender".

               D.  Assignments  to Federal  Reserve  Banks.  In  addition to the
assignments and participations  permitted under the foregoing provisions of this
subsection  10.1,  any Lender  may  assign and pledge all or any  portion of its
Loans, the other  Obligations owed to such Lender,  and its Notes to any Federal
Reserve Bank as  collateral  security  pursuant to  Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal  Reserve  System and any operating  circular  issued by
such  Federal  Reserve  Bank;  provided  that (i) no Lender  shall,  as  between
Borrower and such Lender,  be relieved of any of its obligations  hereunder as a
result of any such assignment and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such Federal
Reserve  Bank be  considered  to be a "Lender"  or be  entitled  to require  the
assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

               E.   Information.   Each  Lender  may  furnish  any   information
concerning  Borrowers and their  Subsidiaries  in the  possession of that Lender
from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees
and participants),  subject to subsection 10.19.

               F.  Representations  of  Lenders.   Each  Lender  listed  on  the
signature  pages hereof  hereby  represents  and warrants that it is an Eligible
Assignee  described in clause (A) of the  definition  thereof.  Each Lender that
becomes a party hereto  pursuant to an Assignment  Agreement  shall be deemed to
agree that the  representations  and  warranties  of such  Lender  contained  in
Section  2(c) of such  Assignment  Agreement  are  incorporated  herein  by this
reference.

10.3      Indemnity.
----      ----------

               In addition to the  payment of  expenses  pursuant to  subsection
10.2, whether or not the transactions  contemplated hereby shall be consummated,

consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), indemnify,
pay and hold  harmless  Administrative  Agent,  and  Lenders  and the  officers,
directors, employees, agents and affiliates of Administrative Agent, and Lenders
(collectively   called  the  "Indemnitees"),   from  and  against  any  and  all

                                       68
<PAGE>

Indemnified  Liabilities (as hereinafter defined);  provided that Borrower shall
not  have  any  obligation  to any  Indemnitee  hereunder  with  respect  to any
Indemnified  Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise solely
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined
by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

               As used herein,  "Indemnified  Liabilities" means,  collectively,
any  and  all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages  (including  natural
resource  damages),  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  claims (including
Environmental Claims),  costs (including the costs of any investigation,  study,

(including the reasonable fees and  disbursements  of counsel for Indemnitees in
connection  with  any  investigative,   administrative  or  judicial  proceeding
commenced or threatened by any Person,  whether or not any such Indemnitee shall

incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity),  whether direct,  indirect
or  consequential  and  whether  based on any  federal,  state or foreign  laws,
statutes,  rules or  regulations  (including  securities  and  commercial  laws,
statutes,  rules or  regulations  and  Environmental  Laws),  on  common  law or
equitable  cause or on contract or otherwise,  that may be imposed on,  incurred

arising out of (i) this  Agreement  or the other Loan  Documents  or the Project
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including Lenders'
agreement to make the Loans hereunder or the use or intended use of the proceeds
thereof or the use or intended use of any thereof,  or any enforcement of any of
the Loan Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other realization
upon  any of the  Collateral  or the  enforcement  of any  Guaranty),  (ii)  the
statements  contained in any commitment letter or term sheet delivered by Lender

Hazardous   Materials  Activity  relating  to  or  arising  from,   directly  or
indirectly, any past or present activity, operation, land ownership, or practice
of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

               To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and
hold harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in whole or
in part because they are violative of any law or public  policy,  Borrower shall
contribute  the maximum  portion that it is  permitted to pay and satisfy  under
applicable law to the payment and  satisfaction of all  Indemnified  Liabilities
incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

----      -----------------------------------------------

               In  addition  to  any  rights  now  or  hereafter  granted  under
applicable  law  and not by way of  limitation  of any  such  rights,  upon  the
occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby  authorized by Borrower
at any time or from time to time,  without  notice to  Borrower  or to any other
Person,  any  such  notice  being  hereby  expressly  waived,  to set off and to
appropriate  and to apply any and all  deposits  (general or special,  including
Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured,
but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or
owing by that Lender to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against and
on account of the  obligations  and liabilities of Borrower to that Lender under
this Agreement,  the Letters of Credit and participations  therein and the other
Loan Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising out of
or  connected  with this  Agreement,  the  Letters of Credit and  participations
therein  or any other  Loan  Document,  irrespective  of whether or not (i) that
Lender  shall have made any demand  hereunder  or (ii) the  principal  of or the
interest  on the Loans or any amounts in respect of the Letters of Credit or any
other  amounts  due  hereunder  shall have  become due and  payable  pursuant to
Section 8 and although said obligations and liabilities,  or any of them, may be
contingent or unmatured.  Borrower hereby further grants to Administrative Agent
and each Lender a security interest in all deposits and accounts maintained with
Administrative Agent or such Lender as security for the Obligations.

10.5      Ratable Sharing.
----      ----------------

               Lenders hereby agree among  themselves that if any of them shall,
whether by voluntary  payment  (other than a voluntary  prepayment of Loans made
and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon
security,  through the  exercise of any right of set-off or  banker's  lien,  by
counterclaim  or cross action or by the  enforcement of any right under the Loan
Documents or otherwise,  or as adequate  protection of a deposit treated as cash
collateral  under  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  receive  payment  or  reduction  of a
proportion of the aggregate  amount of principal,  interest,  amounts payable in
respect of Letters of Credit,  fees and other amounts then due and owing to that
Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate
Amounts Due" to such Lender)  which is greater than the  proportion  received by
any other Lender in respect of the  Aggregate  Amounts Due to such other Lender,

Administrative  Agent and each other  Lender of the receipt of such  payment and
(ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase  participations (which it shall
be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a  participation  simultaneously

                                       69

Amounts  Due to the  other  Lenders  so that all such  recoveries  of  Aggregate
Amounts  Due shall be shared  by all  Lenders  in  proportion  to the  Aggregate
Amounts  Due to  them;  provided  that if all or  part  of such  proportionately
greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter  recovered from
such Lender upon the  bankruptcy  or  reorganization  of Borrowers or otherwise,
those  purchases  shall  be  rescinded  and the  purchase  prices  paid for such
participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent
of such  recovery,  but  without  interest.  Borrower  expressly  consent to the
foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased
may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien,  set-off or counterclaim  with
respect to any and all monies  owing by Borrower  to that  holder  with  respect
thereto as fully as if that  holder  were owed the  amount of the  participation
held by that holder.

amendment,  modification,  termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance
with  this  subsection  10.6  shall be  binding  upon  each  Lender  at the time

Loans,  accrued interest thereon, and accrued fees and all other Obligations and
other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee or the Borrower and (ii)

if a particular  action or condition is not permitted by any of such  covenants,
the fact that it would be permitted by an  exception  to, or would  otherwise be
within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an
Event of  Default  or  Potential  Event of  Default  if such  action is taken or
condition exists.

10.8      Notices.

               Unless  otherwise  specifically  provided  herein,  any notice or

subsection 10.19 shall survive the payment of the Loans and the reimbursement of
any amounts drawn thereunder, and the termination of this Agreement.

10.10     Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
-----     ------------------------------------------------------

               No  failure or delay on the part of  Administrative  Agent or any
Lender in the exercise of any power,  right or privilege  hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall impair such power,  right or privilege or be construed
to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence  therein,  nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise  thereof  or of any other  power,  right or  privilege.  All rights and
remedies  existing  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan  Documents  are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

Borrower makes a payment or payments to  Administrative  Agent or Lenders (or to
Administrative  Agent for the  benefit of Lenders)  or  Administrative  Agent or
Lenders or enforce any security  interests  or exercise  their rights of setoff,
and such  payment or payments or the proceeds of such  enforcement  or setoff or
any part thereof are  subsequently  invalidated,  declared to be  fraudulent  or
preferential,  set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee,  receiver or
any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common
law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation
or part thereof originally  intended to be satisfied,  and all Liens, rights and
remedies  therefor or related  thereto,  shall be revived and  continued in full
force  and  effect  as if such  payment  or  payments  had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

                                       71

obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

10.13     Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders' Rights.

               The  obligations  of Lenders  hereunder are several and no Lender
shall be  responsible  for the  obligations  or  Commitments of any other Lender
hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action
taken by  Lenders  pursuant  hereto or  thereto,  shall be deemed to  constitute
Lenders as a partnership,  an association,  a joint venture or any other kind of
entity.

10.14     Headings.

Lenders'  rights  of  assignment  are  subject  to  subsection  10.1).   Neither
