circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default

Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in

participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent,

Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this subsection will not relieve the Borrower of
any default in the payment thereof.</font></p>
