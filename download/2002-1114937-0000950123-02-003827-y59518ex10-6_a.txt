       PROVIDED THAT the amount of the Revolving Facility available for the
       purposes specified in sub-clauses 2.2.2 to 2.2.6 shall be limited to the
       Available Working Capital Amount.

2.3    PURPOSE AFTER PUSHDOWN
       On and after the Pushdown Date:

       2.3.1   the Revolving Facility is intended to be used by the Borrowers:

               (a)  to finance the working capital requirements of the UK Group;

               (b)  to finance, or refinance, Permitted Acquisitions (other than
                    the Acquisition); and

               (c)  to finance Asset Adjustment Payments; and

       2.3.2   the Term Facility is intended to be used by the Post-Novation
               Borrower to refinance amounts outstanding under the Revolving
               Facility.

2.4    APPLICATION
       Each Borrower shall apply all amounts raised by it hereunder in or
       towards satisfaction of, prior to the Pushdown, the purposes specified in
       Clause 2.2 (Purpose prior to Pushdown) and, on and after the Pushdown,
       the purposes specified in Clause 2.3 (Purpose after Pushdown) and none of
       the Finance Parties shall be obliged to concern themselves with such
       application.

2.5    INITIAL CONDITIONS PRECEDENT
       2.5.1   The conditions precedent to availability of the Revolving
               Facility (being the documents and other evidence listed in Part A
               (Initial Revolving Bank Conditions Precedent) of Schedule 3
               (Conditions Precedent)) have been satisfied.

       2.5.2   Save as the Term Banks may otherwise agree, none of the Term
               Banks shall have any obligation to make the Term Loan available
               until the Term Effective Date has occurred.

2.6    BANKS' OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL
       The obligations of each Bank are several and the failure by a Bank to
       perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the obligations of an
       Obligor towards any other


                                       77
<PAGE>


       party hereto nor shall any other party be liable for the failure by such
       Bank to perform its obligations hereunder.

2.7    BANKS' RIGHTS SEVERAL
       The rights of each Bank are several and any debt arising hereunder at any
       time from an Obligor to any of the other parties hereto shall be a
       separate and independent debt. Each such party shall, save as otherwise
       provided in the this Agreement, the Security Trust Agreement and the
       Second Security Trust Agreement, be entitled to protect and enforce its
       individual rights arising out of this Agreement independently of any
       other party (so that it shall not be necessary for any party hereto to be
       joined as an additional party in any proceedings for this purpose).

2.8    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SECOND SECURITY
       The Revolving Banks acknowledge that, notwithstanding that the Security
       covers the Term Loan and the Term Banks, the Term Banks will also be
       taking the security constituted or to be constituted by, or pursuant to,
       the Second Security Documents. Each party hereto undertakes that it will
       not at any time bring any legal action to challenge the validity or
       effectiveness of any of the security purported to be created under or
       pursuant to any Security Document or Second Security Document. Further,
       and for the avoidance of doubt, the Term Banks acknowledge (for the
       purposes of Section 94 of the Law of Property Act, 1925) that,
       notwithstanding the Second Security, all Advances made by the Banks from
       time to time are intended to have the benefit of the Security which ranks
       in priority to the Second Security given in respect of the Term Advances.


3.     UTILISATION OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

3.1    DRAWDOWN CONDITIONS FOR REVOLVING ADVANCES
       A Revolving Advance will be made by the Revolving Banks to a Borrower if:

       3.1.1   during the Notice Period, the Agent has received a completed
               Notice of Drawdown from such Borrower;

       3.1.2   the proposed date for the making of such Revolving Advance is a
               Business Day falling one month or more before the Revolving
               Termination Date;

       3.1.3   the proposed amount of such Revolving Advance is (a) if less than
               the Available Revolving Facility an amount or integral multiple
               of Pound Sterling50,000,000 (or such lesser amount as the
               Pre-Novation Borrower and the Agent may agree in respect of a
               Revolving Advance to be utilised to refinance Existing Target
               Indebtedness) or (b) equal to the amount of the Available
               Revolving Facility;

       3.1.4   in respect of any Revolving Advance which:

               (a)  is requested prior to the Pushdown Date; and

               (b)  is to be used to finance any of the purposes set out in
                    sub-clauses 2.2.2 to 2.2.6 of Clause 2.2 (Purpose prior to
                    Pushdown),

               the amount of such a Revolving Advance is equal to or less than
               the Available Working Capital Amount;



                                       78
<PAGE>

       3.1.5   there would not, immediately after the making of such a Revolving
               Advance, be more than ten Revolving Advances outstanding;

       3.1.6   save for Revolving Advances requested to be made during the
               Certain Funds Period and Rollover Advances, neither of the events
               mentioned in sub-clauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 of Clause 9.1 (Market
               Disruption) shall have occurred;

       3.1.7   in respect of any Revolving Advance requested by a Borrower prior
               to the Pushdown Date, the proposed Term of the Revolving Advance
               requested is a period of one, two, three or six months or such
               other period as the Agent (acting on the instructions of all of
               the Revolving Banks) may agree in each case ending on or before
               the estimated Pushdown Date (as from time to time agreed between
               the Agent and the Relevant Obligor) PROVIDED THAT prior to the
               Syndication Date, only periods of one month (or, if less, such
               duration necessary to ensure that such Term shall end on the
               Syndication Date) or such other period as the Pre-Novation
               Borrower and the Agent may agree may be requested;

       3.1.8   in respect of any Revolving Advance requested by a Borrower after
               the Pushdown Date and:

               (a)  prior to any Additional Finance Provider Accession Date, the
                    proposed Term of the Revolving Advance requested shall be a
                    period of one, two, three or six months or such other period
                    as the Agent (acting on the instructions of all Revolving
                    Banks) may agree in each case ending on or before such
                    Additional Finance Provider Accession Date; and

               (b)  after the final Additional Finance Provider Accession Date,
                    the proposed Term of the Revolving Advance requested shall
                    be a period of one, two, three or six months or such other
                    period as the Agent (acting on the instructions of all
                    Revolving Banks) may agree in each case ending on or before
                    the Revolving Termination Date; and

       3.1.9   on and as of the proposed date for the making of such Revolving
               Advance:

               (a)  in the case of any Revolving Advance requested to be made
                    during the Certain Funds Period, no Certain Funds Event of
                    Default is continuing;

               (b)  in the case of Revolving Advances not within paragraph (a)
                    above (other than Rollover Advances), (i) no Event of
                    Default or Potential Event of Default is continuing and (ii)
                    the Repeated Representations are true in all material
                    respects; or

               (c)  in the case of Rollover Advances not within paragraph (a)
                    above, (i) no Event of Default is continuing and (ii) those
                    of the Repeated Representations which are not capable of
                    remedy or change if incorrect or misleading in any material
                    respect, are true in all material respects.

3.2    TERMS ENDING ON REVOLVING REDUCTION DATES
       The Borrowers shall ensure that there are sufficient Revolving Advances
       with Terms ending on or before the next succeeding Revolving Reduction
       Date to allow the


                                       79
<PAGE>


       reduction in the Revolving Commitments scheduled to take place on that
       Revolving Reduction Date to occur. If the Borrowers have not so ensured
       the Agent may, subject to Clause 28.4 (Break Costs), shorten the Terms of
       one or more Revolving Advances agreed with the Relevant Obligor to so
       ensure.

3.3    EACH REVOLVING BANK'S PARTICIPATION IN REVOLVING ADVANCES Each Revolving
       Bank will participate through its Facility Office in each Revolving
       Advance made pursuant to this Clause 3 in the proportion borne by its
       Available Revolving Commitment to the Available Revolving Facility
       immediately prior to the making of that Revolving Advance.

3.4    REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE REVOLVING COMMITMENT
       If a Revolving Bank's Revolving Commitment is reduced in accordance with
       the terms hereof after the Agent has received the Notice of Drawdown for
       a Revolving Advance and such reduction was not taken into account in the
       Available Revolving Facility, then the amount of that Revolving Advance
       shall be reduced accordingly.


4.     PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON REVOLVING ADVANCES

4.1    PAYMENT OF INTEREST
       On the Repayment Date relating to each Revolving Advance (and, if the
       Term of such Revolving Advance exceeds six months, on the expiry of each
       period of six months during such Term) the Borrower to which such
       Revolving Advance has been made shall pay accrued interest on that
       Revolving Advance.

4.2    CALCULATION OF INTEREST
       The rate of interest applicable to a Revolving Advance from time to time
       during its Term shall be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

       4.2.1   the Revolving Margin at such time;

       4.2.2   the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

       4.2.3   LIBOR.

4.3    REVOLVING MARGIN RATCHET
       The Revolving Margin shall:

       4.3.1   from the date hereof until the Pushdown Date, be 2.25 per cent.
               per annum;

       4.3.2   (if relevant) on and after the Pushdown Date and until the date
               falling 12 months after the date hereof, be 2.00 per cent. per
               annum; and

       4.3.3   at any other time, subject to Clause 4.5 (Revolving Default
               Margin) and in accordance with the provisions of Clause 4.4
               (Revolving Margin Changes), be the percentage rate per annum
               determined by the ratio of EBITDA of the UK Group in respect of
               the Relevant Period ended on the most recent Quarter Date to the
               Total Net Cash Finance Charges for that Relevant Period in
               accordance with the table set out below.

4.4    REVOLVING MARGIN CHANGES
       Any reduction or increase to the Revolving Margin provided for by Clause
       4.3 (Revolving Margin Ratchet) shall take effect in relation to all
       existing Revolving Advances and future Revolving Advances, in each case
       with effect from the date the Agent receives the Parent's Compliance
       Certificate in accordance with Clause 21.4 (Compliance Certificates) for
       its most recent Financial Quarter. Any change in the Revolving Margin
       applicable to an existing Revolving Advance shall only relate to the
       remainder of the current Term of such a Revolving Advance.

4.5    REVOLVING DEFAULT MARGIN
       The Revolving Margin shall be 2.25 per cent. per annum from the date
       determined by the Agent (acting reasonably) (in writing) as being the
       date on which an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has
       occurred or come into existence until the date specified by the Agent (in
       writing) as being the date on which it has been demonstrated to its
       satisfaction (acting reasonably) that such Event of Default or Potential
       Event of Default is no longer continuing. The Agent shall promptly notify
       the other parties hereto of any determination that an Event of Default or
       Potential Event of Default has occurred or exists or, as the case may be,
       that it has been demonstrated to its reasonable satisfaction that such is
       no longer continuing.


5.     INCREMENTAL FACILITY

5.1    REQUEST FOR INCREMENTAL FACILITY
       If no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred and is
       continuing, the Parent may, at any time after the date falling 12 months
       after the Acquisition Date, deliver to the Agent and the Arrangers a
       request (the "INCREMENTAL FACILITY REQUEST") requesting that the
       Arrangers arrange the Incremental Facility.

5.2    REQUIREMENTS OF INCREMENTAL FACILITY REQUEST
       The Incremental Facility Request shall be in writing and shall specify:

       5.2.1   the proposed amount of the Incremental Facility, which shall not
               exceed Pound Sterling300,000,000 in principal aggregate amount;

       5.2.2   the proposed final maturity date of the Incremental Facility,
               which shall be no earlier than 31 March 2006;



                                       81
<PAGE>




       5.2.3   the proposed margin payable on amounts drawn under the
               Incremental Facility; and

       5.2.4   the other proposed key terms and conditions of the Incremental
               Facility, which (subject to its being priced by reference to
               market conditions on and around the date of delivery of the
               Incremental Facility Request) shall be no more onerous than the
               terms of this Agreement.

5.3    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY BANKS
       The Banks consent to the incurrence by the Borrowers of the additional
       indebtedness under the Incremental Facility, which shall rank pari passu
       with indebtedness under the Revolving Facility and the Term Facility.
       Subject to an intercreditor agreement acceptable to all of the Banks
       being entered into between the Banks and the lenders under the
       Incremental Facility, the indebtedness under the Incremental Facility may
       be secured on assets subject to the Security Documents and/or the Second
       Security Documents. The Banks (and/or their designated representatives)
       shall negotiate in good faith with the proposed lenders under the
       Incremental Facility, with a view to such an intercreditor agreement
       being agreed and executed as soon as reasonably practicable. The Banks
       shall have the opportunity, but shall not be obliged, to participate in
       the Incremental Facility and hereby consent to the Incremental Facility
       being offered to persons who are not Banks at the time the Incremental
       Facility Request is delivered by the Parent. The Incremental Facility
       shall be priced by reference to market conditions on and around the date
       of delivery of the Incremental Facility Request, but shall otherwise
       contain terms no more onerous than the terms hereof, as the same shall be
       agreed between the parties hereto and any additional persons who agree to
       participate in the Incremental Facility.

5.4    INCREASE OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY
       5.4.1   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 5, the Banks
               agree that the amount of the Revolving Facility may be increased
               from time to time up to a maximum of Pound Sterling2,720,000,000
               in principal aggregate amount PROVIDED THAT:

               (a)  the increase in the Revolving Facility (the "ADDITIONAL
                    AMOUNT") shall not exceed Pound Sterling220,000,000 in
                    principal aggregate amount or, if the unutilised portion of
                    the Incremental Facility is less than Pound
                    Sterling220,000,000 at any time, the amount of the
                    unutilised portion of the Incremental Facility;

               (b)  the Additional Amount is made available by the Additional
                    Finance Providers only and, prior to the relevant increase
                    in the Revolving Facility, the relevant Additional Finance
                    Provider has acceded to this Agreement in accordance with
                    the provisions of Clause 5.5 (Accession of the Additional
                    Finance Providers); and

               (c)  the Parent has notified the Agent of the date of the
                    proposed accession to this Agreement of the relevant
                    Additional Finance Provider and the amount of such
                    Additional Finance Provider's Revolving Commitment to be
                    specified in the relevant Additional Finance Provider
                    Accession Undertaking at least 5 Business Days prior to the
                    relevant Additional Finance Provider Accession Date.

       5.4.2   A Revolving Bank which is an Additional Finance Provider may, in
               its sole discretion, increase the amount of its Revolving
               Commitment by giving the Agent not less than 10 Business Days
               prior written notice to that effect, specifying the proposed
               amount of the increase in its Revolving Commitment and the date
               on which such increase is to take effect, if:

               (a)  the amount of that increase is a minimum amount of Pound
                    Sterling20,000,000 and a whole multiple of Pound
                    Sterling5,000,000;

               (b)  the amount of that increase will not, when aggregated with
                    the Revolving Commitments of the Additional Finance
                    Providers at such time, cause the Additional Amount to
                    exceed Pound Sterling220,000,000 or, if the unutilised
                    portion of the Incremental Facility is less than Pound
                    Sterling220,000,000 at that time, the amount of the
                    unutilised portion of the Incremental Facility;

               (c)  on the date on which that increase is expressed to take
                    effect, no Revolving Advance will be outstanding (excluding,
                    for the avoidance of doubt, any Revolving Advance with a
                    Term which ends or begins on that date); and

               (d)  that Additional Finance Provider has not previously given a
                    notice under this sub-clause,

               and such increase shall take effect as so requested.

5.5    ACCESSION OF ADDITIONAL FINANCE PROVIDERS
       5.5.1   The accession of each Additional Finance Provider shall be
               effected by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed
               Additional Finance Provider Accession Undertaking. Each of the
               Obligors and NTL CC hereby authorises the Relevant Obligor to
               sign on its behalf, and each Finance Party (other than the Agent)
               hereby authorises the Agent to sign on its behalf, each
               Additional Finance Provider Accession Undertaking.

       5.5.2   No Additional Finance Provider may deliver an Additional Finance
               Provider Accession Undertaking if a Revolving Advance will be
               outstanding on the relevant proposed Additional Finance Provider
               Accession Date (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
               Revolving Advance with a Term which ends or begins on the
               Additional Finance Provider Accession Date).

       5.5.3   With effect from each Additional Finance Provider Accession Date:

               (a)  the Parent, NTL CC and each of the Obligors and the relevant
                    Additional Finance Provider shall assume obligations towards
                    one another and/or acquire rights against one another; and

               (b)  the Agent, the Arrangers, the Banks and such Additional
                    Finance Provider shall acquire the same rights and benefits
                    and assume the same obligations between themselves,



                                       83
<PAGE>

               as they would have acquired and assumed had such Additional
               Finance Provider been an original party hereto as a Revolving
               Bank.

       5.5.4   If all the conditions of this Clause 5.5 (Accession of Additional
               Finance Providers) are satisfied, the relevant Additional Finance
               Provider will become a Revolving Bank on the relevant Additional
               Finance Provider Accession Date with a Revolving Commitment as
               notified to the Agent in its Additional Finance Provider
               Accession Undertaking and the Agent shall promptly notify the
               Relevant Obligor, the relevant Additional Finance Provider and
               each Bank of the same.

5.6    REDUCTION OF INCREMENTAL FACILITY
       The reference to Pound Sterling300,000,000 (as such amount may have been
       reduced by any other utilisation of the Incremental Facility) in
       sub-clause 5.2.1 of Clause 5.2 (Requirements of Incremental Facility
       Request) shall be reduced:

       5.6.1   on each Additional Finance Provider Accession Date, by the amount
               of the Revolving Commitment of the Additional Finance Provider
               which becomes a party hereto on such date; and

       5.6.2   on the date specified in any notice delivered by an Additional
               Finance Provider pursuant to sub-clause 5.4.2 of Clause 5.4
               (Increase of the Revolving Facility) (which notice complies with
               the conditions specified in such sub-clause 5.4.2), by the amount
               of the increase in the Revolving Commitment specified in such
               notice.

5.7    INCREMENTAL FACILITY BALANCE
       Following the accession of all the Additional Finance Providers to this
       Agreement in accordance with Clause 5.5 (Accession of the Additional
       Finance Providers) or receipt by the Agent of a notice from the Parent
       advising that (i) no further Additional Finance Provider will become a
       party to this Agreement and/or (ii) no Additional Finance Provider will
       increase its Commitment under sub-clause 5.4.2, the parties hereto agree
       that Clause 5 (Incremental Facility), except for this Clause 5.7 and
       sub-clause 5.4.2 of Clause 5.4 (Increase of the Revolving Facility),
       shall cease to have effect, save that the balance of the Incremental
       Facility referred to in sub-clause 5.2.1 of Clause 5.2 (Requirements of
       Incremental Facility Request) as reduced pursuant to Clause 5.6
       (Reduction of Incremental Facility) (the "INCREMENTAL FACILITY BALANCE")
       shall remain available for utilisation by the UK Group PROVIDED THAT:

       (a)     no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred
               and is continuing;

       (b)     the Parent supplies the Agent with a certificate stating that the
               Incremental Facility Balance will be made available by a third
               party on terms which are no more onerous (save as to pricing)
               than the terms hereof;

       (c)     each Bank is supplied with a draft of the credit agreement under
               which the Incremental Facility Balance is to be made available
               and the terms of such credit agreement are acceptable to an
               Instructing Group; and



                                       84
<PAGE>

       (d)     such third party enters into an intercreditor agreement
               acceptable to an Instructing Group and the execution of such
               intercreditor agreement shall be a condition precedent to the
               Incremental Facility Balance being made available.


6.     UTILISATION OF THE TERM FACILITY

6.1    DRAWDOWN CONDITIONS FOR THE TERM ADVANCE
       A single Term Advance will be made by the Term Banks to the Post-Novation
       Borrower if:

       6.1.1   during the Notice Period, the Agent has received a completed
               Notice of Drawdown for the entire amount of the Term Facility;

       6.1.2   the proposed date for the making of such Term Advance is a
               Business Day within the Term Availability Period;

       6.1.3   the interest rate applicable to such Term Advance during its
               first Interest Period would not fall to be determined pursuant to
               Clause 9.1 (Market Disruption); and

       6.1.4   on and as of the proposed date for the making of such Term
               Advance (a) no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default is
               continuing, (b) the representations and warranties made pursuant
               to sub-clause 20.1.6 of Clause 20.1 (Representing Parties) are
               true in all material respects and (c) the Agent has given a
               notification pursuant to sub-clause 2.5.2 of Clause 2.5 (Initial
               Conditions Precedent).

6.2    EACH TERM BANK'S PARTICIPATION IN THE TERM ADVANCE
       Each Term Bank will participate through its Facility Office in the Term
       Advance made pursuant to Clause 6.1 (Drawdown Conditions for the Term
       Advance) in the proportion borne by its Term Commitment to the Term
       Facility immediately prior to the making of the Term Advance.

6.3    REDUCTION OF TERM COMMITMENT
       The undrawn Term Commitment of each Term Bank shall, at the close of
       business on the last day of the Term Availability Period, be cancelled
       and each Term Bank's Term Commitment shall be reduced accordingly.


7.     INTEREST PERIODS FOR TERM ADVANCES

7.1    INTEREST PERIODS
       The period for which a Term Advance is outstanding shall be divided into
       successive periods (each an "INTEREST PERIOD") each of which (other than
       the first, which shall begin on the day the Term Advance is made) shall
       start on the last day of the preceding Interest Period.

7.2    DURATION
       The duration of each Interest Period shall, save as otherwise provided
       herein, be one, two, three or six months or such other period as the
       Agent (acting on the instructions of all Term Banks) may agree, in each
       case as the Post-Novation Borrower may by not less than five Business
       Days' prior notice (or such shorter notice period as all the Term Banks
       may agree) to the Agent select, PROVIDED THAT:



                                       85
<PAGE>

       7.2.1   if the Post-Novation Borrower fails to give such notice of its
               selection in relation to an Interest Period, the duration of that
               Interest Period shall, subject to sub-clause 7.2.2 of this Clause
               7.2, be one month;

       7.2.2   in respect of a Term Advance which, after taking into account
               other Term Advances with Interest Periods ending on or before a
               given Term Repayment Date, needs to be applied in whole or in
               part in a repayment of the Term Loan on such Term Repayment Date
               in accordance with Clause 12.1 (Term Repayment Instalments), an
               Interest Period which would otherwise end during the month
               preceding, or extend beyond, that Term Repayment Date shall be of
               such duration that it shall end on that Term Repayment Date.

7.3    CONSOLIDATION OF TERM ADVANCES
       If two or more Interest Periods end at the same time, then, on the last
       day of those Interest Periods, the Term Advances to which they relate
       shall be consolidated into and treated as a single Term Advance.

7.4    DIVISION OF TERM ADVANCES
       The Post-Novation Borrower may, by not less than five Business Days'
       prior notice (or such shorter notice period as all the Term Banks may
       agree) to the Agent, direct that a Term Advance shall, at the beginning
       of any Interest Period relating thereto, be divided into (and thereafter,
       save as otherwise provided herein, treated in all respects as) two or
       more Term Advances in such amounts (in aggregate, equalling the amount of
       the Term Advance being so divided) as shall be specified by the
       Post-Novation Borrower in such notice, PROVIDED THAT the Post-Novation
       Borrower shall not be entitled to make such a direction if any Term
       Advance thereby coming into existence would be of an amount less than
       Pound Sterling50,000,000.


8.     PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON TERM ADVANCES

8.1    PAYMENT OF INTEREST
       On the last day of each Interest Period (and, if such Interest Period
       exceeds six months, on the expiry of each period of six months during
       such Interest Period), the Post-Novation Borrower shall pay accrued
       interest on the Term Advance to which such Interest Period relates.

8.2    CALCULATION OF INTEREST
       The rate of interest applicable to a Term Advance from time to time
       during an Interest Period relating thereto shall be the rate per annum
       which is the sum of:

       (a)     the Term Margin;

       (b)     the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

       (c)     LIBOR.



                                       86
<PAGE>

9.     MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

9.1    MARKET DISRUPTION
       If:

       9.1.1   in relation to any Advance LIBOR is to be determined by reference
               to Reference Banks and at or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation
               Date for the relevant Term or Interest Period none or only one of
               the Reference Banks supplies a rate for the purpose of
               determining LIBOR for the relevant Term or Interest Period; or

       9.1.2   in relation to a Revolving Advance, before the close of business
               in London on the Quotation Date for such Advance the Agent has
               been notified by a Revolving Bank or Revolving Banks to whom in
               aggregate fifty per cent. or more of such Revolving Advance would
               be owed if made, that the LIBOR rate does not accurately reflect
               the cost of funding its participation in such Revolving Advance;
               or

       9.1.3   in relation to a Term Advance, before the close of business in
               London on the Quotation Date for such Advance the Agent has been
               notified by a Term Bank or Terms Banks to whom in aggregate fifty
               per cent. or more of such Term Advance is owed, or would be owed
               if made, that the LIBOR rate does not accurately reflect the cost
               of funding its participation in such Term Advance,

       then the Agent shall notify the Relevant Obligor, the relevant Borrower
       and the Revolving Banks or, as the case may be, the Term Banks of such
       event and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
       Clause 9.2 (Substitute Interest Rate and Substitute Term or Interest
       Period) shall apply to such Advance (if it is a Rollover Advance or a
       Term Advance that is already outstanding). If any of sub-clauses 9.1.1,
       9.1.2 or 9.1.3 of this Clause 9.1 applies to a proposed Advance (other
       than a Rollover Advance), such Advance shall not be made or permitted.

9.2    SUBSTITUTE INTEREST RATE AND SUBSTITUTE TERM OR INTEREST PERIOD
       If sub-clause 9.1.1 of Clause 9.1 (Market Disruption) applies to an
       Advance, the duration of the relevant Term or Interest Period shall be
       one month or, if less, such that it shall end on the earlier of the next
       succeeding Additional Finance Provider Accession Date (if any), the next
       succeeding Revolving Reduction Date or the Revolving Termination Date (in
       the case of a Rollover Advance) or the next succeeding Term Repayment
       Date (in the case of a Term Advance). If any of sub-clauses 9.1.1, 9.1.2
       or 9.1.3 of Clause 9.1 (Market Disruption) applies to an Advance, the
       rate of interest applicable to each Revolving Bank's or, as the case may
       be, each Term Bank's portion of such Advance during the relevant Term or
       Interest Period shall (subject to any agreement reached pursuant to
       Clause 9.3 (Alternative Rate)) be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

       9.2.1   the Revolving Margin at such time or, as the case may be, the
               Term Margin;

       9.2.2   the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

       9.2.3   the rate per annum notified to the Agent by such Revolving Bank
               or such Term Bank before the last day of such Term or Interest
               Period to be that which



                                       87
<PAGE>

               expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to such
               Revolving Bank or Term Bank of funding from whatever sources it
               may reasonably select its portion of such Advance during such
               Term or Interest Period.

9.3    ALTERNATIVE RATE
       If any of those events mentioned in sub-clauses 9.1.1, 9.1.2 and 9.1.3 of
       Clause 9.1 (Market Disruption) occurs in relation to an Advance, then if
       the Agent or the Relevant Obligor so requires, the Agent and the Relevant
       Obligor shall enter into negotiations with a view to agreeing a
       substitute basis (i) for determining the rates of interest from time to
       time applicable to the relevant Advances and/or (ii) upon which the
       relevant Advances may be maintained (whether in sterling or some other
       currency) thereafter and any such substitute basis that is agreed shall
       take effect in accordance with its terms and be binding on each party
       hereto, PROVIDED THAT the Agent may not agree any such substitute basis
       without the prior consent of each Bank (which is not to be unreasonably
       withheld).


10.    NOTIFICATION

10.1   ADVANCES
       The Agent shall, promptly upon its receipt of a Notice of Drawdown,
       notify each Revolving Bank or, as the case may be, each Term Bank of:

       10.1.1  if applicable, the name of the Borrower;

       10.1.2  the proposed amount of the relevant Advance;

       10.1.3  the proposed length of the relevant Term or Interest Period; and

       10.1.4  the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Advance allocated
               to such Bank pursuant to Clause 3.3 (Each Revolving Bank's
               Participation in Revolving Advances) or Clause 6.2 (Each Term
               Bank's Participation in Term Advances).

10.2   INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION
       The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and the Revolving
       Banks or, as the case may be, the Term Banks of each determination of
       LIBOR, the Mandatory Cost Rate, and (in the case of the Revolving Banks)
       of each determination of the Revolving Margin.

10.3   CHANGES TO ADVANCES OR INTEREST RATES
       The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and the Revolving
       Banks or, as the case may be, the Term Banks of any change to (a) the
       proposed length of a Term or Interest Period or (b) any interest rate
       occasioned by the operation of Clause 9 (Market Disruption and
       Alternative Interest Rates).


11.    REPAYMENT AND REDUCTION OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

11.1   REPAYMENT
       Each Borrower to which a Revolving Advance has been made shall repay the

11.2   REDUCTION
       11.2.1  The Revolving Commitments shall be reduced in instalments on each

       11.2.2  The Parent shall, to the extent necessary, procure that
               sufficient Revolving Advances are repaid on a Revolving Reduction
               Date to ensure that the aggregate of the outstanding Revolving
               Advances (after such repayment) is equal to or less than the
               reduced amount of the Total Revolving Commitments.

       11.2.3  Any reduction of the Total Revolving Commitments shall reduce
               proportionately the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Bank.

       11.2.4  If any Borrower cancels the whole or any part of the Revolving
               Commitments in accordance with Clause 13.1 (Cancellation of the
               Revolving Facility) or if the Available Revolving Commitment of
               any Revolving Bank is reduced under sub-clause 13.4.4 of Clause
               13.4 (Prepayment of the Term Loan), Clause 13.7 (No Further
               Advances), Clause 14.7 (Application of Proceeds) or Clause 18
               (Illegality) then the amount of the Revolving Reduction
               Instalment for each Revolving Reduction Date falling after that
               cancellation or reduction will reduce pro rata by the amount
               cancelled.


12.    REPAYMENT OF THE TERM FACILITY

12.1   TERM REPAYMENT INSTALMENTS
       The Post-Novation Borrower shall repay the Term Loan in instalments on

12.2   SELECTION OF TERM ADVANCES
       If, in relation to a Term Repayment Date, the aggregate amount of the
       Term Advances exceeds the amount of the Term Loan to be repaid, the
       Post-Novation Borrower may, by not less than five Business Days' prior
       notice (or such shorter notice period as all the Term Banks may agree) to
       the Agent, select which of those Term Advances will be wholly or
       partially repaid, PROVIDED THAT:

       12.2.1  the Post-Novation Borrower may not make any such selection if, as
               a result, more than one such Term Advance would fall to be
               partially repaid; and

       12.2.2  if the Post-Novation Borrower fails to give such notice, the
               Agent shall select the Term Advances to be wholly or partially
               repaid.


13.    CANCELLATION AND PREPAYMENT

13.1   CANCELLATION OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY
       The Relevant Obligor may, by giving to the Agent not less than five
       Business Days' prior written notice to that effect, cancel the whole or
       any part (being a minimum amount of Pound Sterling 50,000,000 and an
       integral multiple of Pound Sterling 10,000,000) of the Available
       Revolving Facility. Any such cancellation shall reduce the Available
       Revolving Commitment and Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Bank
       rateably. Any amount so cancelled under this Clause 13.1 may not be
       reborrowed.

13.2   PREPAYMENT OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY
       Subject to the provisions of Clause 28.4 (Break Costs), a Borrower to
       which a Revolving Advance has been made may, by giving to the Agent not
       less than five Business Days' prior written notice to that effect, prepay
       the whole or any part of a Revolving Advance (being a minimum amount of
       Pound Sterling 50,000,000 and an integral multiple of Pound
       Sterling 10,000,000).

13.3   NO CANCELLATION OF THE TERM FACILITY
       The Post-Novation Borrower may not cancel the whole or any part of the
       Term Facility during the Term Availability Period.

13.4   PREPAYMENT OF THE TERM LOAN
               13.4.1 Subject to sub-clause 13.4.2, the Post-Novation Borrower
               may, by giving to the Agent not less than five Business Days'
               prior notice (or such shorter notice period as the Term Banks may
               agree) to that effect, prepay the whole or any part of the Term
               Loan (being a minimum amount of Pound Sterling 50,000,000 and an


                                       90
<PAGE>

               integralmultiple of Pound Sterling10,000,000). Any prepayment so
               made shall satisfy pro tanto the Post-Novation Borrower's
               obligations under Clause 12.1 (Term Repayment Instalments) and
               shall be applied rateably to the instalments provided for
               therein.

       13.4.2  If any Term Bank receives any prepayment under sub-clause 13.4.1
               above, the Post-Novation Borrower shall also, in addition to any
               amount payable under Clause 28.4 (Break Costs), pay to the Agent
               for the account of the Term Banks the applicable Term Prepayment
               Amount. No Term Prepayment Amount shall be payable in respect of
               a prepayment required by the Banks (or such of the Banks as may
               be relevant in accordance with Clause 43 (Amendments)) as a
               condition to any consent, amendment or waiver given under the
               Finance Documents.

       13.4.3  Subject to this Clause 13.4 and whilst the Revolving Facility
               subsists, a prepayment may only be made under the Term Facility
               (a "TERM FACILITY PREPAYMENT") if a contemporaneous prepayment is
               made under the Revolving Facility (a "REVOLVING FACILITY
               PREPAYMENT") (in accordance with Clause 13.2 (Prepayment of the
               Revolving Facility) and the amount of the Revolving Facility
               Prepayment bears the same proportion to the sum of the Term
               Facility Prepayment and the Revolving Facility Prepayment as the
               Total Revolving Commitments bears to the Total Commitments at
               that time.

       13.4.4  If, on the day on which the Term Facility Prepayment and the
               Revolving Facility Prepayment are due to be made, the amount of
               the Revolving Facility Prepayment determined under Clause 13.4.3
               exceeds the Revolving Loan, the Revolving Loan shall be prepaid
               in full and the Available Revolving Facility shall be reduced by
               an amount equal to the difference between the Revolving Facility
               Prepayment and the Revolving Loan. Any such cancellation shall
               reduce the Available Revolving Commitment and Revolving
               Commitment of each Revolving Bank rateably. Any amount so prepaid
               or cancelled under this Clause 13.4 may not be reborrowed.

13.5   NOTICE OF CANCELLATION OR PREPAYMENT
       Any notice of cancellation or prepayment given by the Relevant Obligor or
       a Borrower pursuant to this Clause 13 shall be irrevocable, shall specify
       the date upon which such cancellation or prepayment is to be made and the
       amount of such cancellation or prepayment and, in the case of a notice of
       prepayment, shall oblige the relevant Borrower to make such prepayment on
       such date.

13.6   REPAYMENT OF A BANK'S SHARE OF LOAN
       If:

       13.6.1  any sum payable to any Bank by an Obligor is required to be
               increased pursuant to Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-up); or

       13.6.2  any Bank claims indemnification from an Obligor under Clause 15.2
               (Tax Indemnity), the Agent claims indemnification from an Obligor
               under Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) in respect of a payment
               received by it and paid by it to a


                                       91
<PAGE>

               Bank under the Finance Documents, or any Bank claims
               indemnification from a Borrower under Clause 17.1 (Increased
               Costs),

       the Relevant Obligor may, whilst such circumstance continues, give the
       Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice (which notice
       shall be irrevocable) of its intention to procure the repayment of such
       Bank's share of the Loan. On the last day of each then current Term or
       Interest Period, or at any other time subject to the provisions of Clause
       28.4 (Break Costs), each Borrower to which an Advance has been made shall
       repay such Bank's portion of the Advance to which such Term or Interest
       Period relates. Any repayment of a Term Advance under this Clause 13.6
       shall reduce rateably the remaining obligations of the Post-Novation
       Borrower under Clause 12.1 (Term Repayment Instalments).

13.7   NO FURTHER ADVANCES
       A Bank for whose account a repayment is to be made under Clause 13.6
       (Repayment of a Bank's Share of Loan) shall not be obliged to participate
       in the making of Advances on or after the date upon which the Agent
       receives the Relevant Obligor's notice of its intention to procure the
       repayment of such Bank's share of the Loan, and such Bank's Available
       Commitment shall be reduced to zero.

13.8   NO OTHER REPAYMENTS
       No Borrower shall repay all or any part of the Loan except at the times
       and in the manner expressly provided for in this Agreement.


14.    MANDATORY PREPAYMENT

       Clause 14.7 (Application of Proceeds) unless the relevant member of the
       Target Group or, as the case may be, the UK Group can show to the

               to be reinvested in similar or like assets of a comparable or
               superior quality or applied towards the Target Group's or, as the

               (Mandatory Prepayment from Forced Draw Proceeds) (each, a
               "RELEVANT AMOUNT") shall:

               (a)  be retained in the Prepayment Escrow Account pending any
                    withdrawal permitted by any of those Clauses; and

               (b)  if no such right of withdrawal is available, if it has
                    ceased to be available or if the Relevant Obligor so
                    instructs the Agent, be retained in the Prepayment Escrow
                    Account for application on one or more Repayment Dates, or
                    as the case may be, the last day of one or more Interest
                    Periods, until such time as such amounts have been applied
                    in full in repayment of the Loan in accordance with this
                    Clause 14.7.

       14.7.2  Any Relevant Amounts shall, when required to be applied in
               repayment of the Loan in accordance with this Clause 14.7 (and
               then on the dates indicated in sub-clause 14.7.1 above), be
               applied as follows:

               (a)  in prepayment and cancellation of the Revolving Loan by that
                    portion of the Relevant Amount equal to the proportion which
                    the Total Revolving Commitments bear to the Total
                    Commitments (such portion of the Relevant Amount being
                    hereinafter referred to as the "REVOLVING RELEVANT AMOUNT")
                    PROVIDED THAT the Parent may, if this would not give rise to
                    an obligation under the terms of any indebtedness of any
                    member of the Group to apply any such amount in repayment
                    of, or to the offer to repurchase, such indebtedness (a
                    "MANDATORY REPURCHASE OBLIGATION"), apply an amount equal to
                    the amount by which the Revolving Relevant Amount exceeds
                    the Revolving Loan in payment to the relevant member of the
                    UK Group (with a corresponding cancellation of the Available
                    Revolving Facility in an amount equal to the amount of such
                    payment), and for these purposes, if not to do so would give
                    rise to a Mandatory Repurchase Obligation, the Parent shall
                    ensure that on the date on which the Revolving Relevant
                    Amount is due to be applied in accordance with this
                    sub-clause 14.7.2, the amount of the Revolving Loan shall be
                    at least equal to the Relevant Revolving Amount; and

               (b)  in prepayment of the Term Loan by that portion of the
                    Relevant Amount equal to the proportion which the Total Term
                    Commitments bears to the Total Commitments.

       14.7.3      (i) Unless this would give rise to a Mandatory Repurchase
                   Obligation, a Term Bank may, at its option, elect to waive
                   receipt of its portion of a Relevant Amount, in which case
                   such amount shall be applied to reduce the Revolving Loan in
                   accordance with paragraph (a) of sub-clause 14.7.2.

                   (ii) Any prepayment of the Term Loan made pursuant to this
                   Clause 14.7 shall satisfy pro tanto the Post-Novation
                   Borrower's obligations under Clause

                   12.1 (Term Repayment Instalments) and shall be applied
                   rateably to the instalments provided for therein.

       14.7.4  Any amount of the Loan repaid in accordance with this Clause 14.7
               may not be reborrowed. Any cancellation of the Available
               Revolving Facility in accordance with this Clause 14.7 shall
               reduce the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Bank rateably
               and the amount so cancelled may not be reborrowed.

                         issued share capital as a result of a Permitted
                         Issuance,

               then the Parent and, prior to the Pushdown Date, the CWC Parent
               and the Pre-Novation Borrower shall procure the immediate
               repayment of the Loan in full (together with accrued interest
               thereon and any other sums then owed by the Borrowers hereunder)
               and the Available Commitment of each Bank shall immediately be
               cancelled and reduced to zero.

                          or other equivalent officers of NTL Holdings are
                          obliged to comply with; or

               obtain or consolidate control of NTL Holdings.

       14.8.3  This Clause 14.8 will not apply, and the Available Commitments
               will not be cancelled, and the Loan will not become due and
               payable in the event that:

               (a)  France Telecom S.A. or any of its affiliates acquires

       thereon and any other sums then owed by the Borrowers hereunder), on the
       first Business Day after 20 July 2001, and the Available Commitment of
       each Bank shall immediately be cancelled and reduced to zero.


15.    TAXES

15.1   TAX GROSS-UP

       All payments to be made by an Obligor to any Finance Party under the
       Finance Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction
       for or on account of tax unless such Obligor is required by law to make
       such a payment subject to the deduction or withholding of tax, in which
       case the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of which such deduction
       or withholding is required to be made) shall, subject to Clause 15.4
       (Excluded Claims), be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that
       such Finance Party receives a sum net of any deduction or withholding
       equal to the sum which it would have received had no such deduction or
       withholding been made or required to be made.

15.2   TAX INDEMNITY

       Without prejudice to Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-up), if the Agent or (as a
       result of the introduction of, or change in or in the interpretation,
       administration or application of, any law or regulation or order or
       governmental rule or double taxation agreement or any published practice
       or concession of any relevant taxing authority after the date hereof) any
       Bank (a) is required to make any payment of or on account of tax on or in
       relation to any sum received or receivable under the Finance Documents
       (including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be received or
       receivable by such Finance Party, whether or not actually received or
       receivable) or (b) has any liability in respect of any such payment
       asserted, imposed, levied or assessed against it, the relevant Obligor
       shall, within five Business Days of demand by the Agent, promptly
       indemnify the Agent or


                                       97
<PAGE>

       Bank which suffers a loss or liability as a result against such payment
       or liability, together with any interest, penalties, costs and expenses
       payable or incurred in connection therewith, PROVIDED THAT this Clause
       15.2 shall not apply to:

       15.2.1  any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net income,
               profits or gains actually received or receivable by the Agent or
               such Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any sum
               deemed for purposes of tax to be received or receivable by the
               Agent or such Bank but not actually receivable) by the
               jurisdiction in which the Agent or such Bank is incorporated or,
               if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which the
               Agent or such Bank is treated as resident for tax purposes; or

       15.2.2  any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net income,
               profits or gains of the Facility Office of the Agent or such Bank
               actually received or receivable by the Agent or such Bank (but,
               for the avoidance of doubt, not including any sum deemed for
               purposes of tax to be received or receivable by the Agent or such
               Bank but not actually receivable) by the jurisdiction in which
               its Facility Office is located; or

       15.2.3  for the avoidance of doubt, any tax imposed on a Bank which would
               not have arisen but for the sub-participation of its rights and
               benefits under any of the Finance Documents.

15.3   CLAIMS BY BANKS AND THE AGENT

       A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity)
       shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to the claim, whereupon
       the Agent shall notify the Relevant Obligor and the Borrowers thereof. If
       the Agent intends to make a claim pursuant to Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity)
       it shall notify the Relevant Obligor and the Borrowers of the event
       giving rise to the claim.

15.4   EXCLUDED CLAIMS

       If any Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender, no
       Obligor shall be liable to pay to that Finance Party under Clause 15.1
       (Tax Gross-Up) any amount in respect of taxes levied or imposed in excess
       of the amount it would have been obliged to pay if that Finance Party had
       been or had not ceased to be a Qualifying Lender PROVIDED THAT this
       Clause 15.4 shall not apply (and each Obligor shall be obliged to comply
       with its obligations under Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up)) if:

       15.4.1  after the date hereof, there shall have been any introduction of,
               or change in or in the interpretation, administration or
               application of, any law or regulation or order or governmental
               rule or double taxation agreement or any published practice or
               concession of any relevant taxing authority and as a result
               thereof such Finance Party ceases to be a Qualifying Lender; or

       15.4.2  such Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender as
               a result of the actions of any Obligor.

15.5   TREATY LENDERS

       A Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that
       Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural
       formalities necessary for that


                                       98
<PAGE>

       Obligor to obtain authorisation to make that payment without a deduction
       or withholding for or on account of tax. If an Obligor is able to
       demonstrate that a deduction or withholding for or on account of tax is
       required to be made by it as a result of a Treaty Lender's failure to so
       co-operate, such an Obligor shall not be liable to pay any increased
       amount under Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up) as a result of such a deduction
       or withholding.

15.6   NOTIFICATION OF STATUS

       Each Bank shall notify the Agent if it is not a Qualifying Lender at the
       time it becomes a Bank hereunder or, if it is then a Qualifying Lender,
       shall promptly notify the Agent if at any time thereafter it ceases to be
       a Qualifying Lender. The Agent shall promptly notify the Relevant Obligor
       of any notices it receives under this Clause 15.6 and if it ceases to be
       a Qualifying Lender.


16.    TAX RECEIPTS

16.1   NOTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT TO DEDUCT TAX

       If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction or
       withholding from any sum payable by it under the Finance Documents (or if
       thereafter there is any change in the rates at which or the manner in
       which such deductions or withholdings are calculated), such Obligor and
       the Bank to which such sum is payable shall promptly upon becoming aware
       of such a requirement notify the Agent accordingly. If the Agent receives
       such a notification from a Bank it shall promptly notify the Relevant
       Obligor and the Obligor who is required to make such a deduction or
       withholding.

16.2   EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT OF TAX

       If an Obligor makes any payment under the Finance Documents in respect of
       which it is required to make any deduction or withholding, it shall pay
       the full amount required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant
       taxation or other authority within the time allowed for such payment
       under applicable law and shall request and, within thirty days of it
       receiving the same, deliver to the Agent for each relevant Bank an
       original receipt (or a certified copy thereof) issued by such authority
       evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so required to be
       deducted or withheld in respect of that Bank's share of such payment.

16.3   TAX CREDIT PAYMENT

       If an additional payment is made under Clause 15 (Taxes) by an Obligor
       for the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance Party, in its sole
       discretion, determines that it has obtained (and has derived full use and
       benefit from) a credit against, a relief or remission for, or repayment
       of, any tax, then, if and to the extent that such Finance Party, in its
       sole opinion, determines that such credit, relief, remission or repayment
       is in respect of or calculated with reference to or otherwise relates to
       the additional payment made pursuant to Clause 15 (Taxes), such Finance
       Party shall, to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to the
       retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment,
       pay to such Obligor such amount as such Finance Party shall, in its sole
       opinion, determine to be the amount which will leave such Finance Party
       (after such payment) in no worse after-tax position than it would have
       been in had the additional payment in question not been required to be
       made by such Obligor.


                                       99
<PAGE>

16.4   TAX CREDIT CLAWBACK

       If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor pursuant to Clause
       16.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and such Finance Party subsequently determines,
       in its sole opinion, that the credit, relief, remission or repayment in
       respect of which such payment was made was not available or has been
       withdrawn or that it was unable to use such credit, relief, remission or
       repayment in full, such Obligor shall reimburse such Finance Party such
       amount as such Finance Party determines, in its sole opinion, is
       necessary to place it in the same after-tax position as it would have
       been in if such credit, relief, remission or repayment had been obtained
       and fully used and retained by such Finance Party.

16.5   TAX AND OTHER AFFAIRS

       No provision of this Agreement shall interfere with the right of any
       Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever manner
       it thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit, relief,
       remission or repayment in respect of any payment under Clause 15 (Taxes)
       in priority to any other credit, relief, remission or repayment available
       to it nor oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating
       to its tax or other affairs or any computations in respect thereof.


17.    INCREASED COSTS

17.1   INCREASED COSTS

       If, by reason of the occurrence, in each case after the date hereof, of
       (a) any change in law or in its interpretation or administration and/or
       (b) compliance with any such new law or with any request or requirement
       relating to the maintenance of capital or any other request from or
       requirement of any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other
       authority (in each case, where a request or requirement that does not
       have the force of law is a request or requirement with which financial
       institutions subject to such request or requirement are generally
       accustomed to comply):

       17.1.1  a Bank or any holding company of such Bank is unable to obtain
               the rate of return on its capital which it would have been able
               to obtain but for such Bank's entering into or assuming or
               maintaining a commitment or performing its obligations under the
               Finance Documents;

       17.1.2  a Bank or any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost as a
               result of such Bank's entering into or assuming or maintaining a
               commitment or performing its obligations under the Finance
               Documents; or

       17.1.3  there is any increase in the cost to a Bank or any holding
               company of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's share
               of the Advances or any Unpaid Sum,

       then the Borrower(s) of the relevant Facility (acting through the
       Relevant Obligor) shall, within three Business Days of a demand of the
       Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of that Bank amounts sufficient
       to indemnify that Bank or to enable that Bank to indemnify its holding
       company from and against, as the case may be, (i) such reduction in the
       rate of return of capital, (ii) such cost or (iii) such increased cost.


                                      100
<PAGE>

17.2   INCREASED COSTS CLAIMS

       A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 17.1 (Increased
       Costs) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to such claim,
       whereupon the Agent shall notify the Relevant Obligor thereof.

17.3   EXCLUSIONS

       Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 17, no Bank shall
       be entitled to make any claim under this Clause 17 in respect of any
       reduction in the rate of return on capital, cost or increased cost:

       17.3.1  attributable to a deduction or withholding for or on account of
               tax from a payment under a Finance Document required by law to be
               made by an Obligor and compensated for pursuant to the provisions
               of Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up) (or would have been compensated for
               under Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-Up) but was not so compensated
               solely because of Clause 15.4 (Excluded Claims) or Clause 15.5
               (Treaty Lenders));

       17.3.2  compensated by Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) (or would have been
               compensated for under Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) but was not so
               compensated solely because of one of the exclusions set out in
               sub-clauses 15.2.1 to 15.2.3 of Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity));

       17.3.3  compensated by the Mandatory Cost Rate; or

       17.3.4  attributable to the wilful breach by the relevant Finance Party
               or its affiliates of any law or regulation.


18.    ILLEGALITY

       If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make, fund
       or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its share of the Advances,
       then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming aware of the same, deliver
       to the Relevant Obligor through the Agent a notice to that effect and:

       18.1.1  such Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to participate in the
               making of any Advances and the amount of its Available Commitment
               shall be immediately reduced to zero; and

       18.1.2  if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, each Borrower
               which has drawn an Advance shall no later than the last day
               permitted by law repay such Bank's share of any outstanding
               Advances together with accrued interest thereon and all other
               amounts owing to such Bank under the Finance Documents and any
               repayment of Term Advances so made shall reduce rateably the
               remaining obligations of the Post-Novation Borrower under Clause
               12.1 (Term Repayment Instalments).

19.    MITIGATION

       If, in respect of any Bank, circumstances arise which would or would upon
       the giving of notice result in:


                                      101
<PAGE>

       19.1.1  an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account pursuant
               to Clause 15.1 (Tax Gross-up);

       19.1.2  a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 15.2 (Tax
               Indemnity) or Clause 17.1 (Increased Costs); or

       19.1.3  the reduction of its Available Commitment to zero or any
               repayment to be made pursuant to Clause 18 (Illegality),

       then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the
       rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors or the Relevant
       Obligor under any of the Clauses referred to above, such Bank shall
       promptly upon becoming aware of such circumstances notify the Agent
       thereof and, in consultation with the Agent and the Relevant Obligor and
       to the extent that it can do so lawfully, take reasonable steps
       (including a change of location of its Facility Office or the transfer of
       its rights, benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents to
       another financial institution acceptable to the Relevant Obligor and
       willing to participate in any Facility in which such Bank has
       participated) to mitigate the effects of such circumstances, PROVIDED
       THAT such Bank shall be under no obligation to take any such action if,
       in the opinion of such Bank, to do so might have any adverse effect upon
       its business, operations or financial condition (other than any minor
       costs and expenses of an administrative nature).


20.    REPRESENTATIONS

20.1   REPRESENTING PARTIES

       20.1.1  Each Obligor makes the representations and warranties set out in

               Material Proceedings), Clause 20.13 (No Material Adverse Change),

       knowledge and belief) is threatened against the Pre-Novation Borrower,
       any member of the UK Group or any member of the Target Group where such

                                      109
<PAGE>

       determined against the Pre-Novation Borrower or such other member of the

               or treaty to which it is party or which is binding upon it or any
               of its assets in a manner that could reasonably be expected to
               have a Material Adverse Effect;

       20.21.2 conflict with its constitutive documents and rules and

       licences (including, without limitation, the Licences), permissions,
       authorisations and consents (each an "APPROVAL") required for the conduct
       of its business as carried on from time to time, and all such approvals
       are valid and subsisting save in any such case where failure to obtain
       such an approval or the invalidity of such an approval or its failure to
       subsist could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
       Effect and to the best of its knowledge and belief (having made, with
       respect to the UK Group only, due and careful enquiry) there has been no
       act or omission on the part of it or, as the case may be, any Target
       Group member or any UK Group member, which is likely to give rise to the
       enforcement, revocation, material amendment, suspension, withdrawal or
       avoidance of any of the approvals or any of the material terms or
       conditions thereof, which enforcement, revocation, amendment, withdrawal,
       suspension or avoidance could reasonably be expected to have a Material
       Adverse Effect.

20.26  SECURITY INTEREST

       20.26.1 Subject (in each case) to the Reservations, each Security
               Document and Second Security Document creates the security
               interest which that Security Document or Second Security Document
               purports to create or, if that Security Document or Second
               Security Document purports to evidence a security interest,
               accurately evidences a security interest which has been validly
               created and each security interest ranks in priority (save in
               respect of, if and to the extent applicable, Permitted
               Encumbrances) as specified in the Security Document creating or
               evidencing that interest.

       20.26.2 Save as disclosed in the Disclosure Letter, the shares of any UK
               Group or Target Group member which are subject to an Encumbrance

               fully paid and not subject to any option to purchase or similar
               rights and the constitutional documents of any such UK Group or
               Target Group member do not and could not restrict or inhibit
               (whether absolutely, partly, under a discretionary power or
               otherwise) any transfer of such shares pursuant to enforcement of
               the Security Documents or the Second Security Documents.

       20.26.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the Security is intended to secure
               all amounts outstanding under the Finance Documents from time to
               time, including without limitation, all amounts made available by
               the Term Banks and the Additional Finance Providers.

                    change, such determination to be binding on the parties

               event, no later than ten Business Days after the Pushdown
               Condition is satisfied, steps (a) to (g) of the definition of the

                    set out in this Clause 23 with the overriding objective of

                    practicable after the Acquisition Date; and

               (b)  does not enter into any transaction or do anything which
                    would require it to utilise any such permissions or

                    the definitions of Permitted Acquisitions, Permitted

                    entering into the transaction or first doing such thing in
                    reliance upon such permission or exception, such transaction
                    or thing could be reasonably expected to delay the Pushdown.

23.20  UNWINDING OF ACTIONS

       If, at any time:

       23.20.1 it is reasonably likely that by doing so it will enable Pushdown
               to occur at a date earlier than that on which it could otherwise
               occur; and

       23.20.2 if the Agent (acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group)
               so requires,

       the Pre-Novation Borrower and the CWC Parent shall, and the CWC Parent
       shall procure that each member of the Target Group shall, use its
       reasonable endeavours to repay any indebtedness incurred by it after the
       Execution Date (including, without limitation, the unwinding of any

       needs to be repaid to satisfy the Pushdown Condition.

               in the Parent by way of Subordinated Funding and so applied in
               mandatory prepayment of the amount outstanding under the Working
               Capital Facility;

       23.22.2 to the extent that such amount is required, pursuant to the
               Working Capital Facility to be applied in mandatory cancellation

               cancellation thereof:

       23.32.1 Prior to the Pushdown Date, and once the members of the Target
               Group required to do so pursuant to Clause 23.17
               (Post-Acquisition Date Security) have acceded hereto as
               Guarantors, the CWC Parent and the Pre-Novation Borrower shall
               ensure that, save to the extent that it is unable to do so as a
               result of the application of the proviso to sub-clause 23.17.1 of
               Clause 23.17 (Post Acquisition Date Security), at all times the
               aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors (in each case calculated on an
               unconsolidated basis) for each Financial Quarter ended on or
               before the Pushdown Date equals or exceeds 90 per cent. of the
               consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group for such period.

       23.32.2 After the Pushdown Date, the Parent shall ensure that at all
               times the aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors (in each case
               calculated on an unconsolidated basis) for any period of four
               consecutive Financial Quarters equals or exceeds 95 per cent. of
               the consolidated EBITDA of the UK Group for such period.

       23.32.3 For the purposes of this Clause 23.32 the aggregate EBITDA of the
               Guarantors and the consolidated EBITDA of the UK Group at any
               time after the Pushdown Date:

               (a)  prior to the delivery of the financial statements for the
                    first Financial Quarter ended after the Pushdown Date, shall
                    be equal to the aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors or, as
                    the case may be, the aggregate EBITDA of the UK Group and
                    the Target Group for the four Financial Quarters ended
                    before the Pushdown Date or, if less, the number of
                    Financial Quarters between the Execution Date and the
                    Pushdown Date annualised by multiplying by the relevant
                    fraction;

               (b)  after the delivery of the financial statements for the first
                    Financial Quarter ended after the Pushdown Date, shall be
                    equal to the aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors or, as the
                    case may be the aggregate EBITDA of the UK Group for that
                    Financial Quarter, multiplied by four;

               (c)  after the delivery of the financial statements for the first
                    two Financial Quarters ended after the Pushdown Date, shall
                    be equal to the aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors or, as
                    the case may be the aggregate EBITDA of the UK Group for
                    those Financial Quarters, multiplied by two;

               (d)  after the delivery of the financial statements for the first
                    three Financial Quarters ended after the Pushdown Date,
                    shall be equal to the aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors or,
                    as the case may be, the aggregate EBITDA of the UK Group for
                    those Financial Quarters, multiplied by four and divided by
                    three; and

               (e)  after the delivery of the financial statements for the first
                    four Financial Quarters ended after the Pushdown Date, shall
                    be equal to the aggregate EBITDA of the Guarantors or, as
                    the case may be the aggregate EBITDA of the UK Group for the
                    immediately preceding four complete Financial Quarters.

       23.32.4 A breach of this Clause 23.32 shall not constitute an Event of
               Default if (i) one or more subsidiaries of the Parent or, as the
               case may be, the CWC Parent become Guarantors (in accordance with
               Clause 38 (Accession of Guarantors and the CWC Parent)), within
               five Business Days of the earlier of notice by the Agent to the
               Relevant Obligor of the breach and the Relevant Obligor becoming
               aware thereof and (ii) the Agent (acting reasonably) is satisfied
               that this Clause 23.32 will, as a result of the Guarantors
               thereby created, be satisfied.

               same day as the Parent's financial year; or

       23.36.3 so as to ensure that the financial year of any member of the UK
               Group or the Target Group ends on the same date as the financial

               accordance with sub-clause 23.17.2 of Clause 23.17
               (Post-Acquisition Date Security), to the extent that such details
               are reasonably required to enable those assets to be sufficiently

       Upon receipt of the schedule referred to in sub-clause 23.39.1 the Agent
       (acting reasonably and in consultation with the CWC Parent) shall

24.    EVENTS OF DEFAULT

       Each of Clause 24.1 (Failure to Pay) to Clause 24.17 (Material Adverse
       Change) describes circumstances which constitute an Event of Default for
       the purposes of this Agreement. Clause 24.18 (Acceleration and
       Cancellation) and Clause 24.19 (Advances Due on Demand) deal with the
       rights of the Agent and the Banks after the occurrence of an Event of
       Default.

24.1   FAILURE TO PAY

       Any of the Obligors fails to pay any sum due from it under any of the
       Finance Documents to which it is a party at the time, in the currency and
       in the manner specified therein unless:

       24.1.1  the sum is of a principal amount which was not paid as a result
               of a technical error or failure in the transmission of funds and
               that payment is then received by the Agent within one Business
               Day of the due date;

       24.1.2  the sum is of an amount of interest and that payment is then
               received by the Agent within three Business Days of the due date;
               or

       24.1.3  the sum is of an amount other than principal or interest and that
               payment is then received by the Agent within five Business Days
               of the due date.

24.2   MISREPRESENTATION

       Any representation or statement made or repeated by NTL CC, the Parent,
       the CWC Parent or any Obligor in any of the Finance Documents or in any
       notice or other document or certificate delivered by it pursuant thereto
       or in connection therewith is or proves to have been incorrect or
       misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be made and the
       circumstances giving rise to such inaccuracy, if capable of remedy or
       change, are not remedied or do not change, such that the relevant
       representation or statement would be correct and not misleading if
       repeated five Business Days after the earlier of (a) it being notified by
       the Agent to NTL CC in the case of a representation or statement by NTL
       CC, and to the Group Representative in all other cases, as having been
       made inaccurately and (b) NTL CC, the Parent, the CWC Parent or the
       relevant Obligor becoming aware of such inaccuracy.

24.3   SPECIFIC COVENANTS

       NTL CC, the Parent, the CWC Parent or any of the Obligors fails to comply
       with any of its obligations under Clause 21 (Financial Information) or

       (Specific Covenants) shall occur in relation to:

       24.3.1  Clause 21.1 (Annual Statements) to Clause 21.9 (Other Financial
               Information) or Clause 21.11 (General Information) to Clause
               21.13 (Acquisition Information), if the failure to comply with
               such is remedied within five Business Days of the Agent giving
               notice thereof to the Group Representative;


       24.3.2  Clause 23 (Covenants), if the failure to comply with such is
               capable of remedy and is remedied within five Business Days of
               the date on which NTL CC, the Parent, the CWC Parent or, as the
               case may be, the relevant Obligor became


                                      142

               date on which either NTL CC or the Parent becomes aware of such

       thirty days after the Agent has given notice thereof to NTL CC, the
       Parent, the CWC Parent or, in the case of any Obligor, the Group
       Representative.

       Borrowers (acting through the Relevant Obligor) shall pay to the Agent on
       demand for account of such Bank an amount equal to the amount (if any) by
       which (a) the additional interest which would have been payable on the

       last day of that Term or Interest Period exceeds (b) the amount of
       interest which in the opinion of the Agent would have been payable to the
       Agent on the last day of that Term or Interest Period in respect of a
       deposit in the currency of the amount so received or recovered equal to
       the amount so received or recovered placed by it with a prime bank in

       The order of partial payments set out in Clause 31.6 (Partial Payments)

31.8   BUSINESS DAYS

       31.8.1  Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a
               Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same
               calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day
               (if there is not).

       31.8.2  During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal
               or an Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest is payable on the
               principal at the rate payable on the original due date.


32.    SET-OFF

32.1   CONTRACTUAL SET-OFF

       Each Obligor authorises each Bank, at any time any sum is due and payable
       hereunder and remains unpaid, to apply any credit balance to which such
       Obligor is entitled on any account of such Obligor with such Bank in
       satisfaction of any sum due and payable from such Obligor to such Bank
       under the Finance Documents but unpaid. For this purpose, each Bank is
       authorised to purchase with the moneys standing to the credit of any such
       account such other currencies as may be necessary to effect such
       application.

32.2   SET-OFF NOT MANDATORY

       No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause 32.1
       (Contractual Set-off).


33.    SHARING

33.1   PAYMENTS TO BANKS

       If a Bank (a "RECOVERING BANK") applies any receipt or recovery from an
       Obligor to a payment due under this Agreement and such amount is received
       or recovered other than in accordance with Clause 31 (Payments), then
       such Recovering Bank shall:

       33.1.1  notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery;

       33.1.2  at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an amount
               (the "SHARING PAYMENT") equal to such receipt or recovery less
               any amount which the Agent determines may be retained by such
               Recovering Bank as its share of any payment to be made in
               accordance with Clause 31.6 (Partial Payments).

33.2   REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

       The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the
       relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other
       than the Recovering Bank) in accordance with Clause 31.6 (Partial
       Payments).

33.3   RECOVERING BANK'S RIGHTS

       The Recovering Bank will be subrogated into the rights of the parties
       which have shared in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 33.2
       (Redistribution of Payments) in respect of the Sharing Payment (and the
       relevant Obligor shall be liable to the Recovering Bank in an amount
       equal to the Sharing Payment).

33.4   REPAYABLE RECOVERIES

       If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering
       Bank becomes repayable and is repaid by such Recovering Bank, then:


                                      158
<PAGE>

       33.4.1  each party which has received a share of such Sharing Payment
               pursuant to Clause 33.2 (Redistribution of Payments) shall, upon
               request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of such
               Recovering Bank an amount equal to its share of such Sharing
               Payment; and

       33.4.2  such Recovering Bank's rights of subrogation in respect of any
               reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant Obligor will be
               liable to the reimbursing party for the amount so reimbursed.

33.5   EXCEPTION

       This Clause 33 shall not apply if the Recovering Bank would not, after
       making any payment pursuant hereto, have a valid and enforceable claim
       against the relevant Obligor.

33.6   RECOVERIES THROUGH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

       If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court it shall give
       prior notice to the Agent and the other Banks. If any Bank shall commence
       any action in any court to enforce its rights hereunder and, as a result
       thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount, then such Bank
       shall not be required to share any portion of such amount with any Bank
       which has the legal right to, but does not, join in such action or
       commence and diligently prosecute a separate action to enforce its rights
       in another court.

33.7   SECURED HEDGING AGREEMENTS

       The Parent shall provide the Agent with, as soon as is reasonably
       practicable after the same are entered into, copies of the Secured
       Hedging Agreements entered into by either it or any member of the UK
       Group pursuant to Clause 23.38 (Hedging). The Parent and each Hedge
       Counterparty shall ensure that each Secured Hedging Agreement to which
       (a) (in the case of the Parent) it or any other member of the UK Group is
       a party or (b) (in the case of a Hedge Counterparty) it is a party:

       33.7.1  provides for "two-way payments" in the event of a termination of
               a hedging transaction entered into pursuant to a Secured Hedging
               Agreement whether upon a termination event or an event of default
               (each as defined in the Secured Hedging Agreement), meaning that
               the defaulting party under that Secured Hedging Agreement will be
               entitled to receive payment under the relevant termination
               provisions if the net replacement value of all terminated
               transactions effected under the Hedging Agreement is in its
               favour; and

       33.7.2  includes as an event of default (as defined in the Secured
               Hedging Agreement) an Event of Default.

33.8   TERMINATION OF SECURED HEDGING AGREEMENTS

       Each Hedge Counterparty shall:

       33.8.1  if (a) any hedging transaction under any Secured Hedging
               Agreement to which it is party is terminated, (b) a settlement
               amount or other amount falls due from it to any member of the UK
               Group under such a Secured Hedging Agreement and (c) the Security
               has become, and remains at the proposed date of payment
               enforceable, pay such settlement amount to the Security Trustee;
               and


                                      159
<PAGE>

       33.8.2  unless the Agent otherwise instructs it, exercise any rights it
               may have to terminate the hedging transactions under the Secured
               Hedging Agreements to which it is party as soon as is reasonably
               practicable after the date on which the Agent declares all or any
               part of the Advances to be immediately due and payable in
               accordance with either Clause 24.18 (Acceleration and
               Cancellation) or Clause 24.19 (Advances Due on Demand).

33.9   RIGHTS OF HEDGE COUNTERPARTIES

       Whilst any Obligor has any actual or contingent liabilities under the
       Finance Documents, except with the prior consent of the Agent (acting on
       the instructions of an Instructing Group), no Hedge Counterparty will:

       33.9.1  demand or receive payment, prepayment (other than a prepayment
               arising due to the prepayment of an Advance permitted by this
               Agreement), repayment, or any distribution in respect of or on
               account of any of the Hedging Liabilities in cash or in kind or
               apply any money or property in or towards the discharge of any
               Hedging Liabilities except for:

               (a)  scheduled payments arising under the terms of the Secured
                    Hedging Agreements; and

               (b)  the proceeds of enforcement of the Security Documents
                    received and applied in the order permitted by the Security
                    Trust Agreement;

       33.9.2  exercise any right it might otherwise have pursuant to any
               Secured Hedging Agreement to terminate any hedging transactions
               under such Secured Hedging Agreement or to refuse to make any
               payment due from it under such hedging transactions until the
               Agent declares all or any part of the Advances to be immediately
               due and payable in accordance with either Clause 24.18
               (Acceleration and Cancellation) or Clause 24.19 (Advances Due on
               Demand);

       33.9.3  discharge all or any part of the Hedging Liabilities by set-off,
               any right of combination of accounts or otherwise except if and
               to the extent that those Hedging Liabilities are permitted to be
               paid under sub-clause 33.9.1(a); or

       33.9.4  take, accept or receive the benefit of any Encumbrance or
               guarantee in respect of the Hedging Liabilities other than under
               (a) the Finance Documents or (b) any other Encumbrance or
               guarantee granted for the full benefit of the Finance Parties.

33.10  AMENDMENT OF SECURED HEDGING AGREEMENTS

       Except with the prior written consent of the Agent (acting on the
       instructions of an Instructing Group), neither a member of the UK Group
       nor a Hedge Counterparty will amend, vary, supplement or allow to be
       superseded any provision of the Secured Hedging Agreements which would
       result in:

       33.10.1 any provision in the Secured Hedging Agreements being amended
               unless the Hedge Counterparty concerned, acting reasonably and in
               good faith, certifies to the Agent that it considers such
               amendment does not impose restrictions or


                                      160
<PAGE>

               obligations or conditions on any member of the UK Group which are
               more onerous than those originally provided for in the Secured
               Hedging Agreements;

       33.10.2 any payment under the Secured Hedging Agreements being required
               to be made by a member of the UK Group earlier than the date
               originally provided for in the Secured Hedging Agreements (except
               where that payment is made as a result of the prepayment of an
               Advance permitted by this Agreement); or

       33.10.3 any member of the UK Group becoming liable to make an additional
               payment (or increase an existing payment) under any of the
               Secured Hedging Agreements, where such liability does not arise
               from the original provisions of the Secured Hedging Agreements.

               power, authority or discretion vested herein upon an Instructing

       34.2.5  rely upon any communication or document believed by it to be
               genuine;

       34.2.6  refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion vested in

               Instructing Group as to whether or not such right, power or
               discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to be exercised, as
               to the manner in which it should be exercised;

       34.2.7  refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of an
               Instructing Group to begin any legal action or proceeding arising

               have received such security as it may require (whether by way of
               payment in advance or otherwise) for all costs, claims, losses,
               expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with any
               VAT thereon which it will or may expend or incur in complying
               with such instructions; and

       34.2.8  assume (unless it has specific notice to the contrary) that any
               notice or request made by the Relevant Obligor is made on behalf
               of all the Obligors.

34.3   AGENT'S OBLIGATIONS

       The Agent shall:

       34.3.1  promptly inform each Bank of the contents of any written notice
               or document received by it in its capacity as Agent from the
               Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC or an Obligor under the Finance
               Documents;

       34.3.2  promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of any Event of
               Default or any default by an Obligor in the due performance of or

               may be), which instructions shall be binding on the Arrangers and
               the Banks;

       34.3.6  if so instructed by an Instructing Group (or if specifically
               provided for in the Finance Documents, Term Instructing Group or

       The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical and
       administrative in nature.

34.4   EXCLUDED OBLIGATIONS

       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
       neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall:

       34.4.1  be bound to enquire as to (a) whether or not any representation
               made or deemed to be made by the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC
               or an Obligor in connection with the Finance Documents is true,
               (b) the occurrence or otherwise of any Event of Default or
               Potential Event of Default, (c) the performance by either the
               Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC or an Obligor of its obligations
               under the Finance Documents or (d) any breach of or default by
               either the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC or an Obligor of or
               under its obligations under the Finance Documents;

       34.4.2  be bound to account to any Bank for any sum or the profit element
               of any sum received by it for its own account;

       34.4.3  be bound to disclose to any other person any information relating
               to any member of the Group if (a) such information is
               confidential or (b) such disclosure would or might in its
               reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or a breach of
               fiduciary duty;

       34.4.4  be under any obligations other than those for which express
               provision is made herein; or

       34.4.5  be or be deemed to be a fiduciary for any other party hereto.

34.5   DELEGATION

       The Agent may delegate, transfer or assign to any of its holding
       companies, subsidiaries or subsidiaries of any of its holding companies
       all or any of the rights, powers, authorities and discretions vested in
       it under the Finance Documents and the performance of its duties in
       accordance therewith, and such delegation, transfer or assignment may be
       made upon such terms and subject to such conditions (including the power
       to sub-delegate) and subject to such regulations as the Agent may think
       fit (and the term "Agent" as used in this Agreement shall include any
       such delegate).

34.6   INDEMNIFICATION

       Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by the
       Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims, losses,
       expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with any VAT
       thereon which the Agent may incur, otherwise than by reason of its own
       gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in its capacity as agent
       under the Finance Documents (other than any which have been reimbursed by
       the Borrowers pursuant to Clause 29.1 (Borrowers' Indemnity)).

34.7   EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES

       Each Revolving Bank confirms that it has read the Notice to Recipients in
       the Information Memorandum, that it has complied with the Recipients'
       Obligations (as set out in the Notice to Recipients) and, accordingly,
       that it enters into this Agreement on the


                                      163
<PAGE>

       basis of the Notice to Recipients. In particular, each of the Banks
       accepts that it is entering into this Agreement in reliance only on the
       representations of the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC and the Obligors in
       this Agreement and on its own investigations, that it has not relied on
       the Arrangers and that, except as set out below, it neither has nor will
       have any claims against the Arrangers arising from or in connection with
       this Agreement. Similarly, each of the Revolving Banks accepts that the
       Notice to Recipients in the Information Memorandum is applicable also to
       the Agent as if the Agent had been named in addition to the Arrangers in
       the Important Notice.

       Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the
       Agent nor any Arranger accepts any responsibility to any of the Banks:

       34.7.1  for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information
               Memorandum or any other information supplied by the Agent or the
               Arrangers, by the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC or an Obligor or
               by any other person in connection with the Finance Documents or
               any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made
               or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
               the Finance Documents;

       34.7.2  for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
               enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other agreement,
               arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
               anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the Finance
               Documents; or

       34.7.3  for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any judgement,
               discretion or power given to any of them by or in connection with
               the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or
               document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
               pursuant to or in connection with the Finance Documents.

       Accordingly, neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall be under any

       matters, save in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

34.8   NO ACTIONS

       Each of the Banks agrees that it will not assert or seek to assert
       against any director, officer or employee of the Agent or the Arrangers
       any claim it might have against any of them in respect of the matters
       referred to in Clause 34.7 (Exclusion of Liabilities). Any third party
       referred to in this Clause 34.8 may enjoy the benefit of, or enforce the

       generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with any member
       of the Group whether or not it may or does lead to a conflict with the
       interests of any of the Banks. Similarly, the Agent or the Arrangers may
       undertake business with or for others even though it may lead to a
       conflict with the interests of any of the Banks.

       The Agent may resign its appointment hereunder at any time without
       assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than thirty days' prior
       notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto, PROVIDED THAT
       no such resignation shall be effective until a successor for the Agent is
       appointed in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this Clause 34.

34.11  REMOVAL OF AGENT

       An Instructing Group may, after consultation with the Relevant Obligor,
       remove the Agent from its role as agent under the Finance Documents by

       If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 34.10
       (Resignation) or it is removed pursuant to Clause 34.11 (Removal of

       institution may, with the prior consent of the Relevant Obligor be

       period of such notice but, if no such successor is so appointed, the

34.13  RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

       If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of Clause
       34.12 (Successor Agent), then (a) the retiring or departing Agent shall

       and (b) its successor and each of the other parties hereto shall have the
       same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if
       such successor had been a party hereto.

34.14  OWN RESPONSIBILITY

       It is understood and agreed by each Bank that at all times it has itself
       been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own
       independent appraisal of and investigation into all risks arising under
       or in connection with the Finance Documents including, but not limited
       to:

       34.14.1 the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs,
               status and nature of each member of the Group;

       34.14.2 the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy and

               Documents;

       34.14.3 whether such Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of that
               recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any of their
               respective assets under or in connection with the Finance
               Documents, the transactions therein contemplated or any other
               agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed
               in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the Finance
               Documents; and


                                      165
<PAGE>

       34.14.4 the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information
               Memorandum and any other information provided by the Agent or the

               any other person in connection with the Finance Documents, the
               transactions contemplated therein or any other agreement,
               arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
               anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the Finance
               Documents.

       Accordingly, each Bank acknowledges to the Agent and the Arrangers that

       Arrangers or any of them in respect of any of these matters.

34.15  BANKS' MANDATORY COST DETAILS

       Each Bank will supply the Agent with such information and in such detail
       as the Agent may require in order to calculate the Mandatory Cost Rate in

34.16  RECEIPT OF INFORMATION BY THE AGENT

       Any information or document received by the Agent shall only be treated
       as having been received by the Agent if the same has been delivered to

       Accordingly, any information or documents received by the Agent other
       than by its agency department in accordance with Clause 41 (Notices) is
       not by reason of that receipt to be treated as having been received by
       the Agent unless and until the Agent's agency department has received
       actual notice of the same in accordance with such Clause. Save as
       expressly set out in this Agreement and, unless the Agent's agency
       department shall have received information or documents in accordance
       with Clause 41 (Notices) the Agent shall have no duty to disclose, and
       shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information or
       documents, that are communicated to or obtained by the Agent.

35.2   NO ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS BY NTL

       Neither the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC nor any Obligor shall be
       entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and

       to the terms of this Agreement PROVIDED THAT the Pre-Novation Borrower

<PAGE>

       35.3.2  The prior written consent of the Relevant Obligor (which shall be
               deemed to be given on its own behalf and on behalf of the other
               Obligors) is required for an assignment or transfer by a Bank
               unless the assignment or transfer is to:

               (a)  another Bank; or

               (b)  any subsidiary or holding company (or to any subsidiary of
                    any holding company) of the transferring Bank.

       35.3.3  The Relevant Obligor's consent must not be (a) unreasonably
               delayed or withheld or (b) withheld solely because the assignment
               or transfer may result in an increase to the Mandatory Cost Rate.

35.4   ASSIGNMENTS BY BANKS

       If any Bank assigns all or any of its rights and benefits under the
       Finance Documents in accordance with Clause 35.3 (Assignments and

       notice to the Agent confirming in favour of the Agent, the Arrangers and
       the other Banks that it shall be under the same obligations towards each
       of them as it would have been under if it had been an original party
       hereto as a Bank (whereupon such assignee shall become a party hereto as
       a "BANK"), the Agent, the Arrangers and the other Banks shall not be
       obliged to recognise such assignee as having the rights against each of
       them which it would have had if it had been such a party hereto.

35.5   TRANSFERS BY BANKS

       If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and/or
       obligations under the Finance Documents as contemplated in Clause 35.3
       (Assignments and Transfers by Banks), then such transfer may be effected
       by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed Transfer Certificate
       executed by such Bank and the relevant Transferee in which event, on the
       later of the Transfer Date specified in such Transfer Certificate and the
       fifth Business Day after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by the
       Agent on such Transfer Certificate falling on or after) the date of
       delivery of such Transfer Certificate to the Agent:

       35.5.1  to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Bank party
               thereto seeks to transfer by novation its rights, benefits and
               obligations under the Finance Documents, the Parent, the CWC
               Parent, NTL CC and each of the Obligors and such Bank shall be
               released from further obligations towards one another under the
               Finance Documents and their respective rights against one another
               shall be cancelled (such rights and obligations being referred to
               in this Clause 35.5 as "DISCHARGED RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS");

       35.5.2  the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC and each of the Obligors and
               the Transferee party thereto shall assume obligations towards one
               another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ
               from such discharged rights and obligations only insofar as the
               Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC, the Obligors and such Transferee
               have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of the Parent, the
               CWC Parent, NTL CC the Obligors and such Bank;

                                      167
<PAGE>
       35.5.3  the Agent, the Arrangers, such Transferee and the other Banks
               shall acquire the same rights and benefits and assume the same
               obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and
               assumed had such Transferee been an original party hereto as a
               Bank with the rights, benefits and/or obligations acquired or
               assumed by it as a result of such transfer and to that extent the
               Agent, the Arrangers and the relevant Bank shall each be released
               from further obligations to each other under the Finance
               Documents; and

       35.5.4  such Transferee shall become a party hereto as a "BANK".

35.6   NO INCREASED OBLIGATIONS

       If:

       35.6.1  a Bank assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations
               under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and

       35.6.2  as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the
               assignment, transfer or change of Facility Office, an Obligor
               would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee, Transferee or
               the Bank acting through its new Facility Office under Clause 15.1
               (Tax Gross-up), Clause 15.2 (Tax Indemnity) or Clause 17
               (Increased Costs),

       then the assignee, Transferee or the Bank acting through its new Facility
       Office shall only be entitled to receive payment under those Clauses to
       the same extent as the assignor, transferor or the Bank acting through
       its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer
       or change had not occurred.

35.7   ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER FEES

       On the date upon which an assignment takes effect pursuant to Clause 35.4
       (Assignments by Banks) or a transfer takes effect pursuant to Clause 35.5

               benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents;

       35.8.2  with (or through) whom such Bank enters into (or may potentially
               enter into) any sub-participation in relation to, or any other
               transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to,
               the Finance Documents or any Obligor;

       35.8.3  to whom information may be required to be disclosed by any
               applicable law; or

       35.8.4  any of its subsidiaries or any holding company (or any subsidiary

                                      168
<PAGE>


       such information about the Parent, the CWC Parent, NTL CC, any Obligor or
       the Group and the Finance Documents as such Bank shall consider

       the person to whom such information is to be given has entered into a
       Confidentiality Undertaking. Any Bank which discloses any such
       information to any of the persons referred to in sub-clause 35.8.4 shall

       Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., in such proportions as Morgan Stanley Dean
       Witter Bank Limited notifies to the Agent from time to time and Morgan

       43.7.2  otherwise amend or waive any of the Agent's rights hereunder or
               subject the Agent or the Arrangers to any additional obligations
               hereunder.


44.    GOVERNING LAW

       This Agreement is governed by English law.

45.    JURISDICTION

45.1   ENGLISH COURTS

       The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute
       (a "DISPUTE") arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
       (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity or termination of
       this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity).

45.2   CONVENIENT FORUM

       The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate and
       convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and, accordingly, that
       they will not argue to the contrary.

45.3   NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION

       This Clause 45 is for the benefit of the Finance Parties only. As a
       result and notwithstanding Clause 45.1 (English Courts), it does not
       prevent any Finance Party from taking proceedings relating to a Dispute
       ("PROCEEDINGS") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the extent
       allowed by law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent Proceedings in
       any number of jurisdictions.

45.4   SERVICE OF PROCESS

       NTL CC agrees that the documents which start any Proceedings and any
       other documents required to be served in relation to those Proceedings
       may be served on it by service of such documents on NTL Group Limited at
       NTL House, Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook, Hampshire RG27 9UP (marked
       for the attention of Robert Mackenzie) or, if different, its registered
       office.

       If NTL Group Limited ceases to have a place of business in Great Britain
       or, as the case may be, its appointment ceases to be effective, NTL CC
       shall immediately appoint another person in England to accept service of
       process on its behalf in England. If NTL CC fails to do so (and such
       failure continues for a period of not less than fourteen days), the Agent
       shall be entitled to appoint such a person by notice to NTL CC. Nothing
       contained herein shall restrict the right to serve process in any other
       manner allowed by law. This Clause 45.4 applies to Proceedings in England
       and to Proceedings elsewhere.

                                   SCHEDULE 12
                                 MANDATORY COSTS

1.     The Mandatory Cost Rate is an addition to the interest rate to compensate
       Banks for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of
       England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any
       other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the
       requirements of the European Central Bank.

2.     On the first day of each Term or Interest Period (or as soon as possible
       thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the
       "ADDITIONAL COSTS RATE") for each Bank, in accordance with the formula
       set out below. The Mandatory Cost Rate applicable to the relevant Advance
       will be calculated by the Agent as a weighted average of that Bank's
       additional costs rate rounded to five decimal places (weighted in
       proportion to the percentage participation of each Bank in the relevant
       Advance) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.

3.     The additional costs rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office in
       a Participating Member State will be notified by that Bank to the Agent
       as the cost of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the
       European Central Bank.

4.     The additional cost rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office in
       the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:

               AB+C(B-D)+E x 0.01/100-(A+C) per cent. per annum.

       Where:

       A       is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be
               in excess of any stated minimum) which that Bank is from time to
               time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit
               with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.

       B       is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Revolving
               Margin or, as the case may be, the Term Margin and the Mandatory
               Cost Rate) payable for the relevant Term on the Revolving Loan
               or, as the case may be, the relevant Interest Period on the Term
               Loan.

       C       is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that
               Bank is required from time to time to maintain as interest
               bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.

       D       is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England
               to the Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.

       E       is the rate of charge payable by that Bank to the Financial
               Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Regulations (but, for
               this purpose, ignoring any minimum fee required pursuant to the
               Fees Regulations) and expressed in pounds per Pound
               Sterling1,000,000 of the Fee Base of that Bank.


                                      218
<PAGE>


5.     For the purposes of this Schedule:

       (a)     "ELIGIBLE LIABILITIES" and "SPECIAL DEPOSITS" have the meanings
               given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of
               England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of
               England;

       (b)     "FEES REGULATIONS" means the Banking Supervision (Fees)
               Regulations 1999 or such other law or regulation as may be in
               force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for
               banking supervision; and

       (c)     "FEE BASE" has the meaning given to it, and will be calculated in
               accordance with, the Fees Regulations.

6.     In application of the above formula, A, B, C and D will be included in
       the formula as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in the
       formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting
       D from B shall be taken as zero.

7.     Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Agent for the
       purpose of calculating its additional costs rate. In particular, but
       without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information in
       writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank:

       (a)     its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of its
               Facility Office; and

       (b)     such other information that the Agent may reasonably require for
               such purpose.

       Each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any change to the
       information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

8.     The percentages or rates of charge of each Bank for the purpose of A, C
       and E above shall be determined by the Agent based upon the information
       supplied to it pursuant to paragraph 7 above and on the assumption that
       unless a Bank notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Bank's obligations
       in relation to cash ratio deposits, Special Deposits and the Fee
       Regulations are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction
       of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its
       Facility Office.

       The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination
       results in an additional costs rate which over or under compensates any
       Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any
       Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 7 above is true and correct in all
       respects.

9.     The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received pursuant to
       the Mandatory Cost Rate to the relevant Banks on the basis of the
       additional cost rate incurred by each Bank, as calculated in accordance
       with the above formula and based on the information provided by each Bank
       pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 7 above.

10.    Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a
       formula, the Mandatory Cost Rate, an additional costs rate or any amount
       payable to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive
       and binding on all of the parties hereto.


                                      219
<PAGE>


11.    The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Parent (on
       behalf of the Borrowers) and the Banks, determine and notify to all
       parties any amendments or variations which are required to be made to
       this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or
       any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the
       Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in either
       case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and
       any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
       conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.
