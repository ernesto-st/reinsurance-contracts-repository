(iv) The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, designate as additional Swingline Lenders one or more Revolving Facility Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below.  The acceptance by a Revolving Facility Lender of an appointment as a Swingline Lender hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated Swingline Lender, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Revolving Facility Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement and (ii) references herein to the term &#8220;Swingline Lender&#8221; shall be deemed to include such Revolving Facility Lender in its capacity as a lender of Swingline Loans hereunder.

Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Facility Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment of the applicable Class shall pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars its Revolving Facility Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Facility Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Facility Lenders.

Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by electronic means) of any such demand for payment under a Letter of Credit and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided, that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Facility Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. (h) Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans of the applicable Class; provided, that, if such L/C Disbursement is not reimbursed by the Borrower when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.

An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12.  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term &#8220;Issuing Bank&#8221; shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  Any Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving 30 days&#8217; prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower.  After the resignation of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or to extend, reinstate, or increase any existing Letter of Credit.

The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of (i) for so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent and (ii) at any other time, the Borrower, in each case, in Permitted Investments and at the risk and expense of the Borrower, such deposits shall not bear interest.

(k) Cash Collateralization Following Termination of the Revolving Facility .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of the prepayment in full of all outstanding Revolving Facility Loans and the termination of all Revolving Facility Commitments (a &#8220;Revolving Facility Termination Event&#8221;) in connection with which the Borrower notifies any one or more Issuing Banks that it intends to maintain one or more Letters of Credit initially issued under this Agreement in effect after the date of such Revolving Facility Termination Event (each, a &#8220;Continuing Letter of Credit&#8221;), then the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral under the Security Documents may be terminated in accordance with Section 9.18 if each such Continuing Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized in an amount equal to the Minimum L/C Collateral Amount, which shall be deposited with or at the direction of each such Issuing Bank. (l) Additional Issuing Banks.  From time to time, the Borrower may by notice to the Administrative Agent designate any Lender (in addition to the initial Issuing Banks) each of which agrees (in its sole discretion) to act in such capacity and is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as an Issuing Bank.  Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement (which counterpart shall set forth the Specified Letter of Credit Sublimit of such Issuing Bank) upon the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes. Upon the designation of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the Specified Letter of Credit Sublimit of the other Issuing Banks shall be reduced by the Specified Letter of Credit Sublimit of such additional Issuing Bank on a pro rata basis.

Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall (i) provide to the Administrative Agent copies of any notice received from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(b) no later than the next Business Day after receipt thereof and (ii) report in writing to the Administrative Agent (A) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, 92 Doc#: US1:15347125v11 </FONT></DIV>

Section 2.06 Funding of Borrowings .  (a)   Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided, that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04(a).  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account or accounts designated by the Borrower as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided, that ABR Revolving Loans and Swingline Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of a L/C Disbursement and reimbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with clause (a) of this Section 2.06 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans at such time.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. (c) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may from its own funds make a Revolving Facility Loan on behalf of the Lenders (including by means of Swingline Loans to the Borrower).  In such event, the applicable Lenders on behalf of whom the Administrative Agent made the Revolving Facility Loan shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for all or any portion of such Revolving Facility Loan made on its behalf upon written notice given to each applicable Lender not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day such reimbursement is requested.

If less than all the outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing shall be converted or continued, then each resulting Borrowing shall be in an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum and satisfy the limitations specified in Sections 2.02(c) regarding the maximum number of Borrowings of the relevant Type. (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender&#8217;s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 94 Doc#: US1:15347125v11 </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.01, in the event that the Borrower fails (or, but for the operation of this Section 7.03, would fail) to comply with the requirements of the Financial Covenant, from the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter until the expiration of the 10th Business Day subsequent to the date any Compliance Certificate is required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(c) (the &#8220;Cure Expiration Date&#8221;; and such ten (10) Business Day period, the &#8220;Cure Period&#8221;), the Borrower and Holdings shall have the right to issue Permitted Cure Securities for cash or otherwise receive cash contributions to the capital of such entities, and in each case, to contribute any such cash to the capital of the Borrower (collectively, the &#8220;Cure Right&#8221;), and upon the receipt by the Borrower of such cash (the &#8220;Cure Amount&#8221;), pursuant to the exercise of the Cure Right, the Financial Covenant shall be recalculated giving effect to a pro forma adjustment by which EBITDA shall be increased with respect to such applicable quarter and any four-quarter period that contains such quarter, solely for the purpose of measuring the Financial Covenant and not for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure Amount; provided, that (i) in each four consecutive fiscal quarter period there shall be at least two fiscal quarters in which a Cure Right is not exercised, (ii) a Cure Right shall not be exercised more than five times during the term of the Revolving Facility, (iii) for purposes of this Section 7.03, the Cure Amount shall be no greater than (or shall not be given effect in excess of) the amount required for purposes of complying with the Financial Covenant and (iv) there shall be no pro forma reduction in Indebtedness with the proceeds of the exercise of the Cure Right for determining compliance with the Financial Covenant for the fiscal quarter in respect of which such Cure Right is exercised (either directly through prepayment or indirectly as a result of the netting of Unrestricted Cash).

In this connection, the Collateral Agent (and any Subagents appointed by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights or remedies thereunder at the direction of the Collateral Agent) shall be entitled to the benefits of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, Section 8.07) as though the Collateral Agent (and any such Subagents) were an &#8220;Agent&#8221; under the Loan Documents, as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. Each Secured Party hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent (whether or not by or through employees or agents): (i) to exercise such rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to or conferred upon the Collateral Agent under the Security Documents, together with such powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (ii) to take such action on its behalf as may from time to time be authorized under or in accordance with the Security Documents. Section 8.02 Delegation of Duties .  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may execute any of their respective duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof)) by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.

Should any instrument in writing from the Borrower or any other Loan Party be required by any Subagent so appointed by an Agent to more fully or certainly vest in and confirm to such Subagent such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by such Agent.  If any Subagent, or successor thereto, shall become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Subagent, to the extent permitted by law, shall automatically vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent until the appointment of a new Subagent.

In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to any Credit Event, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or any Issuing Bank, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless such Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to such Credit Event.  Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  Each Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent.  Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, the Majority Class Lenders or all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (a) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guarantee, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security Documents may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent, and (b) in the event of a foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may be, to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, applicable law, the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, applicable law, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other Disposition. Section 8.13 Withholding Tax .  To the extent required by any applicable Requirement of Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the IRS or any authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by any applicable Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any applicable Loan Party to do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including penalties, fines, additions to Tax and interest, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket expenses.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.13.
