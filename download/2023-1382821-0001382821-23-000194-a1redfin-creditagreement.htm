Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (h), in no event  will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this  subsection (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax  position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise  to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or  additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed  to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its  Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  (i) Tax Treatment.  The parties hereto intend and agree that Advances shall be treated  as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not governed by the rules set out in Treasury  Regulations Section 1.1275-4.  (j) Survival.  Each party&#8217;s obligations under this Section 3.10 shall survive the  resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of,  a Lender, the termination of the Term Loan Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of  the Obligations.  3.11 Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender (an &#8220;Affected Lender&#8221;) (a) makes demand upon  Borrower for (or if Borrower is otherwise required to pay) amounts pursuant to Section 3.7, 3.9 or 3.10  hereof, (b) is unable to make or maintain Term SOFR Rate Loans as a result of a condition described in  Section 2.2(h) hereof, (c) is a Defaulting Lender, or (d) denies any consent requested by the Administrative  Agent pursuant to Section 16.2(b) hereof that has the support of Required Lenders, Borrower may, within  ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand, notice (or the occurrence of such other event causing Borrower  to be required to pay such compensation or causing Section 2.2(h) hereof to be applicable), or such Lender  becoming a Defaulting Lender or denial of a request by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 16.2(b)  hereof, as the case may be, by notice in writing to the Administrative Agent and such Affected Lender (i)  request the Affected Lender to cooperate with Borrower in obtaining a replacement Lender satisfactory to  Administrative Agent and Borrower (the &#8220;Replacement Lender&#8221;); (ii) request the non-Affected Lenders to  acquire and assume all of the Affected Lender&#8217;s Advances and its Term Loan Commitment Percentages as  provided herein, but none of such Lenders shall be under any obligation to do so; or (iii) propose a  Replacement Lender subject to approval by Administrative Agent in its good faith business judgment.  If  any satisfactory Replacement Lender shall be obtained, and/or if any one or more of the non-Affected  Lenders shall agree to acquire and assume all of the Affected Lender&#8217;s Advances Term Loan Commitment  Percentages then such Affected Lender shall assign, in accordance with Section 16.3 hereof, all of its  Advances, Term Loan Commitment Percentages and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and  the Other Documents to such Replacement Lender or non-Affected Lenders, as the case may be, in  exchange for payment of the principal amount so assigned and all interest and fees accrued on the amount  so assigned, plus all other Obligations then due and payable to the Affected Lender (excluding, for the  avoidance of doubt, any Prepayment Premium).   </FONT></DIV>

Any such sale may be on cash or credit.  Administrative Agent shall be authorized at  any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons  who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Investment Property Collateral for their own  account in compliance with Regulation D of the Securities Act or any other applicable exemption available  under the Securities Act.  Administrative Agent will not be obligated to make any sale if it determines not  to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of the sale may have been given.  Administrative Agent may  adjourn any sale and sell at the time and place to which the sale is adjourned.  If the Investment Property  Collateral is customarily sold on a recognized market or threatens to decline speedily in value,  Administrative Agent may sell such Investment Property Collateral at any time without giving prior notice  to any Loan Party or other Person.  (ii) Each Loan Party recognizes that Administrative Agent may be unable to  effect or cause to be effected a public sale of the Investment Property Collateral by reason of certain  prohibitions contained in the Securities Act, so that Administrative Agent may be compelled to resort to  one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other  things, to acquire the Investment Property Collateral for their own account, for investment and without a  view to the distribution or resale thereof.  Each Loan Party understands that private sales so made may be  at prices and on other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Investment Property Collateral were sold  at public sales, and agrees that Administrative Agent has no obligation to delay or agree to delay the sale  of any of the Investment Property Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of the  securities which are part of the Investment Property Collateral (even if the issuer would agree), to register  such securities for sale under the Securities Act.  Each Loan Party agrees that private sales made under the  foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.  (iii) The net proceeds arising from the disposition of the Investment Property  Collateral after deducting expenses incurred by Administrative Agent will be applied to the Obligations  pursuant to Section 11.5 hereof.

(iv) At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event  of Default (A) Administrative Agent may transfer any or all of the Investment Property Collateral into its  name or that of its nominee and may exercise all voting rights with respect to the Investment Property  Collateral (and, upon giving notice of such transfer to Borrower, all such rights of the Loan Parties shall  cease; provided the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, permit the Loan Parties to continue to  exercise such rights), but no such transfer shall constitute a taking of such Investment Property Collateral  in satisfaction of any or all of the Obligations, and (B) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive,  for application to the Obligations, all cash or stock dividends and distributions, interest and premiums  declared or paid on the Investment Property Collateral (and all rights of the Loan Parties with respect thereto  shall cease).  (d) (i) Without limiting any other provision hereof, it is understood and agreed that if  the Term Loans are accelerated or otherwise become due, in each case, in respect of any Event of Default  including upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency related event (including acceleration of claims  by operation of law) or upon the occurrence of the board of directors (or similar governing body or any  Person having control of any Loan Party (or any committee thereof) or of any directors (or similar governing  body or any Person having Control) of any Loan Party (or any committee thereof) adopting any resolution  or otherwise authorizing any action to approve any bankruptcy or insolvency related event) (each of the  foregoing, a &#8220;Specified Event&#8221;), the Prepayment Premium that would have applied if, at the time the Term  Loans are accelerated or otherwise become due, the Borrower had paid, refinanced, substituted or replaced  any or all of the Term Loans will also be automatically and immediately due and payable and Prepayment  Premium shall constitute part of the Obligations, in view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of  ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of the  Term Loan Lenders&#8217; damages as a result thereof.  Any Prepayment Premium payable hereunder shall be  presumed to be the liquidated damages sustained by the Term Loan Lenders as the result of such Specified  Event and the Borrower and the other Loan Parties agree that the Prepayment Premium is reasonable under  the circumstances currently existing.  The Prepayment Premium that would have applied if, at the time the  Term Loans are satisfied or released by foreclosure, (whether by power of judicial proceeding), deed in lieu  of foreclosure or by any other similar means, the Borrower had paid, refinanced, substituted or replaced  any or all of the Term Loans shall also be payable in the event the Obligations (and/or this Agreement) are  satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure  or by any other similar means.  (ii) THE BORROWER AND EACH OTHER LOAN PARTY EXPRESSLY WAIVES  (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT  OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF  THE PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH SPECIFIED EVENT.  (iii) The Borrower and each other Loan Party expressly agrees (to the fullest extent that it  may lawfully do so) that: (A) the Prepayment Premium is reasonable and is the product of an arm&#8217;s length  transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel; (B) the Prepayment  Premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time payment is made;  (C) there has been a course of conduct between the (I) Initial Term Loan Lenders and the Borrower and the  other Loan Parties and (II) the Delayed Draw Term Loan Lenders and the Borrower and the other Loan  Parties, in each case giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the  Prepayment Premium; and (D) the Borrower and each other Loan Party shall each be estopped hereafter  from claiming differently than as agreed to in this paragraph.  </FONT></DIV>

Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except  those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Other Documents.  Neither Administrative Agent nor  any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be (i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them  as such hereunder or in connection herewith, unless caused by their gross (not mere) negligence or willful  misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment), or (ii)  responsible in any manner for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan  Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement, or in any of the Other Documents or in any  certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Administrative  Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents or for the value, validity,  effectiveness, genuineness, due execution, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the  Other Documents or for any failure of any Loan Party to perform its obligations hereunder.  Administrative  Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or  performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any of the Other  Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.  The duties of Administrative  as respects the Advances to Loan Parties shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; neither the  Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in  respect of any Lender, any Loan Party or any other Person; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or  implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations  in respect of this Agreement or the transactions described herein except as expressly set forth herein.  14.3 Lack of Reliance on Administrative Agent and Arranger.    (a) Independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent, the Arranger or  any other Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation  of the financial condition and affairs of each Loan Party in connection with the making and the continuance  of the Advances hereunder and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith, and (ii) its  own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Loan Party.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor the  Arranger shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any  Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before  making of the Advances or at any time or times thereafter except as shall be provided by any Loan Party  pursuant to the terms hereof.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall be responsible to  any Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any  agreement, document, certificate or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution,  effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any  Other Document, or of the financial condition of any Loan Party, or be required to make any inquiry  concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this  Agreement, the Notes, the Other Documents or the financial condition or prospects of any Loan Party, or  the existence of any Event of Default or any Default.  (b) The Administrative Agent, the Arranger and each of their respective Affiliates  hereby informs the Lenders that each such Person is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice,  or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that  such Person has a financial interest in the transactions contemplated hereby in that such Person or an  Affiliate thereof (i) may receive interest or other payments with respect to the Loans, the Term Loan  Commitments and this Agreement, (ii) may recognize a gain if it extended the Loans or the Term Loan  </FONT></DIV>

Administrative Agent may resign on thirty (30) days written notice to each Lender and Borrower.  If  Administrative Agent is not a Lender, Administrative Agent may be removed in a writing delivered to  Borrower and Administrative Agent and signed by Required Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or  removal, Required Lenders will promptly designate a successor Administrative Agent reasonably  satisfactory to Loan Parties; provided, that no notice to or approval of Loan Parties shall be required (i) in  any case where the successor Administrative Agent is one of the Lenders or (ii) after the occurrence and  during the continuance of any Event of Default.  Any such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed  to the rights, powers and duties of Administrative Agent and shall in particular succeed to all of  Administrative Agent&#8217;s right, title and interest in and to all of the Liens in the Collateral securing the  Obligations created hereunder or any Other Document, and the term &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221; shall mean  such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Administrative Agent&#8217;s rights, powers  and duties as Administrative Agent, shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part  of such former Administrative Agent.  However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of the  effectiveness of the new applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s appointment, any further actions need to be  taken in order to provide for the legally binding and valid transfer of any Liens in the Collateral from former  applicable Administrative Agent to new applicable Administrative Agent and/or for the perfection of any  Liens in the Collateral as held by new applicable Administrative Agent or it is otherwise not then possible  for new applicable Administrative Agent to become the holder of a fully valid, enforceable and perfected  Lien as to any of the Collateral, former applicable Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such Liens  solely as agent for perfection of such Liens on behalf of new applicable Administrative Agent until such  time as new applicable Administrative Agent can obtain a fully valid, enforceable and perfected Lien on all  Collateral, provided, that Administrative Agent shall not be required to or have any liability or responsibility  to take any further actions after such date for perfection to continue of any such Liens (other than to forego  from taking any affirmative action to release any such Liens).  After Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation  (or removal) as Administrative Agent the provisions of this Article XIV, and any indemnification rights  under this Agreement, including without limitation, rights arising under Section 16.5 hereof, shall inure to  its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this  Agreement (and in the event resigning (or removed) Administrative Agent continues to hold any Liens  pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, the provisions of this Article XIV and  any indemnification rights under this Agreement, including without limitation, rights arising under Section  16.5 hereof, shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it in connection with  such Liens).  14.5 Certain Rights of Administrative Agent.  If Administrative Agent shall request instructions  from Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement  or any Other Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such  action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from Required Lenders;  and Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.  Without limiting  the foregoing, Lenders shall not have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a  result of its acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of Required  Lenders.  </FONT></DIV>

Each Loan Party hereby grants to any  Participant a continuing security interest in any deposits, moneys or other property actually or  constructively held by such Participant as security for the Participant&#8217;s interest in the Advances.

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and  not merely as a surety, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor when and as due, whether at maturity,  by acceleration, by notice of prepayment or otherwise, the due and punctual performance of all Obligations;  provided, that with respect to Obligations under or in respect of any Swap Obligation, the foregoing  guarantee shall only be effective to the extent that such Guarantor is a Qualified ECP Loan Party at the time  such Swap Obligation is entered into and such Obligations and such guarantee thereof are not Excluded  Hedge Liabilities.  Each payment made by any Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty shall be made in lawful  money of the United States in immediately available funds.  17.2 Waivers.  Each Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i)  promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, notice of presentment of payment and any other notice  hereunder, (ii) demand of payment, protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment, notice of the present and  future amount of the Obligations and any other notice with respect to the Obligations, (iii) any requirement  that Administrative Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or Lien on  any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any other Loan Party, or any  Person or any Collateral, (iv) any other action, event or precondition to the enforcement hereof or the  performance by each such Guarantor of the Obligations, and (v) any defense arising by any lack of capacity  or authority or any other defense of any Loan Party or any notice, demand or defense by reason of cessation  from any cause of Obligations other than payment and performance in full of the Obligations by the Loan  Parties and any defense that any other guarantee or security was or was to be obtained by Administrative  Agent.  17.3 No Defense.

PRIORITY DATE /  FILING DATE / ISSUE  DATE  ASSIGNEE(S)  REPRESENTATIVE  ISSUED CLAIM  CLAIM SUMMARY  32806- 115339  CONSOLIDATING LEADS  RECEIVED FROM  POTENTIAL RENTERS FOR  BILLING A LISTER  8,112,329  December 30, 2008  December 30, 2008  February 7, 2012  Rent Group Inc.        Claim 1    This patent relates to billing a lister associated with a property listing.  In  particular, the lister is billed based on a number of distinct leads received for the  property listing, and a distinct lead includes two or more leads from the same  potential renter (e.g., the same renter expressed interest in the property listing at  least twice).     32806- 115338  CONSOLIDATING LEADS  INTO A LEAD GROUP  8,626,612  December 30, 2008  January 19, 2012  January 7, 2014  Rent Group Inc.      Claim 1    This patent relates to representing multiple leads received from user devices as  lead groups.  The multiple leads are added to a lead group and forwarded to the  lister as one consolidated lead if the leads originated from a single user.        32806- 115337  METHOD AND  APPARATUS FOR  APARTMENT LISTINGS  10,643,263  February 13, 2013  February 12, 2014  May 5, 2020  Rent Group Inc.          Claim 1    This patent relates to a property listing search GUI and furthermore generating  alerts corresponding to listings within a map region displayed on the GUI.  The  map region displayed on the GUI shows icons with number indicators  representative of a total number of physical buildings corresponding to each  respective icon.  A listings pane is displayed adjacent to the map region and  includes associated listing information.  Zooming in or out on the map region  adjusts the icons and corresponding number indicators based on the new total  number of listings in the zoomed in or out map region.    32806- 115334  SYSTEM TO CAPTURE  COMMUNICATION  INFORMATION  8,908,846  June 22, 2005  June 22, 2005  December 9, 2014  Rent Group Inc.          Claim 1    This patent relates to processing information from telephone conversations held  between property listers and users (potential purchasers), where an online listing  system coordinates the telephone conversations with proxy telephone numbers.   Upon completion of the telephone conversations, the online listing system scans  the call information to determine whether a contract associated with a property  listing was formed between the listers and users.
