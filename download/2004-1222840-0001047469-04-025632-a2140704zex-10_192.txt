that Seller will not attempt to remove or cannot remove disapproved matters, if
Seller does not agree to remove such disapproved matters, to either terminate
this Agreement or agree to accept title to the Project subject to the
disapproved matters that Seller cannot, or will not, remove. If Buyer does not
notify Seller in writing within such seven (7) day period of Buyer's willingness
to accept title to the Project subject to those matters Seller cannot, or will
not, remove, Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement
and the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to Buyer.

The exceptions to title that Buyer approves, or is deemed to have approved,
under this SECTION 4.1.1, and under the terms of SECTION 4.1.2 below, and any
liens or encumbrances created by Buyer, and any Leases entered into in
accordance with SECTION 5.1.1, shall be referred to as "Permitted Title
Exceptions"; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of this
SECTION 4.1.1, or SECTION 4.1.2 below but except as permitted in SECTION 5.1.6
below, the Permitted Title Exceptions shall not include, and Seller shall remove
at or before the Closing and shall cause the Project to be delivered free and
clear of, any lien encumbering the Project that secures the payment of money,
such as mechanic's and materialmen's liens, and the liens of deeds of trust and
mortgages unless Buyer otherwise notifies Seller in writing or unless such liens
or encumbrances were created by Buyer.

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller is in the process of: (i) preparing
and recording an "Amended Binding Site Plan" for the reconfiguration of the
Legal Lots at the Land, a copy of which has been delivered to Buyer, (ii)
amending the ORREA and the COREA with respect to construction of certain
improvements at the Project and the "Neighborhood Center," and (iii) dedicating
as a public street 59th Avenue to the City of Lakewood. Buyer shall have the
right to approve the documents referenced in the immediately preceding clauses
(i) through (iii) in connection with Buyer's title review, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller shall have the
right to complete the foregoing notwithstanding any disapproval by Buyer and in
such event Buyer's sole remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement because of a
failure of this Buyer's Condition. Buyer acknowledges receipt of draft copies of
such documents.

                  4.1.2     SURVEY APPROVAL AND RECERTIFICATION. If Buyer
elects, Buyer shall have obtained, at Buyer's expense, an updated ALTA survey of
the Land and Improvements (the "Buyer's Survey") and Buyer shall have reviewed
and approved those matters disclosed by the Buyer's Survey, if any, and the
Existing Survey no later than the Title Comment Date. If Buyer fails, within
such period, to disapprove any matter disclosed in the Buyer's Survey, if any,
and the Existing Survey, by written notice to Seller, then the Buyer's Survey,
if any, and the Existing Survey shall be deemed approved by Buyer. Otherwise,
the process for removing and approving the matters disclosed in the Existing
Survey shall be the same as applied to the Title Commitment, as set forth in
SECTION 4.1.1 above.

                  4.1.3     INSPECTION APPROVAL. Buyer shall have approved in
writing, in Buyer's sole and absolute discretion, at or before the End of the
Inspection Period, the condition of the Project following Buyer's inspection of
the Project. With respect to Buyer's investigation, Buyer may, by means of
agents and experts acceptable to Buyer, inspect and receive reports concerning
the condition of the Project, including, but not limited to, the condition of
the roofs, the utilities and the mechanical systems, the structure of the
Improvements, the absence of material deferred maintenance relating thereto, and
the soil and environmental condition of the Project. Buyer's failure to notify
Seller of Buyer's approval of the physical condition of the Project at or prior
to the End of the Inspection Period shall be deemed an approval of the Project's
physical condition by Buyer.

                  4.1.4     DUE DILIGENCE APPROVAL. Buyer shall have approved,
in Buyer's sole discretion, at or prior to the End of the Inspection Period, all
matters disclosed by the Building Documents and other matters discovered by
Buyer in the course of Buyer's investigation of the Project. If Buyer fails, at
or prior to the End of the Inspection Period, to approve any such matters, by
written notice to Seller, then all such matters shall be deemed approved by
Buyer and this Buyer's Condition shall be deemed satisfied. See also SECTION
5.1.1 hereof.

                  4.1.5     TENANT ESTOPPELS. At least two (2) business days
prior to the scheduled date of the Closing, Buyer shall have received Tenant
Estoppels (Seller's Estoppel Certificates do not satisfy this requirement) in
form and substance satisfactory

                                      -11-
<Page>

to Buyer from (a) all of the Lead Tenants and all other Tenants for which
memoranda of lease have been recorded in the Auditor's Records of Pierce County,
Washington, and (b) other Tenants which, together with such Tenants under clause
(a), lease an aggregate of eighty-five percent (85%) of the GLA of the Project
which is leased as of May 10, 2004. The Tenant Estoppels may be dated any date
after May 10, 2004 and shall be substantially (i) in the form of EXHIBIT "I"
attached hereto for Tenants under Leases which do not limit the information to
be provided in the form of tenant estoppel such Tenants are required to execute
and deliver, or (ii) in the form referenced in the applicable Leases with
respect to Leases specifying the form of the estoppel certificates, or (iii)
such other form as Buyer may reasonably approve. Buyer shall not be required to
approve any estoppel certificate which contains any statement that is materially
inconsistent with the terms of the Basic Rent Roll or applicable Lease, or that
alleges any material default on the part of the landlord under the applicable
Lease, or that asserts any right to offset or withhold rent due under the
applicable Lease except as expressly permitted by the terms of the Lease.
Seller shall provide a Seller Estoppel Certificate to Buyer in the form attached
hereto as EXHIBIT "I-1" for the balance of the leased GLA of the Project two (2)
business days prior to the scheduled date of the Closing. If any Tenant for
which Seller delivers a Seller Estoppel Certificate thereafter delivers a Tenant
Estoppel to Buyer prior to the Closing satisfying the requirements of the second
preceding sentence, then Buyer shall return to Seller the respective Seller
Estoppel Certificate and such Seller Estoppel Certificate shall be of no force
or effect whatsoever and if such requirements are not satisfied then this
Buyer's Condition shall be deemed not satisfied and the provisions of SECTION
4.2 shall apply. Seller shall use Seller's commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a Tenant Estoppel from each and every Tenant; provided however, that
Seller shall not be in default hereunder if despite Seller's commercially
reasonable efforts, Seller is unable to deliver a Tenant Estoppel from every
Tenant required hereunder but Seller has delivered a Seller's Estoppel
Certificate to the extent required hereunder.

                  4.1.6     SELLER'S DELIVERIES. Seller shall have delivered to
Buyer, at or before the Closing, all items to be delivered by Seller as
described in SECTION 6.3.

                  4.1.7     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Seller's

have delivered a certificate to Buyer, dated as of the date of the Closing, in
the form of EXHIBIT "L" attached hereto, certifying that the Seller's
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of the certificate.

                  4.1.8     SELLER'S AUTHORIZATION. At or prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall have received evidence satisfactory to Buyer and Buyer's counsel
that Seller has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
execute and deliver all of the other agreements and documents required to be
executed and delivered as provided herein, and to sell the Project to Buyer in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, and that the persons and
parties executing this Agreement and such other agreements and documents to be
delivered to Buyer on behalf of Seller have been duly authorized to do so. Such
evidence shall include a good standing certificate issued by the Secretary of
State of the State of Washington.

                  4.1.9     TITLE POLICY. At the Closing, the Title Insurer and
Chicago Title shall be irrevocably committed to issue the Title Policy.

                  4.1.10    NO MATERIAL CHANGE. There shall have been: (i) no
material loss or damage to the physical condition of the Project or other
circumstances allowing Buyer to terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
11.1 hereof; (ii) no material adverse change in the leasing and occupancy level
of the Project from that level existing on the Effective Date, which for
purposes of this provision shall mean a reduction in the amount of GLA leased by
any Tenants in excess of five thousand (5,000) square feet of GLA; (iii) no
material default or event which with the giving of

                                      -12-
<Page>

notice or the passage of time or both would be a default, by any Tenant(s)
leasing in excess of five thousand (5,000) square feet of GLA in the aggregate,
(iv) no filing for protection under the United States Bankruptcy Act by any Lead
Tenant, and (v) no material adverse charge in the income or expenses of the
Project after the Effective Date. If there is an adverse change under clause
(ii) or (iii) above, involving less than five thousand (5,000) square feet of
GLA, Seller and Buyer agree to negotiate in good faith for Seller to make
additional deposits under the Escrow and Leasing Agreement for a period of up to
eighteen (18) months with respect thereto.

                  4.1.11    SELLER'S COVENANTS. Except for immaterial matters,

hereunder required to be performed on or before the Closing Date.

Earnest Money Deposit shall promptly be returned to Buyer.

                  4.1.13    THEATRE LEASE AMENDMENT. Seller and Loews Cineplex
Odeon (the "Theatre Tenant") shall have entered into an amendment to the two (2)

substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT "N," with such changes
thereto as may be reasonably approved by Buyer.

                  4.1.14    RESTRICTIVE USE DECLARATION. The Restrictive Use
Declaration shall have been recorded in the Auditor's Records of Pierce County,
Washington encumbering the Project and the Neighborhood Center to evidence the
applicability of (i) exclusive use provisions in Leases for premises located in
the Project that apply to the Neighborhood and vice versa, and (ii) prohibited
use provisions under Leases in either the Project or the Neighborhood Center
that apply to the other property and are not already included in the COREA or
the ORREA.

                  4.1.15    59TH AVENUE. A deed conveying 59th Avenue, as shown
on the Site Plan, to the City of Lakewood shall have been recorded in the

                  Buyer shall have the right (in Buyer's sole and absolute
discretion) to elect to waive any Buyer's Condition or other condition to the
Closing. In the event any Buyer's Condition is not satisfied, deemed satisfied,
or waived in writing by Buyer prior to the expiration of the applicable period
for satisfaction or waiver (and in the absence of a specified period then at or
before the Closing Date), then the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to
Buyer and this Agreement shall automatically terminate and neither Buyer nor
Seller shall have any further rights hereunder except as otherwise specifically
set forth herein with respect to matters which survive termination of this
Agreement; provided however, if there is a failure of a Buyer Condition set
forth in SECTIONS 4.1.5, 4.1.6, 4.1.7, 4.1.8, 4.1.9, 4.1.11 OR 4.1.13 THROUGH
4.1.16, inclusive, then the time period for satisfaction (or waiver by Buyer in
Buyer's sole discretion) of such

Buyer's Conditions shall, at Buyer's option exercised by written notice to
Seller and Escrow Holder, be extended to June 21, 2004. In the event this
Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all documents and funds delivered by

          4.3     SELLER'S CONDITIONS.

                  Seller's obligation to convey the Project to Buyer, and the
Closing, shall in addition to any other conditions set forth in this Agreement
in favor of Seller, be conditional and contingent upon the satisfaction, or

          4.4     FAILURE OF SELLER CONDITIONS.

waiver as provided above, or in the event Seller fails to notify Buyer and
Escrow Holder in writing that any Seller Condition is not satisfied or waived by
Seller on or prior to the applicable period for satisfaction or waiver as

                                  5. COVENANTS

          5.1     SELLER'S COVENANTS.

                  In addition to all other covenants of Seller contained herein,
Seller makes the following covenants to Buyer:

                  5.1.1     LEASING ACTIVITIES. During the Contract Period,
Seller agrees that Seller shall continue to perform all of Seller's obligations
as landlord under the Leases. Prior to the End of the Inspection Period, Seller
may enter into new Leases, amend, terminate, accept the surrender of, or grant
any consent with respect to any Lease, or approve the assignment of any Lease
without Buyer's consent; subject however, to Seller providing a copy of the
relevant document to Buyer within five (5) business days thereafter and in any
event at least three (3) business days prior to the End of the Inspection
Period. After the End of the Inspection Period, Seller shall not enter into any
new Leases, amend, terminate, accept the surrender of, or grant any consent with
respect to any Lease, or approve the assignment of any Lease, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent may be given or withheld in Buyer's
reasonable discretion; provided however, Seller shall have the right, even if
Buyer refuses to consent, to enter into a Lease amendment with the Theatre
Tenant substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT "N." Seller shall
also have the right to terminate the lease with Sound Community Bank (which
Tenant is currently located in the area to be demolished in connection with the
Theatre Related Improvements), in connection with such Tenant's relocation from
the Project to the "Neighborhood Center" (which is not part of the Project). The
relocation of Sound Community Bank to the Neighborhood Center is currently
expected to occur on or about May 31, 2004. Seller shall promptly after
execution thereof deliver to Buyer an executed letter of intent or term sheet,
if any, for each Lease, amendment, termination, surrender, consent or assignment
for which Buyer's consent is to be requested under this Section. Buyer's failure
to respond to Seller in writing within seven (7) business days after Buyer's
receipt of a written request from Seller seeking Buyer's consent pursuant to
this SECTION 5,1.1 shall be deemed conclusively to constitute Buyer's consent to
the proposed transaction. Any such request by Seller shall contain a copy of the
proposed new Lease, amendment, termination, surrender, consent or assignment
and, in the case of a new Lease or an assignment, relevant information in
Seller's possession or control regarding the proposed Tenant necessary for Buyer
to evaluate the Tenant. Prior to the End of the Inspection Period, Buyer's
approval of new Leases or for lease amendments, extensions or terminations shall
not be required; provided, however, Seller shall deliver copies of all such
Leases or lease amendments, extensions or terminations to Buyer prior to the End
of the Inspection Period and if Buyer disapproves any of such Leases or Lease
amendments, extensions or terminations prior to the End of the Inspection
Period, or if Buyer disapproves the Theatre Lease Amendment and Seller
nevertheless executes such Lease amendment (whether before or after the End of
the Inspection Period), then the Buyer's Condition set forth in SECTION 4.1.4
hereof shall be deemed not satisfied and Buyer may exercise Buyer's rights
under SECTION 4.2 of this Agreement. Seller agrees to deliver drafts of Leases
to Buyer for review during the Lease negotiation process and to keep Buyer
advised of the status of Lease negotiations.

                            Pursuant to the Escrow and Leasing Agreement, Seller
is responsible for payment of all tenant allowances (including construction
costs which are the obligation of the landlord under Leases), leasing
commissions and other leasing costs to be borne by the landlord under the
Leases, if any, executed during the Contract

                                      -15-
<Page>

Period to the extent of funds deposited therefor under the Escrow and Leasing
Agreement.

                  5.1.2     NEW CONTRACTS. During the Contract Period, Seller
agrees that Seller shall not enter into any new Service Contract or any other
contract relating or pertaining to the Project which would extend beyond the
Closing Date, or amend or modify any such contract, in any manner that would
preclude Buyer from terminating the same without cost or expense to Buyer on not
more than thirty (30) days' written notice, given at any time after the Closing,
unless Seller has obtained Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer's failure to respond
to Seller in writing within five (5) business days after Buyer's receipt of a
written request from Seller seeking Buyer's consent pursuant to this SECTION
5.1.2 shall be deemed conclusively to constitute Buyer's consent to the proposed
transaction. Any such request by Seller shall contain a copy of the proposed new
Service Contract.

                  5.1.3     PAYMENT OF OBLIGATIONS. At all times during the
Contract Period, Seller shall timely pay all monetary obligations and perform
Seller's material obligations under the Leases and Service Contracts and shall
timely pay all taxes, assessments, brokerage and leasing commissions, management
fees and utility charges affecting the Project. Seller agrees to deliver to
Buyer copies of any notice of default received by Seller under any Leases or
Service Contracts during the Contract Period.

                  5.1.4     INSURANCE. At all times during the Contract Period,
Seller shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, in full force and effect and
pay, or cause to be paid, all premiums for Seller's "all risk" and liability
insurance policies currently covering the Project.

                  5.1.5     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. During the Contract Period,
Seller shall use Seller's commercially reasonable efforts to remove, or cause to
be removed, any notices of violations of any federal, state or municipal or
other health, building, zoning, safety, environmental protection or other
applicable code, law, ordinance, rule or regulation now or hereafter existing
and relating to the Project and to promptly deliver copies of any such notices
to Buyer.

                  5.1.6     REMOVE LIENS. At or prior to the Closing, Seller
agrees to fully pay, satisfy or otherwise remove, at Seller's sole expense, all
deeds of trust, mortgages or other monetary liens against the Project, all
mechanic's or materialman's liens or any similar claim or lien claimed against
the Project, or any part thereof, arising from work performed or commenced or
materials supplied, prior to the Closing (except for any liens arising from the
activities of Buyer or Buyer's employees, agents or representatives), such that
there are and will be no mechanic's or materialman's liens existing or that may
arise by reason of the construction of the Improvements; provided however,
Seller shall have the right to obtain, and shall obtain at Seller's cost, a
title endorsement to Buyer's Title Policy insuring Buyer against loss with
respect to any such liens referenced in this clause (ii) if Seller is contesting
such liens in good faith and Seller shall not be required to remove liens
arising from leasehold improvements constructed by Tenants, if any, to the
extent such Tenants are responsible for the cost of such construction and
provided that Seller is reasonably enforcing such Tenant's Lease provisions
concerning removal or contest of any such liens and Seller shall not be required
to remove liens arising from activities of Buyer or Buyer's Representatives on
the Project.

                  5.17      TENANT ESTOPPELS. Seller shall use Seller's
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Buyer: (i) the Tenant
Estoppels described in SECTION 4.1.5. and (ii) estoppels in form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer from guarantors of any Tenant's obligations under the
Leases (the "Lease Guarantor Estoppels") as

                                      -16-
<Page>

promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in any event at least two (2)
business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date.

                  5.1.8     OPERATING REPORTS. Within fifteen (15) days after
the end of each calendar month during the Contract Period, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer an operating report with respect to the Project's operations for such
month, which report shall indicate gross rental income, gross income from other
(identified) sources, expenses of each kind and amount, rent delinquencies and
vacancies.

                  5.1.9     MAINTENANCE. During the Contract Period, Seller
shall maintain the Project, including all landscaping, in its present condition,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and Seller shall not otherwise deviate from its
ordinary and customary operation, maintenance or management of the Project.
Seller shall, within three (3) days of its occurrence, provide Buyer with
written notice of any material change in the condition of the Project which is
other than as a result of ordinary wear and tear; the notice shall indicate the
extent of the damage, the anticipated cost of repair and the time necessary to
make such repairs.

                  5.1.10    PERSONAL PROPERTY. Except to the extent such items
are replaced with items having equal or greater value in the ordinary course of
business, Seller shall not dispose of any Personal Property costing in the
aggregate more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) without Buyer's prior
written approval.

                  5.1.11    COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION. Seller agrees at
Seller's sole cost and expense to diligently complete construction, or cause
such construction to be completed, in a good and workerlike manner of all tenant
improvements under Leases executed prior to the Closing Date, and such other
items as are set forth in the Escrow and Leasing Agreement, pursuant to the
plans and specifications therefor. Seller also agrees to cause completion of all
"punch list" items with respect to the "Landlord Work," if any, and other tenant
improvements under Leases executed prior to the Closing Date, within the time
periods required by such Leases, whether or not such date occurs prior to the
Closing Date. Seller shall also assign and deliver to Buyer any and all
construction warranties obtained by Seller in connection with such construction
to the extent such warranties are assignable by Seller and except to the extent
such warranties have been assigned to Tenants. Subject to Seller's receipt of
all required governmental permits and approvals, and approvals of third parties
(including the Loew's Cineplex Theatre Tenant), Seller shall commence and
complete construction of the Theatre Related Improvements within the time period
required by the Theatre Lease Amendment.

                  5.1.12    COOPERATION WITH BUYER'S AUDIT. Seller agrees to
reasonably cooperate with reasonable requests of Buyer's independent accounting
firm (at no cost or expense to Seller) relative to the performance by said
accounting firm of an audit of Seller's books and records with respect to the
rental income and operating expenses for the Project.

          5.2     BUYER'S COVENANTS.

                  In addition to all other covenants of Buyer contained herein,
Buyer makes the following covenants to Seller:

                  5.2.1     TENANT CONTACTS. Buyer agrees to notify Seller prior
to contacting any Tenant and to allow Seller the opportunity to attend any
meeting between any Tenant and Buyer. Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller
with copies of all correspondence and other communications between any Tenant
and Buyer.

                  5.2.2     SELLER'S DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. Buyer, at no
expense to Buyer, agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller's development
activities on other property owned by Seller, including specifically the
Neighborhood Center. Such

                                      -17-
<Page>

cooperation by Buyer shall include Buyer's execution of such amendments to the

days prior to the scheduled Closing

                                      -20-

Date. Seller shall be entitled to all income produced from the operation of the
Project which is allocable to the period prior to Closing and Seller shall be
responsible for all expenses allocable to that period; and Buyer shall be
entitled to all income and, as between Seller and Buyer solely with regard to
Service Contracts or other obligations accepted and expressly assumed by Buyer
at Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for all expenses allocable to the period
beginning at 12:01 A.M. on the day Closing occurs. At the Closing, all items of
income and expense listed below with respect to the Project shall be prorated in
accordance with the foregoing principles and the rules for the specific items
set forth hereafter:

                  6.6.1     ITEMS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE.

                            6.6.1.1    Seller shall arrange for a billing under
all those Service Contracts for which fees are based on usage and with utility
companies for a billing for utilities, to include all utilities or service used
up to the Closing Date, and Seller shall pay the resultant bills. In the event
any of the Service Contracts to be assumed by Buyer cover periods beyond the
Closing Date the same shall be prorated on a per diem basis. In the event that
final meter readings cannot be obtained due to the utility companies' internal
operating procedures, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any payments to such
utilities applicable to the period prior to the Closing Date immediately upon
receipt of evidence of such payments from Buyer.

                            6.6.1.2    Real estate taxes and personal property
taxes on the Project, including without limitation installments of general,
special or betterment assessments on the Project, shall be prorated based upon
the period (I.E., calendar or other tax fiscal year) to which same are
attributable, regardless of whether or not any such taxes are then due and
payable or are a lien. Seller shall pay at or prior to Closing (or Buyer shall
receive credit for) any unpaid taxes attributable to periods prior to the
Closing Date (whether or not then due and payable or a lien as aforesaid).
Seller shall receive credit for any previously paid or prepaid taxes
attributable to periods from and after the Closing Date. In the event that as of
the Closing Date the actual tax bills for the tax year or years in question are
not available and the amount of taxes to be prorated as aforesaid cannot be
ascertained, then rates, millages and assessed valuation of the previous year,
with known changes, shall be used; and after the Closing Date and when the
actual amount of taxes for the year or years in question shall be determinable,
such taxes will be re-prorated between the parties to reflect the actual amount
of such taxes.

                            6.6.1.3    Rentals and other payments (other than
"percentage rent" and common area maintenance charges which are dealt with in
SECTION 6.6.1.4 and SECTION 6.6.1.6) which are payable pursuant to Leases shall
be prorated on a per diem basis as if collected on the date such amounts accrue.
Buyer shall not be obligated to make any payment or give any credit to Seller on
account of or by reason of any rental or other payments which are unpaid as of
the Closing Date, but shall be required merely to turn over Seller's share of
the same within thirty (30) days if, as and when received by Buyer after the
Closing Date (subject to SECTION 6.6.3).

                            6.6.1.4    Percentage rent (I.E., that portion of
the rent payable by a Tenant under a Lease which is a percentage of the amount
of sales or of the dollar amount of sales), if any, payable under each Lease
shall not be prorated with respect to the lease year thereunder in which the
Closing occurs. Any percentage rent collected by Buyer relating to calendar year
2004 or later shall be retained by Buyer.

                            6.6.1.5    Gas, water, electricity, heat, fuel,
sewer and other utilities charges to which SECTION 6.6.6.1 cannot be applied,
and the governmental licenses, permits and inspection fees relating to the
Project, shall be prorated on a per diem basis.

                                      -21-
<Page>

                            6.6.1.6    Common area maintenance expenses and
charges, shall be prorated. Seller shall be responsible for all common area
expenses and charges incurred prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be
responsible for the same, on and subsequent to the Closing Date (but, as between
Seller and Buyer, only to the extent incurred under Service Contracts accepted
and expressly assumed by Buyer at Closing). All common area expense payments
made by each Tenant and such charges paid under its respective Lease for the
entire lease year during which the Closing occurs, including in each case
end-of-year adjustments, if any, shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer in
the following manner: Not later than two (2) days prior to Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer, with regard to each Tenant required to pay common area charges
("CAM Charges") under its respective Lease a detailed computation showing all
estimated CAM Charge expenses incurred by Seller for the period from the
beginning of each such Tenant's then current billing period for CAM Charges
(E.G., calendar year, lease year, etc.) through the Closing Date (which
computation may be based on the estimated amounts therefor set forth in the
Project's budget for calendar year 2004), any CAM monthly estimates or charges
theretofore collected by Seller relating to such Tenant (hereinafter referred to
as the "CAM Estimates"), and a calculation of each Tenant's estimated prorata
share of CAM Charges (I.E., for CAM charges through the Closing Date net of any
such CAM Estimates), together with all invoices and other evidence documenting
such CAM Charges in detail required by such Tenant's Lease to the extent
available at that time. Such calculations prepared by Seller shall be
incorporated into a single post-Closing (as and when appropriate for annual
reconciliation or other billing of CAM charges for any Tenant) reconciliation
for CAM Charges to such Tenant, in which event such applicable amount, as and
when paid, shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer based on the ratio of
pre- and post-Closing CAM expenses (taking into account any CAM Estimates
retained by Seller at Closing).

                                       Any CAM Estimates for any Tenant shall be
retained by Seller up to the amount of the pre-Closing CAM Charges payable by
such Tenant as evidenced by such computations delivered by Seller at Closing,
and any excess shall be paid or credited to Buyer at Closing.

                            6.6.1.7    To the extent not paid by Seller prior to
Closing, all unpaid brokerage and leasing commissions or other compensation due
or accrued prior or subsequent to the Closing Date to any broker, agent, or
other person in connection with the Project for brokerage or other services
rendered to Seller or any predecessor of Seller in connection with the
management and/or leasing of the Project shall remain the responsibility of
Seller.

                            6.6.1.8    All prepaid rentals, and other prepaid
payments under any Leases, license agreements or concession agreements relating
to the Project, shall all belong to Buyer and all shall be assigned and
delivered to Buyer at the Closing.

                            6.6.1.9    Buyer shall not be responsible for any
charges, salaries, vacation pay or fringe benefits of employees of Seller prior
to or following the Closing and none of the foregoing shall be prorated.

                            6.6.1.10   Tax and other escrow deposits (if any)
held by Seller's lender under any loan secured by a mortgage on the Project
shall be retained by Seller.

                  6.6.2     All prorations and payments to be made under the
foregoing provisions shall be made on the basis of a written statement or
statements delivered to Buyer by Seller and approved by Buyer. In the event any
prorations, apportionments or computation shall prove to be incorrect for any
reason, then either party shall be entitled to an adjustment to correct the
same, provided that such party

                                      -22-
<Page>

makes written demand on the one from who it is entitled to such adjustment
within one (1) year after the erroneous payment or computation was made.

                  6.6.3     All accounts receivable flowing from the Project
shall be disposed of as follows:

                            6.6.3.1    Buyer and Seller agree to treat all base
or minimum rental payments received from a Tenant as first applicable to base or
minimum rent which was owed by that Tenant, if any, for the month in which
Closing occurs. In the event that there remains any unpaid base or minimum rent
payable to Seller for a period prior to the Closing, all payments of base or
minimum rent received from such Tenant shall be applied to sums owed Buyer
before any part thereof shall be treated as belonging to Seller. In the event
that there remains any unpaid Tenant receivable other than base or minimum rent
(including without limitation any tax, CAM, insurance or percentage rent
payments) for any period prior to the Closing, all payments received from any
Tenant in arrears shall be applied to any sums currently owed Buyer from such
Tenant (whether base or minimum rent or any other amount) before any part
thereof shall be treated as belonging to Seller.

                            6.6.3.2    In the event that any Tenant of Seller or
Buyer at the Project shall hereafter apply or shall have heretofore applied for
relief under the provisions of any bankruptcy or similar laws for the protection
of debtors, the provisions of SECTION 6.6.3.1 shall not apply, and the parties
shall have the right to seek collection of their respective accounts, their
entitlements being determined by the Closing and the other provisions of this
Agreement.

                            6.6.3.3    Neither party shall have the right to
enter into any transactions that purport to compromise claims belonging to the
other, without the other party's prior written consent.

                            6.6.3.4    If at the time of Closing any Tenants owe
Seller any money, Seller shall have the right, subsequent to the Closing, to
collect such sums directly from the Tenants including bringing lawsuits against
the tenants (at Seller's sole expense) for such collection; provided, however,
Seller agrees that any such legal action or collection shall not include any
disturbance of the possession, use or occupancy of the tenants or any right to
evict the tenants, whether pursuant to the lease provisions or otherwise, and
Buyer shall not be obligated to join in any lawsuit or in any other way to
participate or cooperate with Seller in its collection attempts, unless required
to by law for Seller to maintain its action, and in such event, Buyer will (at
Seller's expense) join in such a lawsuit or action only if the same does not
include or require disturbance of the possession of any tenants, as aforesaid.

                  6.6.4     If, within one (1) year following the Closing Date,
any Tenant makes a claim against Buyer for any overcharge paid to Seller
(Including without limitation any withholding of rent by reason thereof), Seller
will and hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and
against any loss, expense, or damage (including without limitation withheld
rents or reasonable attorney's fees) arising from or relating to any such
alleged overcharge paid to Seller or rent withholding in connection therewith.
The provisions of this SECTION 6.6.4 shall survive Closing for a period of one
year (and for such additional period as may be necessary to resolve any such
claim made within such one year period).

                  6.6.5     REMITTANCE BETWEEN PARTIES. Any amounts owed between
Buyer and Seller in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall be determined
to be delinquent thirty (30) days after notification to the party required to
make remittance. Delinquent balances shall bear interest at ten percent (10%)
per annum or, if a lesser rate, the maximum rate allowed by law; provided,
however, with respect to sums which must first be reimbursed by Tenants to
Buyer, such thirty (30)-day period shall not commence until receipt of the funds
by Buyer from the Tenants.

                                      -23-
<Page>

Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to collect and assist Seller in
collecting any revenue which is owed to Seller as of the Closing Date or in
connection with such reconciliations; however, Buyer shall not be obligated to
incur any expense in pursuing such collections and Buyer shall not be obligated
to participate in any litigation as part of such collection efforts, except for
allowing suit to be filed in Buyer's name (to the extent necessary for the
prosecution of litigation; provided however, Seller shall have no right to
terminate any Leases or dispossess Tenants from their premises) and Seller shall
indemnify Buyer for any cost or liability incurred by Buyer solely on account of
Buyer allowing suit to be filed in Buyer's name, but not for any other claims
against Buyer based upon Buyer's conduct. Seller has conducted the
reconciliation for calendar year 2003 CAM Charges pursuant to the terms of the
Leases, and Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in resolving any issues that
may arise in connection with such reconciliations, and Seller shall be
responsible for any amounts payable to Tenants, and Seller shall be entitled to
any under payments required to be made by Tenants, in connection therewith.

          6.7     ITEMS NOT TO BE PRORATED.

                  No proration shall be made for (i) insurance premiums, or (ii)
employee salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes or other employee costs.
Seller shall terminate and pay for all such services as of the Closing. Buyer
shall have no obligation to retain any of Seller's employees providing services
in connection with the ownership, management or operation of the Project, and
Seller shall be responsible for all claims of any such employees.

          6.8     SECURITY DEPOSITS.

                  All security or other deposits, including accrued interest
thereon required to be paid to Tenants under the terms of their respective
Leases, if any, being held by Seller at the date of the Closing on behalf of
Tenants under any Leases and, to the extent applicable under any Service
Contracts or other contracts (such as contracts with tenant improvement
contractors retained by Tenants, if any) shall be credited to Buyer toward
payment of the Purchase Price based upon the amount of such deposits or
obligations as set forth in the Rent Roll or the Leases, or otherwise identified
by Seller and any discrepancies as to the amount of any such deposits or of
obligations disclosed in Tenant Estoppels shall be resolved in good faith by the
parties. All refundable security or other deposits paid by Seller under the
Readerboard Sign Contract or other Service Contracts or otherwise, if any, shall
be debited to Buyer and credited to Seller.

          6.9     POSSESSION.

                  Possession of the Project shall be transferred by Seller to
Buyer upon the Closing Date, subject only to the Permitted Title Exceptions and
the rights of Tenants under validly executed written Leases which Permitted
Title Exceptions and Leases are then in full force and effect, and any temporary
or seasonal tenancies then in effect.

          6.10    CLOSING COSTS.

                  6.10.1    SELLER'S CLOSING COSTS. Seller shall pay (i)

term shall mean only the actual knowledge of Mason L. Frank and David Moore,
Seller's personnel who are most knowledgeable about the Project, and are the
most likely to receive notices and other communications concerning the Project,
after due inquiry.

                  7.1.1     LEASES. All of the Leases entered into by Seller,
and to Seller's knowledge all other Leases, were negotiated at arm's length.
With respect to each of the Leases, and except as disclosed in the Basic Rent
Roll or as otherwise specifically disclosed in writing to Buyer, the following
information is true and correct: (a) each of the Leases is in full force and
effect according to the terms set forth therein and in the Basic Rent Roll; (b)
the Leases have not been modified, amended, or altered, in writing or otherwise,
other than as so disclosed in the Basic Rent Roll; (c) to Seller's knowledge, no
Tenant is in default under or in arrears in the payment of any sums or in the
performance of any obligations required of it under its Lease nor has any event
occurred under any Lease which with the giving of notice or passage of time
constitutes a default under any Lease; (d) Seller has not applied and after the
End of the Inspection Period shall not apply without Buyer's consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, any security deposit to rent due
from any Tenant whose Lease shall not terminate prior to Closing; and (e) except
as may otherwise be provided in the Basic Rent Roll there are no unpaid
contingent or deferred allowances or incentive payments payable to Tenants. As
of the Effective Date, all of the GLA of the Project is leased except as
otherwise set forth on SCHEDULE 7.1.1 hereof.

                  7.1.2     RENT ROLL AND TENANTS. All information set forth in

right of possession to the Project or any part thereof. Additionally, no rent
concessions have

                                      -25-

days in advance by any Tenant except as shown in the Basic Rent Roll and the
Leases described therein, no Tenant has or has asserted any claim against Seller
for any security deposit or other deposits except as shown in the Basic Rent
Roll and the Leases described therein, and Seller has not received any notice
and otherwise has no actual knowledge that any Tenant has or has asserted any
defense or off-set to (i) rent accruing after the Closing Date or (ii) any other
obligations under its Lease and, except as may be disclosed on SCHEDULE 7.1.2
attached hereto, Seller has not received any notice that any Tenant has or has
asserted any claim of unfinished or defective tenant improvements constructed or
to be constructed by Seller except with respect to items which Seller has
corrected or is in the process of correcting. Seller does not have any
obligation to pay any interest or other charges to any Tenant with respect to
any security deposits held for the benefit of any Tenants except as disclosed in
the Basic Rent Roll or the Leases described therein.

                  7.1.3     AUTHORITY. Seller is a limited liability company,
properly organized and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Washington, and properly authorized to own real property in the State of
Washington. Seller is the owner of the Project and has the right, power, legal
capacity and power to enter into this Agreement and to convey the Project to
Buyer pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof and perform Seller's other
obligations hereunder. The parties and persons executing this Agreement on
behalf of Seller have been duly authorized to execute this Agreement. The
execution of this Agreement by Seller, the performance by Seller of Seller's
obligations hereunder, and the sale, transfer, conveyance and/or assignments
contemplated hereby, do not require the consent of any third party (including,
without limitation, any governmental entity) except to the extent such consents
have been obtained.

                  7.1.4     CONFORMANCE WITH LAWS. To Seller's knowledge and
except where the failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect, the
Project, including the Improvements as constructed and as operated by Seller,
conforms to, and is operated, maintained, and leased in accordance with, all
applicable city, county, state, federal and other applicable laws, statutes,
ordinances, rules and regulations.

                  7.1.5     BUILDING DOCUMENTS. Except for the Building
Documents, the Exception Documents and other materials delivered or made
available to Buyer, to Seller's knowledge, there are no other documents or
agreements binding on Buyer and/or the Project, after Buyer's acquisition of the
Project, which would have a material adverse effect on the value or operation of
the Project. Except for proprietary documents that either were executed or
delivered in connection with acquisition of the Project by Seller or relate to
construction activities at the Project and that are not reasonably necessary for
Buyer's ownership, use, operation or management of the Project, copies of all of
Seller's books and records relating to the ownership, operation and management
of the Project are being delivered to Buyer pursuant to SECTION 3.1 hereof or
are available for Buyer's inspection at the property management office at the
Project.

                  7.1.6     NO BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. Seller has not (i) made a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (ii) filed any voluntary
petition in bankruptcy or, to Seller's knowledge, suffered the filing of an
involuntary petition by Seller's creditors, (iii) suffered the appointment of a

suffered the attachment or other judicial seizure of all, or substantially all,
of Seller's assets, (v) admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts as
they come due or (vi) made an offer of settlement, extension or composition to
its creditors generally.

                  7.1.7     NO DEFAULT. Except for such matters, if any, that
have been cured prior to the date hereof and except for matters that are in the
process of being cured in connection with completion of tenant improvements by
Seller, Seller has

                                      -26-
<Page>

not received notice that Seller is in default under the terms of any Lease or
any other agreement pertaining to the Project, nor to Seller's knowledge has any
event occurred that shall constitute a default by Seller under such documents
and instruments following the passage of time or giving of notice or both.

                  7.1.8     NO HAZARDOUS WASTES. Except as may be disclosed in:
those certain (i) Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments on the
Project dated May 19, 2000, and February 20, 2001, respectively, addressed to
Landlord and prepared by Herrera Environmental Consultants, (ii) the "Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment Lakewood Towne Center 10509 Gravelly Lake Drive SW
Lakewood, Washington," prepared by Herrera Environmental Consultants, dated

correspondence listed on SCHEDULE 7.1.8 attached hereto (collectively, the
"Environmental Reports"), to Seller's knowledge there are no Hazardous
Substances on, under or around the Project, in excess of levels permitted by
applicable law or requiring any special handling beyond that customary in other
shopping centers or any notifications required by law, and Seller has received
no written notice from any third parties or any federal, state or local
governmental agency, indicating that any hazardous substance remedial or
clean-up work will be required; (y) there have not been any on-site spills,
releases, discharges or disposal of Hazardous Substances which have occurred on
the Project during Seller's ownership of the Project or to Seller's actual
knowledge, prior to Seller's ownership; and (z) to Seller's knowledge, there are
not now, nor have there been, any underground storage tanks on the Project. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Hazardous Substances" shall include all
substances which are classified as hazardous substances or hazardous wastes
under any of the following laws, rules and regulations: (i) the Toxic Substances
Control Act, 15 U.S.C., Section 2601 et seq., (ii) the Clean Water Act, 33
U.S.C., Section 1251 et seq., (iii) the Resource and Conservation and Recovery
Act, 42 U.S.C., Section 6901 et seq., (iv) the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C., Section 9601, et seq., or
(v) other federal or Washington laws, rules or regulations.

                  7.1.9     NO LITIGATION. Except as may be disclosed in
SCHEDULE 7.1.9 hereof or as otherwise specifically disclosed in writing to
Buyer, Seller has no notice, nor is Seller otherwise aware of, any litigation
relating to the Project, or, to the best of Seller's knowledge, is there any
pending or threatened litigation, or asserted or unasserted claim, relating to
the Project. Seller maintains commercial general liability insurance for the
Project which, in Seller's opinion, should cover any liability of Seller with
respect to the "Potential Claims" disclosed on SCHEDULE 7.1.9 attached hereto in
excess of Seller's insurance deductibles therefor.

                  7.1.10    NO NOTICES. Seller has not received, and has no
knowledge of, any notification from any city, county, state or federal authority
having jurisdiction over the Project requiring any work to be done to, or
affecting the use of, the Project or any portion thereof. Seller has received no
notice from any insurance carrier, nor is Seller aware, of defects or
inadequacies in the Project that if not corrected would result in termination of
insurance coverage or increase in insurance costs.

                  7.1.11    NO UNDISCLOSED ASSESSMENTS. To Seller's knowledge,
there are no taxes, assessments or bonds affecting the Property, or any portion
thereof, except as disclosed in the Title Commitment or in the tax bills
delivered to Buyer. Seller has no understanding or agreement with any taxing
authority respecting the imposition or deferment of any taxes or assessments
respecting the Project; however, Seller is aware that there is an agreement
between the City of Lakewood and ATC Realty Sixteen, Inc., concerning the
dedication to the public of 59th Avenue.

                  7.1.12    NO VIOLATION OF OTHER AGREEMENTS. Neither this
Agreement nor anything provided to be done hereunder (including, but not limited
to, the transfer of the Project to Buyer) violates or shall violate any
contract, document, understanding, agreement or instrument to which Seller is a
party or by which Seller

                                      -27-
<Page>

may be bound, or any contract, document, understanding, agreement or instrument
affecting the Project.

                  7.1.13    OPERATING STATEMENTS. All operating statements
delivered to Buyer by Seller for periods commencing January 1, 2002 and
thereafter are, to Seller's knowledge: accurate, true and correct, have been
accurately compiled from the books and records of the Project and accurately set
forth the results of the operation of the Project for the periods covered;
except as disclosed in such statements, there has been no material adverse
change in the condition or operation of the Project since the period covered by
the operating statements; and the financial records kept by Seller reflect all
material transactions affecting or relating to the Project.

                  7.1.14    PROJECT CONSTRUCTION. Except where the failure to do
so would not have a material adverse effect on the Project, the Improvements
constructed by Seller since November 1, 2001, were constructed in substantial
conformance with the plans and specifications therefor, as well as documents
approved by the appropriate governmental officials, and, to Seller's knowledge
and except for punch list items which Seller is in the process of correcting,
are free of construction defects.

                  7.1.15    SERVICE CONTRACTS. Except for the Service Contracts
delivered to Buyer pursuant to SECTION 3.1.3 hereof, there are no contracts or
other oral or written agreements for services, supplies or materials, affecting
the use, operation or management of the Project that will continue in effect
after the Closing Date and Buyer will not have any obligations under any
construction contracts for tenant improvements or other capital items entered
into by Seller after the Closing hereunder, and none of such construction
contracts will have any material adverse affect on the Project. There are no
Service Contracts relating to the maintenance or operation of the Project that
cannot be terminated on notice of thirty (30) days or less, without cost or
expense to Buyer except for the Readerboard Sign Contract, which Buyer shall
assume at the Closing. Seller is also a party to an exclusive use listing
agreement with CB Richard Ellis with respect to the Project and the Neighborhood
Center. Seller has the right to terminate such listing agreement with respect to
the Project in connection with the sale of the Project to Buyer.

                  7.1.16    UTILITIES AVAILABLE. All utilities necessary for the
operation of the Project in accordance with its intended use are available to
the Land.

                  7.1.17    ZONING AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INFORMATION. To
Seller's knowledge: there is no pending or threatened proceeding to alter or
restrict the zoning restrictions applicable to the Project and there is no
pending or threatened action or governmental proceeding in eminent domain or
zoning change that would materially adversely affect the Project. Seller is
obligated to dedicate 59th Avenue to the public and it is contemplated that such
dedication will occur prior to the Closing Date.

                  7.1.18    PERMITS AND AUTHORIZATIONS. SCHEDULE 7.1.18
constitutes a list, to Seller's knowledge, of all of the material permits and
authorizations issued to Seller and in Seller's possession or control in effect
as of this date with respect to the Project (including but not limited to
certificates of occupancy or local equivalent). Seller shall use Seller's
diligent efforts to maintain all permits and authorizations with respect to the
Project now in effect in effect as of the Closing Date and such permits and
authorizations will be delivered to Buyer on the Closing Date. Material pending
applications, if any, will not be withdrawn or permitted to lapse without
Buyer's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer of all material pending applications.

                  7.1.19    NO PURCHASE RIGHTS. Except as may be set forth in
the Leases, Seller has not granted, and to Seller's knowledge no prior owner has
granted,

                                      -28-
<Page>

any Tenant under any lease or other person any option, right of first refusal or
other right to purchase the Project as a whole that is currently in effect.

          7.2     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER.

                  Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller, for the
benefit of Seller and Seller's successors and assigns, that the following
statements are true as of the date of this Agreement, and shall be true as of
the Closing Date except to the extent that Buyer gives Seller written notice of
changes to the representations and warranties prior to the Closing Date.

                  7.2.1     AUTHORITY; REQUIRED APPROVALS. Buyer is an Illinois
corporation, properly organized under the laws of the State of Illinois. Buyer
has the right, power, legal capacity and power to enter into this Agreement and
to acquire the Project from Seller pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof
and perform Buyer's obligations hereunder. The parties and persons executing
this Agreement on behalf of Buyer have been duly authorized to execute this
Agreement. All required approvals or consents have been obtained in connection
with the execution of this Agreement by Buyer and with the performance by Buyer
of Buyer's obligations hereunder. Buyer has full right and authority to enter
into and fully perform its obligations under this Agreement.

                  7.2.2     NO CONFLICTS. Neither this Agreement nor anything
provided to be done hereunder violates or shall violate any contract, document,
understanding, Agreement or instrument to which Buyer is a party or by which
Buyer may be bound.

          7.3     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

                  The representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller in this
Agreement shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date and neither party may bring an action against the other for a claim of
misrepresentation or a breach of a representation or warranty or a similar claim
later than the date twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (which date for
bringing an action shall be extended to the date twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date provided that the party bringing the action provided written notice
of the claim to the other party prior to the date twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date) and any such claim subsequently filed shall be barred.

          7.4     "AS IS"; "WHERE IS".

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is
expressly understood and agreed that subject to the right of Buyer to terminate
at or prior to the End of the Inspection Period and except for the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in SECTION 7.1 of this
Agreement, Buyer is acquiring the Property "As Is" and "Where Is" and that
Seller has not made any other representations or warranties, expressed or
implied with respect to the quality, physical condition, expenses, value of the
Project, improvements thereon or any other matter or thing affecting or related
to the Project (including without limitation, warranties of habitability,
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose), which
might be pertinent in considering whether to purchase the Project, and Buyer
does hereby expressly acknowledge that no such other representations or
warranties have been made. Seller is not liable or bound in any manner by any
warranties, either expressed or implied, guarantees, promises, statements,
representations, or information pertaining to the Project or the value thereof
made or furnished by any broker, agent, employee, servant or other person
representing or purporting to represent Seller.

                           8. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

          8.1     TERMINATION.

                  In the event of (i) a default by Seller, or (ii) the failure
of any of Buyer's Conditions or other conditions to the Closing to be satisfied
or waived by Buyer, or (iii) a termination of this Agreement pursuant to the
operation of SECTION 11.1, then and in any of such events, this Agreement may be
canceled and terminated by Buyer. In the event that Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence or if Seller terminates
this Agreement because of the failure of any of Seller's Conditions, all funds
and documents previously delivered, including without limitation copies thereof,
shall be returned to the party delivering same; provided however, in the event
the Closing fails to occur by reason of Buyer's default, then Seller shall be
entitled solely to liquidated damages as provided in SECTION 8.2. In the event
of a default by Seller, including, but not limited to, any material incorrect
representation(s) or warranty(ies), whether or not such default results in
termination, Buyer shall have such remedies against Seller as may be available
to Buyer either at law or in equity, including the right to specifically enforce
this Agreement.

          8.2     LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.

                  SELLER WAIVES THE RIGHT TO SPECIFICALLY ENFORCE THIS
AGREEMENT. IN THE EVENT THE CLOSING FAILS TO OCCUR BY REASON OF BUYER'S DEFAULT
AFTER THE END OF THE INSPECTION PERIOD, SELLER AND BUYER AGREE THAT, BASED ON
THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW EXISTING, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SELLER AND BUYER EACH
RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE EXCESSIVELY COSTLY AND IMPRACTICABLE TO
ESTABLISH SELLER'S DAMAGES BY REASON OF BUYER'S DEFAULT AND IT WOULD BE
REASONABLE TO AWARD SELLER LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST MONEY
DEPOSIT MADE BY BUYER; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IN ANY EVENT IN WHICH THE EARNEST
MONEY DEPOSIT EXCEEDS FIVE PERCENT (5%) OF THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY AMENDMENT HERETO, THE DIFFERENCE REPRESENTED BY SUCH EXCESS
SHALL BE RETURNED TO BUYER UPON SELLER'S EXERCISE OF SUCH REMEDY. THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS PROVISION IS INTENDED TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF RCW
64.04.005(1)(a); IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED TO BE A LIMITATION UPON ANY RIGHT OR
REMEDY AVAILABLE TO SELLER IN THE EVENT OF ANY OTHER DEFAULT OR INDEMNITY ON THE
PART OF BUYER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT; AND DOES NOT AFFECT
SELLER'S RIGHT TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS' FEES IN ANY ACTION COMMENCED WITH RESPECT
TO THIS AGREEMENT. BOTH PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH AMOUNT STATED AS LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLER'S DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF BUYER'S
DEFAULT AND SUCH AMOUNT SHALL BE IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER MONETARY OR EQUITABLE
RELIEF TO WHICH SELLER MAY OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED BY VIRTUE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
BY OPERATION OF LAW. ACCORDINGLY, SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RETAIN SUCH AMOUNT
AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR BUYER'S BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FAILURE TO
COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY AS PROVIDED HEREIN. BUYER'S REFUSAL TO
CLOSE BECAUSE OF BUYER'S REJECTION OF THE PROJECT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE
INSPECTION PERIOD FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER, SHALL NOT BE A
DEFAULT. SELLER HEREBY AGREES THAT LIQUIDATED MONETARY DAMAGES, AS STIPULATED
HEREINABOVE, SHALL BE THE SOLE REMEDY OF SELLER IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY
BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF BUYER'S
OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.

                            9. REAL ESTATE COMMISSION

          Seller has been represented in this transaction by Secured Capital
Corporation ("SCC") and SCC has retained CB Richard Ellis ("CBRE"). Seller shall
be responsible for any fees or commissions to SCC and SCC shall be responsible
for any fee or commission payable to CBRE. Seller and Buyer represent and
warrant to each other that they have employed no other broker and/or finder in
connection with this Agreement. Seller and Buyer each agree that, to the extent
a brokerage and/or finder's fee shall have been earned or claimed in connection
with this Agreement, the payment of such fees and the defense of any action in
connection therewith shall be the sole and exclusive obligation of the party who
requested the services of the broker and/or finder. In the event that any claim,
demand or cause of action for brokerage and/or finder's fees is asserted against
a party to this Agreement who did not request such services, the party through
whom the broker or finder is making the claim shall indemnify, defend (with an
attorney of indemnitee's choice) and hold harmless the other party from and
against any and all such claims, demands and causes of action.


                                 10. ASSIGNMENT

          Buyer shall not have the right to assign Buyer's interest under this
Agreement without Seller's prior written consent, which consent may be withheld
in Seller's sole discretion; provided however, subject to Buyer giving written
notice to Seller within five (5) business days after any such assignment, Buyer
shall have the right to assign Buyer's rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any one (1) (but not more than one) subsidiary of a real estate
investment trust affiliated with The Inland Real Estate Group, Inc. provided (i)
such assignee expressly assumes the obligations of Buyer hereunder in writing
and an originally executed copy of any such assignment and assumption (in which
Seller is named a third party beneficiary) is delivered to Seller prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) such assignee is, or on the Closing Date will be,
properly authorized to own real property in the State of Washington. Any such
assignee shall succeed to all the rights of Buyer hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no such assignment shall relieve Buyer from Buyer's liability under
this Agreement.


                                11. MISCELLANEOUS

          11.1    MATERIAL DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION.

                  If the Project is materially damaged or if the Project or any
part thereof is materially taken by condemnation or there is any condemnation or
threatened condemnation of any direct or indirect access to the Project prior to
the Closing Date, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
and reject the Project and, on Buyer's written notice to Seller and Escrow
Holder, the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and this Agreement
shall be terminated forthwith and neither Seller nor Buyer shall thereafter have
any obligation to each other, except as set forth in SECTION 8.1 above and
except as otherwise specifically set forth herein with respect to matters which
survive termination of this Agreement. In the alternative, Buyer may elect to
complete the transaction on the terms set forth in this Agreement and, in such
event, or in the event there is damage to the Project that does not result in
the Project being "materially damaged" as defined below (provided Seller and
Buyer agree in their respective sole discretion on the amount of a reduction in
the Purchase Price to reflect the costs of repairing such damage), and Seller
shall retain the right to all insurance proceeds allocable to the restoration of
the damaged Project or given as consideration for the taking. By "materially
damaged," Seller and Buyer mean damaged to the extent (i) of any uninsured
damage unless Seller agrees to pay Buyer the entire amount of such

                                      -31-
<Page>

uninsured damage, (ii) the cost to repair such damage or destruction to the
Project exceeds the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00), or
(iii) any damage that allows a Lead Tenant to terminate its Lease. By
"materially taken," Seller and Buyer mean a condemnation or taking by eminent
domain occurring on the Project that results in the elimination of more than
five percent (5%) of the Project, the elimination of more than five percent (5%)
of the total gross square footage of the land comprising the Land, the
elimination of more than either five percent (5%) of the parking areas at the
Project or such portion of the parking areas such that the remaining parking
areas do not provide sufficient parking to comply with applicable governmental
requirements, or the elimination of any GLA in the Improvements at the Project
or which otherwise permits any Lead Tenant to abate its rent or terminate its
Lease. The phrase "taking by eminent domain" includes any notices of taking or
commencement of proceedings under eminent domain power, but excludes any claim
for inverse condemnation. Seller is not aware of any claim or threatened claim
of inverse condemnation.

          11.2    ATTORNEYS' AND OTHER FEES.

                  Should either party institute any action or proceeding to
enforce or interpret this Agreement or any provision hereof, for damages by
reason of any alleged breach of this Agreement or of any provision hereof, or
for a declaration of rights hereunder, the prevailing party in any such action
or proceeding shall be entitled to receive from the other party all costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and other fees, incurred by the
prevailing party in connection with such action or proceeding. The term
"attorneys' and other fees" shall mean and include attorneys' fees, accountants'
fees, and any and all other similar fees incurred in connection with the action
or proceeding and preparations therefor. The term "action or proceeding" shall
mean and include actions, proceedings, suits, arbitrations, appeals and other
similar proceedings.

          11.3    NOTICES.

                  Any notice, demand, request, covenant, approval or other
communication to be given by one party to the other shall be given by personal
service, express mail, Federal Express, DHL or any other similar form of
nationally recognized airborne/overnight delivery service, or mailing in the
United States mail (certified mail, return receipt requested), or by
electronically-confirmed telefacsimile transmission, addressed to the parties at

                          ESCROW AND LEASING AGREEMENT


     THIS ESCROW AND LEASING AGREEMENT is made as of ____________, 2004, by and
among MBK NORTHWEST, LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("Seller"),
______________________, a ____________________ ("Buyer"), and __________________
______________, a ____________ corporation, as escrow holder ("Escrow Holder"),
with reference to the following facts (certain capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Glossary attached
hereto as Exhibit "A"):

     A.   Seller and Buyer[, AS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO ________________, A
____________________,] are parties to that certain Agreement for Purchase and
Sale of Real Property and Escrow Instructions dated as of ___________, 2004 (the
"Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Buyer has acquired concurrently with
execution of this Agreement from Seller that certain real property commonly
known as the "Power Center" at Lakewood Towne Center, located in the City of
Lakewood, Pierce County, Washington (the "Project").

     B.   The Purchase Price paid by Buyer to Seller under the Purchase
Agreement is based, in part, on all of the GLA of the Project being leased by
tenants; therefore, the "Required Leasing Level," as such term is defined in
Section 2.4 of the Purchase Agreement, has not been satisfied. The Required
Leasing Level has not been met in that approximately _______ square feet of GLA
of the Project constitutes Vacant Leased Space or Unleased Space, as such terms
are defined in Exhibit "A" attached hereto.

     C.   It will be necessary to incur various leasing related expenses,
including without limitation leasing commissions and costs of constructing
tenant improvements (including design and permit costs) for the Vacant Leased
Space and Unleased Space to qualify as Approved Leases, as such terms are
defined in Exhibit "A." Seller has no obligation hereunder with respect to any
space at the Project other than Vacant Leased Space and Unleased Space.

     D.   As more fully set forth below, the amount to be deposited in the
Escrow Account is based on eighteen (18) months' base rent and estimated common
operating expenses (including taxes and insurance) for the Unleased Space at the
Project, as well as leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs for
possible Approved Leases for the Unleased Space at the Project.

     E.   Seller and Buyer also desire to deposit into the Escrow Account: (i)
base rent and estimated common operating expenses (including taxes and
insurance) for varying periods of time depending on the date the applicable
Tenant is obligated to

                                       1
<Page>

begin paying rent, unpaid leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs for
Vacant Leased Space in the Project (that is, space which has been leased but not
yet occupied by Tenants), (ii) the estimated amount for the "hard" and "soft"
costs of construction of the Theatre Related Improvements, and (iii) the amount
of the base rent concession under the LaPalma Mexican restaurant lease (the
"LaPalma Lease") through the period ending January 31, 2005.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing facts, and the mutual
covenants and conditions set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

     1.   APPOINTMENT. Seller and Buyer hereby appoint Escrow Holder as escrow
holder for the Escrow Account and for the purposes set forth herein, and Escrow
Holder hereby accepts such appointment in accordance with the terms hereof.

     2.   ESCROW ACCOUNT.

          2.1     GENERAL; INVESTMENT. Seller hereby deposits with Escrow

($_______) as security for Seller's obligations with respect to the Vacant
Leased Space and the Unleased Space in the Project, which Escrow Holder hereby
agrees to hold in the Escrow Account and to disburse and dispose of in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All funds in the Escrow Account
will be deposited by Escrow Holder in an interest bearing account which permits
withdrawal on not more than three (3) days' notice. Such funds may also be
invested in money market funds as directed in writing by Buyer. Interest earned
on the funds in the Escrow Account will be distributed as set forth herein.
Escrow Holder shall establish subaccounts of the Escrow Account for each of the
categories set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.2 hereof.

                  Escrow Holder, upon the written instruction of Buyer, and
approval thereof in writing by Seller, shall cause the funds in the Escrow
Account to be invested in a money market account or certificates of deposit
issued by Bank of America N.A. (the "Bank"), or if no such instruction is given,
in a money market account maintained at the Bank. Escrow Holder is hereby
authorized to cash the certificates of deposit or other financial instruments
held by Escrow Holder pursuant to this Agreement in order to make disbursements
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Escrow Holder is further
authorized to reinvest any portion of the Escrow Account remaining after any
such disbursement, or any portion thereof upon the maturity of any certificate
of deposit in the manner permitted herein. If Escrow Holder does not receive
instructions with respect to reinvestment, Escrow Holder shall deposit any funds
in the Escrow Account in an interest bearing money market account at the Bank.

paid such costs itself, to reimburse Seller provided Seller submits to Buyer and
Escrow Holder reasonable evidence of Seller's payment of such amounts, after the
following conditions have been satisfied;

                            3.2.1.1    The portion of the tenant improvements

                            3.2.1.2    Interim disbursements for tenant
improvements will be in the amount of ninety percent (90%) of labor and one

permit fees and construction costs, as well as miscellaneous leasing costs,
including without limitation attorneys' fees, but shall exclude leasing

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if the Tenant under

respective premises and the Approved Lease provides that the landlord is to
provide a tenant improvement allowance to such Tenant, the amount of tenant
improvement allowance deposited hereunder shall be disbursed in accordance with
the terms of the Approved Lease and to the extent Seller has paid such tenant
improvement allowance, such amount shall be payable to Seller provided that
Seller provides Buyer and Escrow Holder with reasonable evidence of Seller's
payment of such tenant improvement allowance. Each request for disbursement

containing a certification by Seller that all tenant improvement work for which
payment is requested has been satisfactorily completed and upon payment of the

supplied materials and who are to be paid by such disbursement. Such Application
and Certification shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "D" and shall
also be approved by Buyer (as evidenced by Buyer signing thereon before the
disbursement is made).

costs shall be disbursed to Seller up to one (1) time per month within five (5)
business days after Escrow Holder's receipt of an Application and Certificate

Section 3.6 hereof, which amounts shall be subject to the maximum amounts
therefor set forth in clause (iv) of Section 2.2.

with respect to the applicable Approved Lease. Such notice shall be in the form
of Exhibit "E" attached hereto and shall be executed by Seller and approved by
Buyer except as otherwise provided in Section 3.6 hereof. The amount of leasing
commissions to be disbursed under this Section for Unleased Space and Vacant
Leased Space, respectively, shall be as set forth on Exhibits "B" and "B-1,"

Escrow Account allocated for Theatre Related Improvements (as set forth in
clause (v) of Section 2.2 hereof), shall be disbursed by Escrow Holder to pay
the costs thereof to contractors and vendors providing labor or material, or in
the event Seller has paid such costs itself, to reimburse Seller provided Seller
submits to Buyer and Escrow Holder reasonable evidence of Seller's payment of
such amounts, after the following conditions have been satisfied:

                            3.2.4.1    The portion of the Theatre Related

                         SECOND COMBINED LEASE AMENDMENT
                   (PLITT THEATRES, INC., DBA CLNEPLEX ODEON)

     THIS SECOND COMBINED LEASE AMENDMENT (this "SECOND COMBINED LEASE
AMENDMENT"), made as of April ____, 2004 (the "EXECUTION DATE"), by and between
MBK NORTHWEST LLC, a Washington limited liability company ("LANDLORD"), and
PLITT THEATRES, INC., a Delaware corporation dba Cineplex Odeon ("TENANT").

                                 R E C I T A L S

     A.   By Lease dated December 6, 1989, as amended by First Lease Amendment
dated August 24, 1995 (as amended, the "ORIGINAL LEASE"), Lakewood Mall II
Limited Partnership, a Washington limited partnership ("ORIGINAL LANDLORD"),
leased to Tenant, and Tenant leased from Original Landlord certain premises (the
"ORIGINAL PREMISES") located in that certain shopping center commonly known as
Lakewood Towne Center and formerly known as Lakewood Mall (the "SHOPPING
CENTER"), located in Lakewood, Washington.

     B.   By Lease dated August 24, 1995, as amended by First Lease Amendment
dated April 1, 1996, and by Second Lease Amendment dated May 27, 1997 (as
amended, the "EXPANSION LEASED"), Original Landlord leased to Tenant and Tenant
leased from Original Landlord certain additional premises (the "EXPANSION
PREMISES") in the Shopping Center.

     C.   The Original Lease and the Expansion Lease were amended by that
certain Amendment to Leases dated March 31, 2002 (the "FIRST COMBINED LEASE
AMENDMENT").

     D.   The Original Lease and the Expansion Lease, as amended by the First
Combined Lease Amendment, are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as
the "Leases" and individually as a "Lease." The Original Premises and the
Expansion Premises are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"PREMISES". The current term of each of the Leases (without taking into account
unexercised extension options) is scheduled to expire on November 30, 2011,
subject to earlier termination as expressly provided therein.

     E.   Landlord is a successor-in-interest to Original Landlord.

     F.   In connection with Landlord's redevelopment of the Shopping Center,
and in consideration of Landlord constructing an exterior facade to the Premises
and

                                        1
<Page>

completing the other "Landlord's Refurbishment Work" {defined below), the
parties desire to modify each of the Leases to accommodate Landlord's
Refurbishment Work, to revise the termination rights of Landlord and Tenant
under the First Combined Lease Amendment and to modify Tenant's rental
obligations under the Leases, as set forth herein.

     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

     1.   EXTERIOR CONSTRUCTION. Landlord hereby agrees, at Landlord's sole cost
and expense, to: (i) remove the remaining portion of the former enclosed mall
improvements located adjacent to the Premises and replace such area with a
parking area and related common area improvements substantially as shown on the
Site Plan attached hereto as EXHIBIT "A" and incorporated herein by this
reference, and (ii) modify and reconstruct the exterior facade of the Premises
(collectively, "LANDLORD'S REFURBISHMENT WORK"). Landlord shall deliver detailed
plans and specifications for Landlord's Refurbishment Work to Tenant within ten
(10) days after the date hereof for Tenant's review and approval (which approval
Tenant agrees shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed provided that the
same are substantially as shown on the elevations attached hereto as EXHIBIT "B"
and incorporated herein by this reference). Subject to Landlord obtaining
building permits therefor (which Landlord agrees to apply for by May 15, 2004
and thereafter use diligent efforts to obtain), Landlord agrees to commence
Landlord's Refurbishment Work by the later to occur of (a) July 6, 2004, or (b)
forty-five (45) days after an executed, notarized copy of this Second Combined
Lease Amendment has been delivered by Tenant to Landlord and to complete
Landlord's Refurbishment Work within one hundred and forty (140) days
thereafter, subject to "unavoidable delays" within the meaning of such term set
forth in Section 15.10 of the Expansion Lease. All work to be performed by
Landlord under this Section 1 shall be promptly performed in accordance with the
construction practices of first-class shopping standards in the State of
Washington, in a lien-free, good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with
applicable legal requirements. Landlord shall endeavor to minimize the
interference with Tenant's business caused by Landlord's Refurbishment Work.
Subject to Tenant's obtaining permits therefor from the City of Lakewood, Tenant
shall furnish and install new identification signage on the exterior of the
Premises at Tenant's sole cost and expense, which signage shall be subject to
Landlord's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Landlord shall promptly notify Tenant if, as and when
Landlord's Refurbishment Work is substantially completed.

     2.   MINIMUM RENT. Section 2 of the First Combined Lease Amendment sets
forth Tenant's Minimum Rent obligations under the Leases. Currently and through
December 31, 2004, Tenant's Annual Minimum Rent is payable at the rate of Three
Hundred Eight Thousand Two Hundred Forty-Five Dollars Eighty Cents ($308,245.80)

                                        2
<Page>

per annum under the Original Lease and through November 30, 2006 two Hundred
Eight Thousand Five Hundred Seventy Dollars Eight Cents ($208,570.08) per annum
under the Expansion Lease, for an aggregate Minimum Rent of Five Hundred Sixteen
Thousand Eight Hummed Fifteen Dollars Eighty-Eight Cents ($516,815.88) per annum
("CURRENT ANNUAL MINIMUM RENT"), Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to
the contrary contained in the Original Lease, the Expansion Lease or the First
Combined Lease Amendment, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that during the
period from the Execution Date to the date which is three (3) years after
substantial completion of Landlord's Refurbishment Work (the "CONSTRUCTION
COMPLETION DATE"), Tenant shall pay the Current Annual Minimum Rent to Landlord
(instead of the Minimum Rent set forth in the schedule set forth in Section 2 of
the First Combined Lease Amendment) as follows:

          (a)  MINIMUM RENT UNDER THE ORIGINAL LEASE

                     <S>            <C>
                     $ 308,245.80   $  25,687.15

                     $ 208,570.08   $  17,380.84
</Table>

Thereafter, Tenant's Annual Minimum Rent shall be as follows through and
including November 30, 2011, or the earlier termination of the Leases:

          (c)  MINIMUM RENT UNDER THE ORIGINAL LEASE

                                        3
<Page>

          All other amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord under the Leases, or
any amendments thereto, shall continue to be payable in accordance with the
terms thereof. Nothing contained herein is intended to modify amounts payable as
Minimum Rent under the Leases for any duly exercised Option to extend the Term
of the Original Lease or the Expansion Lease, as applicable. Minimum Rent for
each such Extension Term shall be calculated based on the Minimum Rent which
would have been in effect during the Lease Year immediately preceding the
commencement of such Extension Term, without regard to this Second Combined
Lease Amendment.

     3.   EARLY TERMINATION. Section 5 of the First Combined Lease Amendment is
hereby amended by adding the following provisions at the end of such Section 5:

          "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein (i) no
     Termination Notice delivered by Landlord pursuant to this Section 5 shall
     provide for a termination date prior to the date that is one (1) year after
     the Construction Completion Date (defined in Section 2 of this Second
     Combined Lease Amendment), and (ii) no Termination Notice delivered by
     Tenant pursuant to this Section 5 shall provide for a termination date
     prior to the date that is the earlier of (x) thirty (30) months after the
     Construction Completion Date or (y) April 1, 2007."

     4.   BINDING EFFECT. This Second Combined Lease Amendment shall be binding
on the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

     5.   REPRESENTATION REGARDING AUTHORITY. Landlord represents and warrants
to Tenant that San Diego National Bank, a national banking association
("LENDER") is the holder of the only mortgage, ground lease or other lien
superior to the Leases which requires the consent of the holder thereof to the
effectiveness of this Second Combined Lease Amendment. Landlord covenants and
agrees to use Landlord's reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent of
Lender to this Second Combined Lease Amendment and shall promptly notify Tenant
if, as and when the consent of Lender is so obtained (which notice shall be
accompanied by a copy of such consent). If such consent is not obtained within
thirty (30) days after the date hereof, this Second Combined Lease Amendment
shall be null and void and of no further force or effect. Subject to Landlord
obtaining such consent from San Diego National Bank, Landlord hereby represents
and warrants to Tenant that Landlord has the authority to enter into this Second
Combined Lease Amendment and has obtained all consents necessary for the
execution hereof by Landlord and the taking of the actions of Landlord
contemplated hereby. Tenant hereby represents and warrants to Landlord that
Tenant has the authority to enter into this Second Combined Lease Amendment and
has

                                        4
<Page>

obtained all consents necessary for the execution hereof by Tenant and the
taking of the actions of Tenant contemplated hereby.

     6.   RATIFICATION; FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. Except as otherwise specifically
set forth herein, all of the other terms and conditions of the Original Lease,
the Expansion Lease and the First Combined Lease Amendment shall remain in full
force and effect.

     7.   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. If there is any conflict or inconsistency
between the terms and conditions of this Second Combined Lease Amendment and the
terms and conditions of the Leases, the terms and conditions of this Second
Combined Lease Amendment shall govern and control the rights and obligations of
the parties. This Second Combined Lease Amendment shall be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Washington.
In the event any action is instituted by either party for the purpose of
enforcing or interpreting any provision of this Second Combined Lease Amendment,
the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to such party's reasonable
attorneys' fees, expert witnesses' fees and related costs. This Second Combined
Lease Amendment may he executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute
an original and all of which, together, shall constitute a single instrument.
Facsimile signatures to this Second Combined Lease Amendment shall count the
same as originals.

     IN WITNESS THEREOF, The parties have executed this Second Combined Lease
Amendment as of the Execution Date.

                                          LANDLORD:
