                                CREDIT AGREEMENT

      THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of the 8th day of February, 2002 (this
"Agreement"), is made between RADIAN GROUP INC., a Delaware corporation with its
principal offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the "Borrower"), and FIRST
UNION NATIONAL BANK ("First Union" or "Lender").

                                    RECITALS

      A. The Borrower has requested that the Lender make available to the
Borrower a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of
$50,000,000. The Borrower will use the proceeds of this facility to provide for
the working capital and general corporate requirements of the Borrower and its
subsidiaries, to pay certain transaction fees and expenses in connection
herewith and to finance permitted acquisitions by the Borrower or any of its
subsidiaries.

      B. The Lender is willing to make available to the Borrower the credit
facility described herein subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual provisions, covenants and
agreements herein contained, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   DEFINITIONS

      1.1 Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, in addition to the
terms defined elsewhere herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set
forth below (such meanings to be equally applicable to the singular and plural
forms thereof):

      "Account Designation Letter" shall mean a letter from the Borrower to the
Lender, duly completed and signed by an Authorized Officer and in form and
substance satisfactory to the Lender, listing any one or more accounts to which
the Borrower may from time to time request the Lender to forward the proceeds of
any Loans made hereunder.

      "Acquisition" shall mean any transaction or series of related
transactions, consummated on or after the date hereof, by which the Borrower
directly, or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, (i) acquires any going
business, or all or substantially all of the assets, of any Person, whether
through purchase of assets, merger or otherwise, or (ii) acquires securities or
other ownership interests of any Person having at least a majority of combined
voting power of the then outstanding securities or other ownership interests of
such Person.

      "Adjusted LIBOR Rate" shall mean, at any time with respect to any Loan, a
rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate as in effect at such time plus the
Applicable Margin Percentage.


                                       1
<PAGE>
      "Affiliate" shall mean, as to any Person, each other Person that directly,
or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, owns or controls, is
controlled by or under common control with such Person. For purposes of this
definition, with respect to any Person "control" shall mean (i) the possession,
direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise, or (ii) the beneficial ownership of
securities or other ownership interests of such Person having 10% or more of the
combined voting power of the then outstanding securities or other ownership
interests of such Person ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing under
special circumstances) having the right to vote in the election of directors or
other governing body of such Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) no
individual shall be an "Affiliate" of any Person or of any of its Subsidiaries
solely by reason of such individual being a director, officer or employee of
such Person or any of its Subsidiaries; and (y) the Lender shall not be an
Affiliate of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

      "Agreement" shall mean this Credit Agreement, as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time.

      "Annual Statement" shall mean, with respect to any Insurance Subsidiary
for any fiscal year, the annual financial statements of such Insurance
Subsidiary as required to be filed with the Insurance Regulatory Authority of
its jurisdiction of domicile and in accordance with the laws of such
jurisdiction, together with all exhibits, schedules, certificates and actuarial
opinions required to be filed or delivered therewith.

      "Applicable Margin Percentage" shall mean, at any time from and after the
Closing Date, (a) for purposes of determining the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, (i) 0.55%
if the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Capitalization
is equal to or less than .2 : 1.0 and (ii) 0.625% if the ratio of Consolidated
Indebtedness to Consolidate Total Capitalization is greater than .2 : 1.0; and
(b) for purposes of calculating the commitment fee payable pursuant to SECTION
2.9(b), (i) 0.125% if the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated
Total Capitalization is equal to or less than .2 : 1.0 and (ii) 0.15% if the

greater than .2 : 1.0. On each Adjustment Date (as hereinafter defined), the
Applicable Margin Percentage for LIBOR Loans and the commitment fee payable
pursuant to SECTION 2.9(b) shall be adjusted effective as of such date (based
upon the calculation of the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated
Total Capitalization as of the last day of the fiscal period to which such
Adjustment Date relates) in accordance with this definition; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, if
at any time the Borrower shall have failed to deliver the financial statements
and a Compliance Certificate as required by SECTION 5.1(a) or SECTION 5.1(b), as
the case may be, and SECTION 5.3(a), or if at any time an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, then at the election of the Lender, at all

Certificate are required to have been delivered (or the date of occurrence of
such Event of Default, as the case may be) to the date on which the same shall
have been delivered (or such Event of Default cured or waived, as the case may
be), each Applicable Margin Percentage shall be determined in accordance with
this definition as if the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated
Total Capitalization was greater than .2 : 1.0 (notwithstanding the actual
ratio). For purposes of this definition, "Adjustment Date" shall mean, with
respect to any fiscal period of the Borrower beginning with the fiscal quarter
ending March 31, 2002, the fifth

such fiscal period and (ii) a duly completed Compliance Certificate with respect
to such fiscal period. Until the first Adjustment Date, each Applicable Margin

discretion of the Lender, be given later than the times specified hereinabove.
Each such notice (each, a "Notice of Borrowing") shall be irrevocable, shall be
given in the form of EXHIBIT B-1 and shall specify (1) the aggregate principal
amount and initial Type of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (2)
in the case of a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the initial Interest Period to be
applicable thereto, and (3) the requested date of such Borrowing (the "Borrowing
Date"), which shall be a Business Day. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein:

            (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing comprised of
      Base Rate Loans shall not be less than $3,000,000 or, if greater, an
      integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, in the
      amount of the aggregate Unutilized Commitments), and the aggregate
      principal amount of each Borrowing comprised of LIBOR Loans shall not be
      less than $3,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
      excess thereof;

            (ii) if the Borrower shall have failed to designate the Type of
      Loans comprising a Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
      requested a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Loans; and

            (iii) if the Borrower shall have failed to select the duration of
      the Interest Period to be applicable to any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, then
      the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period with a
      duration of one month;

      (c) Not later than 1:00 p.m., Charlotte time, on the requested Borrowing
Date, the Lender will make such amounts available to the Borrower.

      2.3 Disbursements.

      (a) The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender to disburse the proceeds of
each Borrowing in accordance with the terms of any written instructions from any
of the Authorized Officers, provided that the Lender shall not be obligated
under any circumstances to forward amounts to any account not listed in an
Account Designation Letter. The Borrower may at any time deliver to the Lender
an Account Designation Letter listing any additional accounts or deleting any
accounts listed in a previous Account Designation Letter.

      (b) The Lender may, at its option, make and maintain any Loan at, to or
for the account of any of its Lending Offices, provided that any exercise of
such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan
to or for the account of the Lender in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.


                                       15

      2.4 Note.

      (a) The Loans shall be evidenced by a Note appropriately completed
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A by the Borrower.

      (b) The Note shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to the
order of the Lender, (iii) be dated as of the Closing Date, (iv) be in a stated
principal amount equal to the Commitment, (v) bear interest in accordance with
the provisions of SECTION 2.8, as the same may be applicable from time to time
to the Loans made by the Lender, and (vi) be entitled to all of the benefits of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and subject to the provisions
hereof and thereof.

      (c) The Lender will record on its internal records the amount and Type of
each Loan made by it and each payment received by it in respect thereof and
will, in the event of any transfer of its Note, either endorse on the reverse
side thereof or on a schedule attached thereto (or any continuation thereof) the
outstanding principal amount and Type of the Loans evidenced thereby as of the
date of transfer; provided, however, that the failure of the Lender to make any
such recordation or provide any such information, or any error therein, shall
not affect the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement or the Note.

      2.5 Termination of Commitment.

      (a) The Commitment shall be automatically and permanently terminated on
the Termination Date.

      (b) At any time and from time to time after the date hereof, upon not less
than five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, the Borrower may
terminate in whole or reduce in part the aggregate Unutilized Commitments,
provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of not
less than $5,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof. The amount of any termination or reduction made under this
subsection (b) may not thereafter be reinstated.

      2.6 Mandatory Payments and Prepayments.

      (a) Except to the extent due or paid sooner pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement, the aggregate outstanding principal of the Loans shall be due
and payable in full on the Maturity Date.

      (b) In the event that, at any time, the aggregate principal amount of
Loans outstanding at such time shall exceed the Commitment at such time (after
giving effect to any concurrent termination or reduction thereof), the Borrower
will immediately prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in the
amount of such excess.

      (c) Each payment or prepayment of a LIBOR Loan made pursuant to the
provisions of this Section on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto shall be made together with all amounts required under
SECTION 2.17 to be paid as a consequence thereof.


                                       16
<PAGE>
      2.7 Voluntary Prepayments. At any time and from time to time, the Borrower
shall have the right to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium
or penalty (except as provided in clause (iii) below), upon written notice given
to the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte time, three (3) Business Days
prior to each intended prepayment of LIBOR Loans and one (1) Business Day prior
to each intended prepayment of Base Rate Loans, provided that (i) each partial
prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $3,000,000
or, if greater, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (ii) no
partial prepayment of a LIBOR Loan made pursuant to any single Borrowing shall
reduce the outstanding principal amount of the remaining LIBOR Loan under such
Borrowing to less than $3,000,000 or to any greater amount not an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) unless made together with
all amounts required under SECTION 2.17 to be paid as a consequence of such
prepayment, a prepayment of a LIBOR Loan may be made only on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto. Each such notice shall specify the proposed
date of such prepayment and the aggregate principal amount and Type of the Loans
to be prepaid (and, in the case of LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period of the
Borrowing pursuant to which made), and shall be irrevocable and shall bind the
Borrower to make such prepayment on the terms specified therein. Loans prepaid
pursuant to this Section may be reborrowed, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

      2.8 Interest.

      (a) The Borrower will pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal
amount of each Loan, from the date of Borrowing thereof until such principal
amount shall be paid in full, (i) at the Base Rate, as in effect from time to
time during such periods as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, and (ii) at the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate, as in effect from time to time during such periods as such
Loan is a LIBOR Loan.

      (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any default by the
Borrower in the payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan, any fees or
other amount hereunder when due (whether at maturity, pursuant to acceleration
or otherwise), and upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other
Event of Default, all outstanding principal amounts of the Loans and, to the
greatest extent permitted by law, all interest accrued on the Loans and all
other accrued and outstanding fees and other amounts hereunder, shall, at the
option of the Lender, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the interest
applicable from time to time thereafter to such Loans (whether the Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBOR Rate) plus 2% (or, in the case of fees and other amounts, at the
Base Rate plus 2%) and, in each case, such default interest shall be payable on
demand. To the greatest extent permitted by law, interest shall continue to
accrue after the filing by or against the Borrower of any petition seeking any
relief in bankruptcy or under any law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief.

      (c) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable as follows:

            (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan (including any Base Rate Loan
      or portion thereof paid or prepaid pursuant to the provisions of SECTION
      2.6, except as provided hereinbelow), in arrears on the last Business Day
      of each calendar quarter, beginning with the first such day to occur after
      the Closing Date; provided, that in the event the Loans are repaid or
      prepaid in full and the Commitment has been terminated,


                                       17
<PAGE>
      then accrued interest in respect of all Base Rate Loans shall be payable
      together with such repayment or prepayment on the date thereof;

            (ii) in respect of each LIBOR Loan (including any LIBOR Loan or
      portion thereof paid or prepaid pursuant to the provisions of SECTION 2.6,
      except as provided hereinbelow), in arrears (y) on the last Business Day
      of the Interest Period applicable thereto (subject to the provisions of
      clause (iv) in SECTION 2.10) and (z) in addition, in the case of a LIBOR
      Loan with an Interest Period having a duration of six months or longer, on
      each date on which interest would have been payable under clause (y) above
      had successive Interest Periods of three months' duration been applicable
      to such LIBOR Loan; provided, that in the event all of the LIBOR Loan made
      pursuant to a single Borrowing is repaid or prepaid in full, then accrued
      interest in respect of such LIBOR Loan shall be payable together with such
      repayment or prepayment on the date thereof; and

            (iii) in respect of any Loan, at maturity (whether pursuant to
      acceleration or otherwise) and, after maturity, on demand.

      (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document
shall be deemed to establish or require the payment of interest to the Lender at
a rate in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. If the amount
of interest payable for the account of the Lender on any interest payment date
would exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law to be charged by the
Lender, the amount of interest payable for its account on such interest payment
date shall be automatically reduced to such maximum permissible amount. In the
event of any such reduction affecting the Lender, if from time to time
thereafter the amount of interest payable for the account of the Lender on any
interest payment date would be less than the maximum amount permitted by
applicable law to be charged by the Lender, then the amount of interest payable
for its account on such subsequent interest payment date shall be automatically
increased to such maximum permissible amount, provided that at no time shall the
aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of the Lender has been
increased pursuant to this sentence exceed the aggregate amount by which
interest paid for its account has theretofore been reduced pursuant to the
previous sentence.

      (e) The Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower upon determining the
interest rate for each Borrowing of LIBOR Loans after its receipt of the
relevant Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, and upon each
change in the Base Rate; provided, however, that the failure of the Lender to
provide the Borrower with any such notice shall not affect any obligations of
the Borrower nor result in any liability on the part of the Lender to the
Borrower. Each such determination (including each determination of the Reserve
Requirement) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all
parties hereto.

      2.9 Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender:

      (a) on the date of execution of this Agreement, the fees described in
paragraph (2) of the Fee Letter; and


                                       18
<PAGE>
      (b) a commitment fee for each calendar quarter (or portion thereof) for
the period from the date of this Agreement to the Termination Date, at a per
annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin Percentage in effect for such fee from
time to time during such quarter on the Unutilized Commitment, calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed commencing on the execution
date of this Agreement, payable in arrears (i) on the last Business Day of each
calendar quarter, beginning with the first such day to occur after the Closing
Date, and (ii) on the Termination Date.

      2.10 Interest Periods. Concurrently with the giving of a Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in respect of any Borrowing
comprised of Base Rate Loans to be converted into, or LIBOR Loans to be
continued as, LIBOR Loans, the Borrower shall have the right to elect, pursuant
to such notice, the interest period (each, an "Interest Period") to be
applicable to such LIBOR Loans, which Interest Period shall, at the option of
the applicable Borrower be a one, two, three or six-month period; provided,
however, that:

            (i) all LIBOR Loans comprising a single Borrowing shall at all times
      have the same Interest Period;

            (ii) the initial Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan shall commence
      on the date of the Borrowing of such LIBOR Loan (including the date of any
      continuation of, or conversion into, such LIBOR Loan), and each successive
      Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Loan shall commence on the day on
      which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires;

            (iii) LIBOR Loans may not be outstanding under more than four (4)
      separate Interest Periods at any one time (for which purpose Interest
      Periods shall be deemed to be separate even if they are coterminous);

            (iv) if any Interest Period otherwise would expire on a day that is
      not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
      succeeding Business Day unless such next succeeding Business Day falls in
      another calendar month, in which case such Interest Period shall expire on
      the next preceding Business Day;

            (v) the Borrower may not select any Interest Period that begins
      prior to the Closing Date or that expires after the Maturity Date;

            (vi) if any Interest Period begins on a day for which there is no
      numerically corresponding day in the calendar month during which such
      Interest Period would otherwise expire, such Interest Period shall expire
      on the last Business Day of such calendar month; and

            (vii) if, upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a
      Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the applicable Borrower shall have failed to
      elect a new Interest Period to be applicable to such LIBOR Loans, then the
      Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Loans into
      Base Rate Loans as of the expiration of the then current Interest Period
      applicable thereto.


                                       19
<PAGE>
      2.11 Conversions and Continuations.

      (a) The Borrower shall have the right, on any Business Day occurring on or
after the Closing Date, to elect (i) to convert all or a portion of the
outstanding principal amount of any Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans, or to
convert any LIBOR Loans the Interest Periods for which end on the same day into
Base Rate Loans, or (ii) upon the expiration of any Interest Period, to continue
all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Loans the
Interest Periods for which end on the same day for an additional Interest
Period, provided that (x) any such conversion of LIBOR Loans into Base Rate
Loans shall involve an aggregate principal amount of not less than $3,000,000
or, if greater, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; any such
conversion of Base Rate Loans into, or continuation of, LIBOR Loans shall
involve an aggregate principal amount of not less than $3,000,000 or, if
greater, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and no partial
conversion of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the
outstanding principal amount of such LIBOR Loans to less than $3,000,000 or to
any greater amount not an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (y)
except as otherwise provided in SECTION 2.15(D), LIBOR Loans may be converted
into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto (and, in any event, if a LIBOR Loan is converted into a Base Rate Loan
on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
the Borrower will pay, upon such conversion, all amounts required under SECTION
2.17 to be paid as a consequence thereof), and (z) no conversion of Base Rate
Loans into LIBOR Loans or continuation of LIBOR Loans shall be permitted during
the continuance of a Default or Event of Default.

      (b) The Borrower shall make each such election by giving the Lender
written notice not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte time, three (3) Business
Days prior to the intended effective date of any conversion of Base Rate Loans
into, or continuation of, LIBOR Loans and one (1) Business Day prior to the
intended effective date of any conversion of LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans.
Each such notice (each, a "Notice of Conversion/Continuation") shall be
irrevocable, shall be given in the form of EXHIBIT B-2 and shall specify (x) the
date of such conversion or continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (y) in
the case of a conversion into, or a continuation of, LIBOR Loans, the Interest
Period to be applicable thereto, and (z) the aggregate amount and Type of the
Loans being converted or continued. In the event that the Borrower shall fail to
deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation as provided herein with respect to
any outstanding LIBOR Loans, such LIBOR Loans shall automatically be converted
to Base Rate Loans upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period
applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof). In the event
the Borrower shall have failed to select in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation
the duration of the Interest Period to be applicable to any conversion into, or
continuation of, LIBOR Loans, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period with a duration of one month.

      2.12 Method of Payments; Computations.

      (a) All payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made without setoff,
counterclaim or other defense, in Dollars and in immediately available funds to
the Lender, prior to 1:00 p.m., Charlotte time, on the date payment is due. Any
payment made as required hereinabove, but after 1:00 p.m., Charlotte time, shall
be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment
falls due on a day that is not a Business Day, then


                                       20
<PAGE>
such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (except that
in the case of LIBOR Loans to which the provisions of clause (iv) in SECTION
2.10 are applicable, such due date shall be the next preceding Business Day),
and such extension of time shall then be included in the computation of payment
of interest, fees or other applicable amounts.

      (b) The Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, debit the amount of any
such payment not made as and when required hereunder to any ordinary deposit
account of the Borrower with the Lender (with prompt notice to such Borrower);
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such debit by the Lender.

      (c) All computations of interest and fees hereunder (including
computations of the Reserve Requirement) shall be made on the basis of a year
consisting of (i) in the case of interest on Base Rate Loans, 365/366 days, as
the case may be, and (ii) in all other instances, 360 days and in each case
under (i) and (ii) above, with regard to the actual number of days (including
the first day, but excluding the last day) elapsed.

      2.13 Recovery of Payments. The Borrower agrees that to the extent it makes
a payment or payments to or for the account of the Lender, which payment or
payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar state or
federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment
or repayment, the Obligation intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been received.

      2.14 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used (i) to
provide for the working capital and general corporate requirements of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries; (ii) to pay certain transaction fees and expenses
in connection with the Credit Documents in amounts acceptable to the Lender; and
(iii) to finance Permitted Acquisitions by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries.

      2.15 Increased Costs; Change in Circumstances; Illegality; etc.

      (a) If, at any time after the date hereof and from time to time, the
introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the
Lender with any guideline or request from any such Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law) given or made after the date hereof,
shall (i) subject the Lender to any tax or other charge, or change the basis of
taxation of payments to the Lender, in respect of any of its LIBOR Loans or any
other amounts payable hereunder or its obligation to make, fund or maintain any
LIBOR Loans (other than any change in the rate or basis of tax on the overall
net income of the Lender), (ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement (but excluding any reserves to the extent
actually included within the Reserve Requirement in the calculation of the LIBOR
Rate) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
by, the Lender, or (iii) impose on the Lender or its applicable Lending Office
any other condition, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase
the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loans or to reduce the
amount of any sum received or receivable by the Lender hereunder, the


                                       21
<PAGE>
Borrower will, promptly upon demand therefor by the Lender, pay to the Lender
such additional amounts as shall compensate the Lender for such increase in
costs or reduction in return.

      (b) If, at any time after the date hereof and from time to time, the
Lender shall have reasonably determined that the introduction of or any change
in any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Lender
with any guideline or request from any such Governmental Authority (whether or
not having the force of law) given or made after the date hereof, has or would
have the effect, as a consequence of the Lender's Commitment or Loans, of
reducing the rate of return on the capital of the Lender or any Person
controlling the Lender to a level below that which the Lender or controlling
Person could have achieved but for such introduction, change or compliance
(taking into account the Lender's or controlling Person's policies with respect
to capital adequacy), the Borrower will, promptly upon demand therefor by the
Lender therefor, pay to the Lender such additional amounts as will compensate
the Lender or controlling Person for such reduction in return.

      (c) If, on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, (y) the
Lender shall have determined that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the applicable LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (z) the
Lender shall have determined that the rate of interest referred to in the
definition of "LIBOR Rate" upon the basis of which the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for
LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans
during such Interest Period, the Lender will forthwith so notify the applicable
Borrower. Upon such notice, (i) all then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall
automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Periods
applicable thereto (unless then repaid in full), be converted into Base Rate
Loans, (ii) the obligation of the Lender to make, to convert Base Rate Loans
into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including pursuant to the
Borrowing to which such Interest Period applies), and (iii) any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given at any time thereafter with
respect to LIBOR Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans, in
each case until the Lender shall have determined that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist and the Lender shall have so notified
the applicable Borrower.

      (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if, at any time
after the date hereof and from time to time, the Lender shall have determined in
good faith that the introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule or
regulation or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance with any guideline or request from any such Governmental
Authority (whether or not having the force of law), has or would have the effect
of making it unlawful for the Lender to make or to continue to make or maintain
LIBOR Loans, the Lender will forthwith so notify the applicable Borrower. Upon
such notice, (i) each of the Lender's then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall
automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Period
applicable thereto (or, to the extent any such LIBOR Loan may not lawfully be
maintained as a LIBOR Loan until such expiration date, upon such notice), be
converted into a Base Rate Loan, (ii) the obligation of the Lender to make, to
convert Base Rate Loans into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended
(including pursuant to any Borrowing for which the Lender has received a Notice
of Borrowing but for which the Borrowing Date has not arrived),


                                       22
<PAGE>
and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given at
any time thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall, as to the Lender, be
deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan, in each case until the Lender shall
have determined that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer
exist and shall have so notified the applicable Borrower.

      (e) Determinations by the Lender for purposes of this Section of any
increased costs, reduction in return, market contingencies, illegality or any
other matter shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive, provided that such
determinations are made in good faith. No failure by the Lender at any time to
demand payment of any amounts payable under this Section shall constitute a
waiver of its right to demand payment of any additional amounts arising at any
subsequent time. Nothing in this Section shall require or be construed to
require the Borrower to pay any interest, fees, costs or other amounts in excess
of that permitted by applicable law.

      2.16 Taxes.

      (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under any Note shall
be made, in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
other than net income and franchise taxes imposed on the Lender by the United
States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof (all such
nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder or under the Note to the Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section),
the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower will make such deductions, (iii)
the Borrower will pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the
Borrower will deliver to the Lender evidence of such payment.

      (b) The Borrower will indemnify the Lender for the full amount of Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section) paid by the Lender and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This
indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the Lender
makes written demand therefor.

      (c) If the Lender subsequently recovers, or receives a permanent net tax
benefit with respect to, any amount of Taxes (i) previously paid by it and as to
which it has been indemnified by or on behalf of the Borrower or (ii) previously
deducted by the Borrower (including, without limitation, any Taxes deducted from
any additional sums payable under clause (i) of subsection (a) above), the
Lender shall reimburse the Borrower to the extent of the amount of any such
recovery or permanent net tax benefit (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made, or additional amounts paid, by or on behalf of the Borrower under
this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such recovery or tax
benefit); provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender,
agrees to repay to the Lender the amount paid over to

the Borrower (together with any penalties, interest or other charges), in the
event the Lender is required to repay such amount to the relevant taxing
authority or other Governmental Authority.

      2.17 Compensation. The Borrower will compensate the Lender upon demand for
all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss,
expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds required by the Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Loans)
that the Lender may incur or sustain (i) if for any reason the Borrower does not
consummate (other than due to a default by the Lender) a Borrowing or
continuation of, or conversion into, a LIBOR Loan does not occur on a date
specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, (ii) if any repayment, prepayment or conversion of any
LIBOR Loan occurs on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto (including as a consequence of acceleration of the maturity
of the Loans pursuant to SECTION 8.2), (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Loan
is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the
Borrower or (iv) as a consequence of any other failure by the Borrower to make
any payments with respect to any LIBOR Loan when due hereunder. Calculation of
all amounts payable to the Lender under this Section shall be made as though the
Lender had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase of a
Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the
amount of such LIBOR Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest
Period; provided, however, that the Lender may fund its LIBOR Loans in any
manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the
calculation of amounts payable under this Section. Determinations by the Lender
for purposes of this Section of any such losses, expenses or liabilities shall,
absent manifest error, be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made
in good faith.

      To induce the Lender to enter into this Agreement and to induce the Lender
to extend the credit contemplated hereby, the Borrower represents and warrants
to the Lender as follows:

      4.1 Corporate Organization and Power. Each of the Borrower and its
Material Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (ii)
has the full corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the
Credit Documents to which it is or will be a party, to own and hold its property
and to engage in its business as presently conducted, and (iii) is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership of its properties
requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.


                                       27
<PAGE>
      4.2 Authorization; Enforceability. The Borrower has taken, or on the
Closing Date will have taken, all necessary corporate action to execute, deliver
and perform each of the Credit Documents to which it is or will be a party, and
has, or on the Closing Date (or any later date of execution and delivery) will
have, validly executed and delivered each of the Credit Documents to which it is
or will be a party. This Agreement constitutes, and each of the other Credit
Documents upon execution and delivery will constitute, the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, by general equitable principles or by principles of good faith and
fair dealing.

      4.3 No Violation. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower
of this Agreement and each of the other Credit Documents to which it is or will
be a party, and compliance by it with the terms hereof and thereof, do not and
will not (i) violate any provision of its articles or certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or contravene any other Requirement of Law applicable to
it, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with notice, lapse
of time or both) a default under any material indenture, agreement or other
instrument to which it is a party, by which it or any of its properties is bound
or to which it is subject, (iii) result in a revocation, suspension,
termination, impairment, probation, limitation, non-renewal, forfeiture,
declaration of ineligibility, loss of status of, or loss of any other rights
(each a, "License Impairment") with respect to, any Licenses applicable to the
business, operations or properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, except
where such License Impairment would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) result in or require the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any of its properties or assets. Except for the
prohibition on Radian Reinsurance Inc. and Radian Asset Assurance Inc. making
any dividend payments to the Borrower prior to February 28, 2003 without the
consent of the New York Insurance Department, no Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement or instrument or otherwise subject to any restriction or encumbrance
that restricts or limits its ability to make dividend payments or other
distributions in respect of its Capital Stock, to repay Indebtedness owed to the
Borrower or any other Subsidiary, to make loans or advances to the Borrower or
any other Subsidiary, or to transfer any of its assets or properties to the
Borrower or any other Subsidiary, in each case other than such restrictions or
encumbrances existing under or by reason of the Credit Documents or applicable
Requirements of Law.

      4.4 Governmental and Third-Party Authorization; Permits.

      (a) No consent, approval, authorization or other action by, notice to, or
registration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or other Person is or
will be required as a condition to or otherwise in connection with the due
execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this Agreement or any of
the other Credit Documents to which it is or will be a party or the legality,
validity or enforceability hereof or thereof, other than (i) consents,
authorizations and filings that have been (or on or prior to the Closing Date
will have been) made or obtained and that are (or on the Closing Date will be)
in full force and effect, which consents, authorizations and filings are listed
on SCHEDULE 4.4 and (ii) consents and filings the failure to obtain or make
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.


                                       28
<PAGE>
      (b) The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have, and are in good standing with
respect to, all governmental approvals, Licenses, permits and authorizations
necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted and to own or lease and
operate its properties, except for those the failure to obtain which would not
be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

      4.5 Litigation. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 4.5, there are (i) no
actions, investigations, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened, at law, in equity or in arbitration, before any court,
other Governmental Authority, the Insurance Regulatory Authority or other
Person, against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective properties that would, if adversely determined, be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) no actions, investigations,
suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened,
at law, in equity or in arbitration, before any court, other Governmental
Authority, or other Person, with respect to this Agreement or any of the other
Credit Documents.

      4.6 Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all federal
tax returns, and all material state and local tax returns and reports required
to be filed by it and have paid all taxes, assessments, fees and other charges
levied upon it or upon its properties that are shown thereon as due and payable,
other than those that are being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance
with GAAP. Such returns accurately reflect in all material respects all
liability for taxes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby. There is no ongoing audit or examination or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, other investigation by any Governmental Authority of the tax liability
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and there is no unresolved claim by
any Governmental Authority concerning the tax liability of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries for any period for which tax returns have been or were
required to have been filed, other than claims for which adequate reserves have
been established in accordance with GAAP or would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.6,
neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived or extended or has
been requested to waive or extend the statute of limitations relating to the
payment of any taxes.

      4.7 Subsidiaries. SCHEDULE 4.7 sets forth a list, as of the date hereof,
of all of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower and, as to each such Subsidiary, the
percentage ownership (direct and indirect) of the Borrower in each class of its
capital stock and each direct owner thereof. Except for shares of capital stock
or other ownership interests expressly indicated on SCHEDULE 4.7, there are no
shares of capital stock, ownership interests, warrants, rights, options or other
equity securities, or other Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Borrower
outstanding or reserved for any purpose. All outstanding shares of capital stock
or ownership interests of each Subsidiary of the Borrower are duly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

      4.8 Full Disclosure. All factual information heretofore or
contemporaneously furnished to the Lender in writing by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is, and all other such
factual information hereafter furnished to the Lender in writing by or on behalf
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries when taken as a whole will be, true
and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such information
is dated or certified (or, if such


                                       29
<PAGE>
information has been amended or supplemented, on the date as of which any such
amendment or supplement is dated or certified) and not made incomplete by
omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which such information was
provided, not misleading.

      4.9 Margin Regulations. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business
of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock. No
proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, to purchase or carry
any Margin Stock, to extend credit for such purpose or for any other purpose
that would violate or be inconsistent with Regulations T, U or X or any
provision of the Exchange Act.

      4.10 No Material Adverse Change. There has been no Material Adverse Change
since December 31, 2000, and there exists no event, condition or state of facts
that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

      4.11 Financial Matters.

      (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lender copies of (i) the
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, and the related statements of income, cash
flows and stockholders' equity for the fiscal years then ended, together with
the opinion of Deloitte & Touche LLP thereon, and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of September
30, 2001, and the related statements of income, cash flows and stockholders'
equity for the nine-month period then ended. Such financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject, with respect to the unaudited
financial statements, to the absence of notes required by GAAP and to normal
year-end adjustments) and present fairly the financial condition of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
for the respective periods then ended. Except as fully reflected in the most
recent financial statements referred to above and the notes thereto, there are
no material liabilities or obligations with respect to the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not due).

      (b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, after giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) has capital sufficient
to carry on its businesses as conducted and as proposed to be conducted, (ii)
has assets with a fair saleable value, determined on a going concern basis, (y)
not less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing
debts as they become absolute and matured and (z) greater than the total amount
of its liabilities (including identified contingent liabilities, valued at the
amount that can reasonably be expected to become absolute and matured), and
(iii) does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur debts or
liabilities beyond its ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature.

      (c) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lender copies of (i) the
Annual Statements of each of its Material Insurance Subsidiaries as of December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, and for the fiscal years then ended, and (ii) the
Quarterly Statements of each of its Material Insurance Subsidiaries as of the
end of the first three fiscal quarters of 2001, and for the fiscal


                                       30
<PAGE>
quarters then ended, each as filed with the relevant Insurance Regulatory
Authority (collectively, the statements referenced in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, the "Historical Statutory Statements"). The Historical Statutory
Statements (including, without limitation, the provisions made therein for
investments and the valuation thereof, reserves, policy and contract claims and
statutory liabilities) have been prepared in accordance with SAP where required
(except as may be reflected in the notes thereto and subject, with respect to
the Quarterly Statements, to the absence of notes required by SAP and to normal
year-end adjustments), were in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Requirements of Law when filed and present fairly the financial
condition of the respective Insurance Subsidiaries covered thereby as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of operations, changes in capital and
surplus and cash flow of the respective Insurance Subsidiaries covered thereby
for the respective periods then ended. Except for liabilities and obligations
disclosed or provided for in the Historical Statutory Statements (including,
without limitation, reserves, policy and contract claims and statutory
liabilities), no Insurance Subsidiary had, as of the date of its respective
Historical Statutory Statements, any material liabilities or obligations of any
nature whatsoever (whether absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether or not
due) that, in accordance with SAP, would have been required to have been
disclosed or provided for in such Historical Statutory Statements. All books of
account of each Insurance Subsidiary fully and fairly disclose all of its
material transactions, properties, assets, investments, liabilities and
obligations, are in its possession and are true, correct and complete in all
material respects.

      (d) Within the last three (3) years, neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any "management letter" from any certified public
accountants in connection with any annual, interim or special audit that
disclosed any findings that were material and adverse to the Borrower.

      4.12 Ownership of Properties. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
(i) has good and marketable title to all real property owned by it, (ii) holds
interests as lessee under valid leases in full force and effect with respect to
all material leased real and personal property used in connection with its
business, (iii) possesses or has rights to use licenses, patents, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade names and other assets sufficient to enable it
to continue to conduct its business substantially as heretofore conducted and
without any material conflict with the rights of others, and (iv) has good title
to all of its other properties and assets reflected in the most recent financial
statements referred to in SECTION 4.11 (except as sold or otherwise disposed of
since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business), in each case under
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens.

      4.13 ERISA.

      (a) Each of the Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, and each Plan is and
has been administered in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Requirements of Law, including, without limitation, the applicable provisions of
ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. No ERISA Event (i) has occurred within the
five-year period prior to, and including, the Closing Date, or (ii) to the
knowledge of the Borrower, is reasonably expected to occur with respect to any
Plan. No Plan has any Unfunded Pension Liability as of the most recent annual
valuation date applicable


                                       31
<PAGE>
thereto, and neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a
transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

      (b) Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has had a complete or
partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, and neither the Borrower nor any
ERISA Affiliate would become subject to any liability under ERISA if the
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw completely from all
Multiemployer Plans as of the most recent valuation date. No Multiemployer Plan
is in "reorganization" or is "insolvent" within the meaning of such terms under
ERISA.

      4.14 Environmental Matters. (a) No Hazardous Substances are or have been
generated, used, located, released, treated, disposed of or stored by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, by any
other Person (including any predecessor in interest) or otherwise, in, on or
under any portion of any real property, leased or owned, of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries, except in material compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and no portion of any such real property or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, any other real property at any time leased, owned or
operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has been contaminated by any
Hazardous Substance; and no portion of any real property, leased or owned, of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has been or is presently the subject of
an environmental audit, assessment or remedial action.

      (b) No portion of any real property, leased or owned, of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries has been used by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, by any other Person, as or for a mine, a
landfill, a dump or other disposal facility, a gasoline service station, or
(other than for petroleum substances stored in the ordinary course of business)
a petroleum products storage facility; no portion of such real property or any
other real property at any time leased, owned or operated by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries has, pursuant to any Environmental Law, been placed on the
"National Priorities List" or "CERCLIS List" (or any similar federal, state or
local list) of sites subject to possible environmental problems; and there are
not and have never been, any underground storage tanks situated on any real
property, leased or owned, of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

      (c) All activities and operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with the requirements of all applicable Environmental Laws, except
to the extent the failure so to comply, individually or in the aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries has obtained all licenses and permits under Environmental
Laws necessary to its respective operations; all such licenses and permits are
being maintained in good standing; and each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
is in compliance with all terms and conditions of such licenses and permits,
except for such licenses and permits the failure to obtain, maintain or comply
with which would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
is involved in any suit, action or proceeding, or has received any notice,
complaint or other request for information from any Governmental Authority or
other Person, with respect to any actual or alleged Environmental Claims that,
if adversely determined, would be reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to the knowledge of either
Borrower, there are no threatened actions, suits, proceedings or investigations
with respect to any such Environmental Claims, nor any basis therefor.


                                       32

timely filed all material reports, documents and other materials required to be
filed by it under all applicable Requirements of Law with any Governmental
Authority and Insurance Regulatory Authority, as the case may be, has retained
all material records and documents required to be retained by it under all
applicable Requirements of Law, and is otherwise in compliance with all
applicable Requirements of Law in respect of the conduct of its business and the
ownership and operation of its properties, except for such Requirements of Law
the failure to comply with which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      4.16 Regulated Industries. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is (i) an "investment company," a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," or an "investment advisor," within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (ii) a "holding company," a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding
company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within the meaning
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

      4.17 Insurance. The assets, properties and business of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries are insured against such hazards and liabilities, under such
coverages and in such amounts, as are customarily maintained by prudent
companies similarly situated and under policies issued by insurers of recognized
responsibility.

      4.18 Material Contracts. SCHEDULE 4.18 lists, as of the Closing Date, each
"material contract" (within the meaning of 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under
the Exchange Act other than, to the extent applicable, any contract involving an
employee loan in an amount less than $60,000) that is not listed in the
Borrower's most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K or any quarterly report
filed on Form 10-Q since that time and to which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, by which any of them or their respective properties is
bound or to which any of them is subject (collectively, "Material Contracts"),
and also indicates the parties, subject matter and term thereof. As of the
Closing Date, (i) each Material Contract is in full force and effect and is
enforceable by the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary in accordance with its
terms, and (ii) neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, any other party thereto) is in breach of or default
under any Material Contract in any material respect or has given notice of
termination or cancellation of any Material Contract.

      4.19 Reinsurance Agreements. Except as set forth on Schedule F to the
Annual Statements for the Material Insurance Subsidiaries, for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2000, and except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.19, there were
no material liabilities outstanding as of September 30, 2001 under any
Reinsurance Agreement and since September 30, 2001, except as previously
disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the Lender pursuant to this Agreement,
and no Material Insurance Subsidiary has incurred any material liabilities under
any Reinsurance Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Reinsurance
Agreement (except any Reinsurance Agreement that has expired by its terms in the
ordinary course) is in full force and effect; none of the Material Insurance
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any other party thereto, is
in breach of or default under any such contract; and the Borrower has no reason
to believe that the financial condition of any other party to any such contract
is impaired such that a


                                       33
<PAGE>
default thereunder by such party could reasonably be anticipated. Each such
Reinsurance Agreement (except any Reinsurance Agreement that has expired by its
terms in the ordinary course) is qualified under all applicable Requirements of
Law to receive the statutory credit assigned to such Reinsurance Agreement in
the relevant Annual Statement or Quarterly Statement at the time prepared.

      Default shall occur as a result of the incurrence of such Indebtedness.

all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the outstanding Loans
made by it, the Note held by it); provided, however, that any such assignment
(other than an assignment to an Affiliate of the Lender) shall not be made

required in the event a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be

Lender in respect of any participation to be those set forth in the
participation agreement, and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall

      (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Lender

cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and
remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise. No failure or delay on the
part of either party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver
of any Default or Event of Default. No course of dealing between the Borrower
and the Lender or their agents or employees shall be effective to amend, modify
or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or to
constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No notice to or demand

bank regulatory authority, court, other Governmental Authority or Insurance
Regulatory Authority having or asserting jurisdiction over the Lender, as may be

reasonably possible, the Borrower is provided with timely notice of such demand
or request so that the Borrower may seek an appropriate protective order with
the reasonable cooperation of the Lender (at the Borrower's expense)), (iii) in
connection with any proceeding to enforce its rights hereunder or under any

which it is a party, (iv) to the extent the same has become publicly available

                                   LITIGATION

      IN DECEMBER 2000, A COMPLAINT SEEKING CLASS ACTION STATUS ON BEHALF OF A
NATIONWIDE CLASS OF HOME MORTGAGE BORROWERS WAS FILED AGAINST RADIAN GUARANTY
INC. IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF NORTH
CAROLINA (GREENSBORO DIVISION). THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT RADIAN GUARANTY INC.
VIOLATED SECTION 8 OF RESPA. THE COMPLAINT ASSERTS THAT THE PRICING OF POOL
INSURANCE, CAPTIVE REINSURANCE CONTRACT UNDERWRITING, PERFORMANCE NOTES AND
OTHER UNIDENTIFIED STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS, SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS IMPUTED
KICKBACKS MADE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REFERRAL OF PRIMARY MORTGAGE INSURANCE
BUSINESS, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINT, IS A SETTLEMENT SERVICE UNDER RESPA.
THE COMPLAINT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES OF 3X THE AMOUNT OF ANY
MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUMS PAID BY PERSONS WHO WERE REFERRED TO RADIAN GUARANTY
INC. TO THE ALLEGED AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE LAWSUIT
ARE REPRESENTED BY THE SAME GROUP OF PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEYS WHO FILED SIMILAR
LAWSUITS AGAINST OTHER PROVIDERS OF PRIMARY MORTGAGE INSURANCE IN FEDERAL COURT
IN GEORGIA. THE GEORGIA COURT DISMISSED THOSE SUITS FOR A FAILURE TO STATE A
CLAIM. THREE OF THOSE LAWSUITS WERE SETTLED PRIOR TO APPEAL; TWO ARE CURRENTLY
ON APPEAL. RADIAN GUARANTY HAS RESPONDED TO THE COMPLAINT BY FILING A MOTION TO
DISMISS.

      A SIMILAR ACTION FOCUSING ON POOL INSURANCE WAS FILED IN FEBRUARY 2001 IN
THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
