                        Borrowing Subsidiaries from time to time party hereto,
                        the LENDERS party hereto, FLEET NATIONAL BANK, as
                        Documentation Agent, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON, as
                        Syndication Agent, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., BANK ONE, NA
                        and SUN TRUST BANK as Co-Agents and CHASE BANK OF TEXAS,
                        NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Administrative Agent,
                        Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank.

            Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (such term and each other
capitalized term used but not defined herein having the meaning given to it in
Article I), the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Avex Entities. In connection with the Acquisition, on the
Effective Date of the Original Credit Agreement (a) the Company borrowed the
Term Loans and a principal amount not to exceed $75,000,000 of the Revolving
Loans, (b) the Company received the proceeds of not less than $80,200,000
aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Notes and (c) the Company
refinanced the Scheduled Indebtedness.

            Under the Original Credit Agreement, the Lenders agreed to extend
credit in the form of (a) Term Loans on the Effective Date in an aggregate
principal amount not in excess of $100,000,000 and (b) Revolving Loans at any
time and from time to time on or after the Effective Date and prior to the
Revolving Maturity Date in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding
not in excess of $125,000,000 minus the LC Exposure at such time, and the
Issuing Banks agreed to issue Letters of Credit in an aggregate stated amount at
any time outstanding that would not result in the LC Exposure exceeding
$20,000,000. The proceeds of the Term Loans and of Revolving Loans made on the
Effective Date were to be used by the Company solely (i) to finance the
Acquisition, (ii) to refinance the Scheduled Indebtedness and (iii) to pay fees
and expenses related to the Effective Date Transactions. The proceeds of the
remaining Revolving Loans were to be used by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes. The Letters of
Credit were to be used to support obligations incurred by the Company and the
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their businesses.

            The Company has requested that the Original Credit Agreement be
amended and restated to, among other things, increase the Revolving Commitments
to $175,000,000 on the Restatement Effective Date and amend certain covenants as
set forth herein. The proceeds of Loans made under the increased Revolving
Commitments, and Letters of Credit issued pursuant thereto, will be used for the
same purposes as the Loans made and the Letters of Credit issued under the
Revolving Commitments as originally in effect.

            The parties hereto agree as follows:

Borrowing, and at the time that any ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall

2.04(e). Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the
same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of
five Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Revolving Maturity Date or Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable or if the
requested Interest Period with respect to any Term Loan or portion thereof would
extend beyond any date upon which is due any scheduled principal payment in
respect of Term Loans unless the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans which
are ABR Loans or which are Eurodollar Loans having Interest Periods that will
expire on or before such date equals or exceeds the amount of such principal
payment.

            SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. To request a Revolving

acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Issuing Bank, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank
and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e)
of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the
Company for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

            (e) Reimbursement. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice. If the
Company fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall
notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then
due from the Company in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage
thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then
due from the Company, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with
respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the
amounts so

                                                                              46


received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph,
the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Bank or,
to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement
shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its obligation
to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

            (f) Obligations Absolute. The Company's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Company's obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any
Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the
Company that are caused by any Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, each
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

            (g) Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the

<PAGE>
                                                                              47


Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that
any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company
of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with
respect to any such LC Disbursement.

            (h) Interim Interest. If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Company reimburses such LC Disbursement,
at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if
the Company fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest
accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank,
except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving
Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank
shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

            (i) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced
at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent,
the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At
the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all
unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

            (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such
date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation
to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the
Company described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. The Company also shall
deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required
by Section 2.10(b) and (c), and any such cash collateral so deposited and held
by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall constitute part of the Borrowing
Base for purposes of determining compliance with Section 2.10(b) and (c). Each
such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the
payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.
The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including
the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such

<PAGE>
                                                                              48


account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits,
which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the Company's risk and expense, such deposits shall
not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for
which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be
held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for
the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure
representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy
other obligations of the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all
Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Company is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b), such
amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company
as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the Company would
remain in compliance with Section 2.10(b) and no Default shall have occurred and
be continuing.

            SECTION 2.05. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available
to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in
like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative
Agent in New York City and designated by such Borrower in the applicable
Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

            (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Lender prior to any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In
such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable
Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and
the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of
such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such
Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.06. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and
Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an
initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the
applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different

<PAGE>
                                                                              49


Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The
Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the
affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans
comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

            (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by
the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the
Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic
Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly
by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
the applicable Borrower.

            (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and paragraph
(f) of this Section:

            (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
      and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
      portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
      Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
      clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
      Borrowing);

            (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
      Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

            (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
      Eurodollar Borrowing; and

            (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
      Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
      election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
      term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

            (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

            (e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long
as an Event of Default is

<PAGE>
                                                                              50


continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a
Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.

            SECTION 2.07. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, (i) the Term Loan Commitments shall permanently terminate
at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Effective Date and (ii) the Revolving
Commitments and the Foreign Borrower Commitments shall permanently terminate on
the Revolving Maturity Date.

            (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Revolving Commitments or any Foreign Borrower Commitment; provided
that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that
is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate
or reduce the Revolving Commitments or any Foreign Borrower Commitment if, after
giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance
with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total
Revolving Commitments.

            (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section, at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of
termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Company may state that
such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments
shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Revolving Commitments.

            SECTION 2.08. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date and (ii) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.09.

            (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

<PAGE>
                                                                              51


            (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall
prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the
order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its
registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and the
Company. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest
thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04)
be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order
of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to
such payee and its registered assigns).

            SECTION 2.09. Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject to adjustment
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Company shall repay the Term
Borrowings in 20 consecutive quarterly installments, payable on December 31,
1999 and on each Quarterly Date thereafter, in the quarterly and annual
aggregate principal amounts set forth opposite the applicable period listed
below:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Period            Quarterly Payment            Annual Amount
        ------            -----------------            -------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         2002                 5,000,000                 20,000,000

         2004                 7,000,000                 21,000,000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            (b) To the extent not previously paid, all Term Loans shall be due
and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

            (c) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing shall be applied to reduce
the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Borrowings to be made pursuant
to this Section ratably; provided that any prepayment made pursuant to Section
2.10(a) shall be applied first, to reduce the next scheduled repayment of the
Term Borrowings to be made pursuant to this Section unless and until such next
scheduled repayment has been eliminated as a result of reductions hereunder and
second, ratably.

<PAGE>
                                                                              52


            (d) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings hereunder, the
Company shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid and shall notify
the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the
scheduled date of such repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied
ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term
Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.

            SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000, subject
to the requirements of this Section.

            (b) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the Revolving
Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Commitments, the Borrowers shall prepay
Revolving Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash
collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
2.04(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

            (c) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Term Loans and the aggregate Revolving
Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrowers shall prepay Borrowings (or,
if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account
with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(j)) in an aggregate
amount equal to such excess.

            (d) In the event and on each occasion that any Proceeds are received
by the Company, the Company shall, immediately after such Proceeds are received,
apply such Proceeds to prepay Term Loans until the Term Loans have been paid in
full.

            (e) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory
prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment;
provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a
conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated
by Section 2.07, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of
termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07. Promptly following
receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000, except as necessary
to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of
a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid
Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent
required by Section 2.12.

            SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which
shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of the
Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the

<PAGE>
                                                                              53


period from and including the date of this Agreement to but excluding the date
on which such Revolving Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees in
respect of the Revolving Commitments shall be payable in arrears on the last day
of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
commitment fees with respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of
a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving
Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender.

            (b) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participation in each Letter of Credit, which shall accrue at a per annum rate
equal to the Applicable Rate used to compute interest on Eurodollar Revolving
Loans on the average daily amount of the portion of such Lender's LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
attributable to such Letter of Credit during the period from and including the
date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to but excluding the date on which
such Letter of Credit expires or is drawn in full (but which shall in no event
be less than $500 for the period from and including the date of issuance thereof
to but excluding the date on which it expires or is drawn in full), and (ii) to
each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per
annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion
thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from
and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to
be any LC Exposure, as well as each Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to
the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued
through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of
each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day,
commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within
10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed
on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

            (c) The Company agrees to pay (or to cause the applicable Foreign
Borrower to pay) (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Revolving Lender a participation fee (an "Foreign Borrower Participation Fee")
with respect to its obligation under Section 2.01(c) to acquire participations
in Revolving Loans, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine
the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average
daily amount of such Revolving Lender's Foreign Borrower Exposure (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to Revolving Loans in respect of which such Lender
has made, or is required to have made, payments to the applicable Fronting
Lenders as provided in Section 2.01(d)) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's
Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have
any Foreign Borrower Exposure, and (ii) to each Fronting Lender a fronting fee
(an "Foreign Borrower Fronting Fee"), which shall accrue at the rate of .125%
per annum on the daily aggregate

                                                                              54


outstanding amount of the Revolving Loans made by such Fronting Lender under
Section 2.01(b) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and
the date on which there cease to be any Revolving Loans outstanding. Foreign
Borrower Participation Fees and Foreign Borrower Fronting Fees accrued under
this paragraph through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such Fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and any such Fees accruing after the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All Foreign Borrower
Participation Fees and Foreign Borrower Fronting Fees payable under this
paragraph shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

            (d) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Company and the Administrative Agent.

            (e) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of each Lender who executes and delivers to the Administrative Agent a
signature page to this amendment and restatement by June 23, 2000, an amendment
fee equal to 0.10% of the outstanding Loans, LC Exposure and unused Commitments
of such Lender prior to the Restatement Effective Date.

            (f) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to any Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

            SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (except
that the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing made pursuant to Section 2.01(b)
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate).

            (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate (except that the Loans comprising each
Eurodollar Borrowing made pursuant to Section 2.01(b) shall bear interest at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing).

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

                                                                              55


            (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans,
upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving
Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid
shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current
Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the
effective date of such conversion.

            (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

            (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
      be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
      not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest
      Period; or

            (b) the Administrative Agent determines that the Adjusted LIBO Rate
      for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost
      to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such
      Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

            (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
      or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
      of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
      reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or

            (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank
      market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans
      made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

<PAGE>
                                                                              56


and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Company will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

            (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by,
such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level
below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing
Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of
such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company
for any such reduction suffered.

            (c) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days
after receipt thereof.

            (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that
the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more
than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.

            SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be
revoked under Section 2.10(e) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the
purchase of participations in any Revolving Loan pursuant to

<PAGE>
                                                                              57


Section 2.01(c), or (e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by
the applicable Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the
applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the
amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period
at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and
period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender
setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such
Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

            SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes; provided that if any Loan Party shall be required to deduct any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, the Company shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (c) The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Company by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

            (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental

<PAGE>
                                                                              58


Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment
or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

            (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender
has received written notice from the Borrower advising it of the availability of
such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.

            SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14,
2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or
under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time), on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and
payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified
therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by
it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due
on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

            (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed
LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

            (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans (other than Revolving Loans made pursuant
to Section 2.01(b)), Term Loans, participations in LC Disbursements or in
participations in Revolving Loans made by Fronting Lenders resulting in such
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its
Revolving Loans

<PAGE>
                                                                              59


(other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to Section 2.01(b)), Term Loans,
participations in LC Disbursements or in participations in Revolving Loans made
by Fronting Lenders and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by
any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans (other
than Revolving Loans made pursuant to Section 2.01(b)), Term Loans,
participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders or in participations in
Revolving Loans made by Fronting Lenders to the extent necessary so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans (other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to
Section 2.01(b)), Term Loans, participations in LC Disbursements or in
participations in Revolving Loans made by Fronting Lenders; provided that (i) if
any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms
of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

            (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that such
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing
Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has
not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as
the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation.

            (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

            SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if a Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations

<PAGE>
                                                                              60


hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

            (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if a
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment
of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations
in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the
case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a material
reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to
make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a
waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

            SECTION 2.19. Borrowing Subsidiaries. On or after the Effective
Date, the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as a
Borrowing Subsidiary by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing
Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Restricted Subsidiary and the Company, and
upon such delivery such Restricted Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this
Agreement be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement until the
Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a
Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary,
whereupon such Restricted Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary
and a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no
Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Borrowing
Subsidiary at a time when any principal of or interest on any Revolving Loan to
such Borrowing Subsidiary or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such
Borrowing Subsidiary shall be outstanding hereunder; provided that such
Borrowing Subsidiary Termination shall be effective to terminate such Borrowing
Subsidiary's right to make further Borrowings or to request Letters of Credit
under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrowing
Subsidiary Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each
Lender.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

              Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders:

            SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

            SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required,
stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Borrowers and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party
is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrowers or such Loan
Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

            SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions
(a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or
any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) such as have been

applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any
indenture, material agreement or other material instrument binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right
thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except Liens created
under the Loan Documents.

audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements
referred to in clause (ii) above.

            (b) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred to

            SECTION 3.05. Properties. (a) Each of the Company and its

and personal property material to its business (including its Mortgaged
Properties), except for minor defects in title that (i) do not interfere with

Effect.

            (b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual
property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Company and its

any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            (c) Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property that
is owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Date after giving effect to the Transactions.

            (c) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in

            SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all
indentures, material agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its
property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No
Default has occurred and is continuing.

            SECTION 3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined
in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a
"holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

            SECTION 3.09. Taxes. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have
been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been

appropriate proceedings and for which the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $5,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $15,000,000 the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information
Memorandum nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or
other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, taken as a whole, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to
projected financial information, the Borrowers represent only that such
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time.

            SECTION 3.12. Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name of,
and the ownership interest of the Company in, each Subsidiary of the Company and
identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each case as of
the Effective Date.

            SECTION 3.13. Insurance. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a description of
all insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, all premiums in respect of such
insurance have been paid. The Company believes that the insurance maintained by
or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries is adequate.

            SECTION 3.14. Labor Matters. As of the Effective Date, there are no
strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Company or any Subsidiary pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. The hours worked by and payments
made to employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation
of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or
foreign law dealing with such matters. All payments due from the Company or any
Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Company or any
Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and
other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the
Company or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions will not give
rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any
union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is bound.

            SECTION 3.15. Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions to occur on the Effective Date and immediately following the making
of each Loan made on the Effective Date and after giving effect to the
application of the proceeds of such Loans, (a) the fair value of the assets of
each Loan Party, at a fair valuation, will exceed its debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of
the property of each Loan Party will be greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party will be able to pay its debts
and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) each Loan Party will not have
unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which it is
engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted
following the Effective Date.

            SECTION 3.16. Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations will constitute
Senior Debt under and as defined in the Subordinated Note Indenture.

            SECTION 3.17. Year 2000. Any reprogramming required to permit the
proper functioning, in and following the year 2000, of (a) the computer systems
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) equipment containing embedded
microchips (including systems and equipment supplied by others or with which the
Company's systems interface) and the testing of all such systems and equipment,
as so reprogrammed, will be completed by September 30, 1999, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The cost to the Company and its
Subsidiaries of such reprogramming and testing and of the reasonably foreseeable
consequences of year 2000 to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
reprogramming errors and the failure of others'

<PAGE>
                                                                              65


systems or equipment) will not result in a Default or a Material Adverse Effect.
Except for such of the reprogramming referred to in the preceding sentence as
may be necessary, the computer and management information systems of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are and, with ordinary course upgrading and maintenance,
will continue for the term of this Agreement to be, sufficient to permit the
Company to conduct its businesses without Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.18. Intellectual Property. The Company and each of its
Subsidiary owns, or is licensed to use, all patents, trademarks, tradenames,
service marks, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes (together with all
applications therefor and licenses granting rights therein, "Intellectual
Property") reasonably necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted, except for those the failure to own or be licensed to use which could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, (a) the use of Intellectual Property by the Company
and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any person, (b) no
Intellectual Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is being
infringed upon by any Person, and (c) no claim is pending or threatened in
writing challenging the use or the validity of any Intellectual Property of the
Company or any Subsidiary, except for infringements and claims referred to in
the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) that, in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            The representations and warranties made by the Borrowers on the
Effective Date under the Original Credit Agreement shall survive for all
purposes regardless of the changes effected by this amendment and restatement.

            SECTION 5.05. Payment of Obligations. The Company will, and will

cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep and maintain all property material to
the conduct of its business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear

reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested.

            (b) The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
permit any representatives designated by the Administrative Agent (including any
consultants, accountants, lawyers and appraisers retained by the Administrative
Agent) to conduct evaluations and appraisals of the Company's computation of the
Borrowing Base and the assets included in the Borrowing Base, all at such
reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested; provided that, if no
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no more than one such evaluation
will be requested by the Administrative Agent during any fiscal year. The
Company agrees that an evaluation of the Borrowing Base will be initiated by the
Administrative Agent within six weeks of the Restatement Effective Date. The
Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any representatives
retained by the Administrative Agent to conduct any such evaluation or
appraisal. The Company also agrees to modify or adjust the computation of the
Borrowing Base (which may include maintaining additional reserves or changing
the definitions of or modifying the eligibility criteria for the components of
the Borrowing Base) to the extent required by the Administrative Agent or the
Required Lenders as a result of any such evaluation or appraisal, in each case
with the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

            SECTION 5.09. Compliance with Laws. The Company will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders
of any Governmental Authority (including Environmental Laws) applicable to it or

Effect.

            SECTION 5.10. Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit. The proceeds of
the Borrowings hereunder will be used only for the purposes set forth in the
preamble to this Agreement. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used,
whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any
of the Regulations of the Board, including Regulations U and X.

            SECTION 5.11. Additional Subsidiaries. If any additional Subsidiary
is formed or acquired after the Effective Date, the Company will, at least five
Business Days before such Subsidiary is formed or acquired, notify the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof and cause the Collateral and
Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied (to the extent applicable) with respect to
such Subsidiary and with respect to any Equity Interest in or Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary owned or to be owned by or on behalf of the Company or any other
Subsidiary.

            SECTION 5.12. Further Assurances. The Company will, and will cause
each Subsidiary to, execute any and all further documents, financing statements,
agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the
filing and recording of financing

<PAGE>

statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents),
which may be required under any applicable law, or which the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably request, to cause the Collateral
and Guarantee Requirement to be and remain satisfied, all at the expense of the
Loan Parties. The Company also agrees to provide to the Administrative Agent
from time to time upon request evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent as to the perfection and priority of the Liens created or
intended to be created by the Security Documents.

            SECTION 5.13. Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Rate Protection.
As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 60 days after the Effective
Date, the Company will enter into, and thereafter for a period of not less than
four years will maintain in effect, one or more interest rate protection
agreements on such terms and with such parties as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the effect of which shall be to fix or
limit the interest cost to the Company with respect to at least 50% of the Term
Loans outstanding from time to time. The Company will also identify currency
exchange rate risks to which the Company and the Subsidiaries are subject from
time to time and enter into one or more exchange rate protection agreements, on
such terms and with such parties as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, to limit such risks. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event the Company shall use the proceeds of any Borrowing hereunder to make
a loan or advance to any Foreign Subsidiary, such loan or advance will be
denominated in the currency of the jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary has its
principal operations and the Company will enter into one or more exchange rate
protection agreements, on such terms and with such parties as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to limit the exchange rate
risk to the Company associated with such loan or advance.

            SECTION 5.14. Ownership of Subsidiaries. (a) The Company will, and
will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, ensure that all Equity Interests in
Domestic Subsidiaries are owned directly or indirectly at all times only by the
Company or one or more other Domestic Subsidiaries and that all the Equity
Interests of such latter Domestic Subsidiaries are pledged to secure the
Obligations.

            (b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30 days
after the Effective Date, the Company will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, ensure that any Foreign Subsidiary (including each Foreign
Subsidiary acquired in connection with the Acquisition), is owned directly or
indirectly at all times by a Qualified Foreign Subsidiary Holding Company and
that all the Equity Interests of such Qualified Foreign Subsidiary Holding
Company are pledged to secure the Obligations.

                            The Administrative Agent

            Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

            The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have
the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such
bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally
engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

            The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any
of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable
for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of
the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative
Agent shall not be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a
Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation
made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection
therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or
any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV

or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items
expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

            The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal
counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other
experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or
experts.

            The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

            Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

            Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not

Syndication Agent nor any Co-Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities
under this Agreement.

right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of

                                                                              86


any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any
provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled payment of the
principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.09, or the required date of
reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any
interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any
such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section
2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of
the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of
"Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive,
amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any
consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender
of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release all or substantially all the
Guarantors from their Guarantees under the Guarantee Agreement except as
expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement or Section 9.14, or limit the
liability of the Guarantors in respect of their Guarantee, without the written
consent of each Lender or (vii) release all or substantially all the Collateral
from the Liens of the Security Documents without the written consent of each
Lender; provided further that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or
otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing
Bank without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification
of this Agreement that by its terms reduces or adversely affects the rights or
duties under this Agreement of the Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of one
or more Classes without affecting the rights or duties of the Lenders holding
Loans or Commitments of the other Class or Classes may be effected by an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the
percentage in interest of each adversely affected Class of Lenders that would be
required to consent thereto under this Section if such Class of Lenders were the
only Class of Lenders at such time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision
of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the
Company, the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights
or obligations are affected thereby the Issuing Banks) if (i) by the terms of
such agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the

<PAGE>
                                                                              87


amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such
amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not
consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and interest
accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for
its account under this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Company
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and such Affiliates,
in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein,
the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection
with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or, after the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Default, any Lender, including the fees, charges
and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank
or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or
in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder,
including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

            (b) The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any
Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand
for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property currently or formerly
owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

            (c) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank under paragraph
(a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be,

<PAGE>
                                                                              88


such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank in its capacity as such. For
purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its
share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and
unused Commitments at the time.

            (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

            (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

            SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that a
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing
Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

            (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i)
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender,
each of the Company and the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an
assignment of all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or any Lender's
obligations in respect of its LC Exposure, such Issuing Bank) must give their
prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or
an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of
the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date
the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to
the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the
Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) the parties
to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that
any consent of the Company otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be
required if an Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has
occurred and is continuing. Subject

<PAGE>
                                                                              89


to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section,
from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance
the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of
this Section.

            (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of Houston a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register
shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

            (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

            (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Company, the
Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that (i) such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the
first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant and (ii) in the
case of a Lender

<PAGE>
                                                                              90


selling a participation to a wholly owned subsidiary of such Lender, such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Participant shall also have the
right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the
Loan Documents . Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrowers agree
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15
and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08
as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.

            (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless
the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section
2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

            (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

            (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender ") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an
"SPC "), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender
to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, the option to provide to a
Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise
be obligated to make to a Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)
nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and
(ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make
such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder
shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as
if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees
that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation
under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting
Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which
agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the
date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding
commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute
against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.04, any SPC
may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrowers
and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefore,
assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or
to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrowers and Administrative
Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such
SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a

<PAGE>
                                                                              91


confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any
rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or
credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

            SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of
Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination
of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

            SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letters dated July 21, 1999, and June 2,
2000, among Chase Securities Inc., Chase and the Company constitute the entire
contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement
shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Company, each
Borrowing Subsidiary and the Administrative Agent, and when the Administrative
Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear
the signatures of the Required Lenders, and thereafter shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

            SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any
Borrower

<PAGE>
                                                                              92


against any of and all the obligations of any Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

            SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.

            (b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and
each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such
Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to
bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

            (c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

            (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

            SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

            SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
applicable Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood
that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any
assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of
the Company or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis from a source other than the Company. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from the Company relating to the
Company or its business, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Company; provided that, in the case of
information received from the Company after the Effective Date, such information
is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person
required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this
Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if
such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

            SECTION 9.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

            SECTION 9.14. Release of Liens and Guarantees. In the event that the
Company or any Subsidiary sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or any
portion of any of the Equity Interests, assets or property owned by the Company
or such Subsidiary in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall promptly (and the Lenders
hereby authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
to) take such action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably
requested by the Company and at the Borrower's expense to release any Liens
created by any Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests, assets or
property, including the release and satisfaction of record of any mortgage or
deed of trust granted in connection herewith, and, in the case of a disposition
of all or substantially all the Equity Interests or assets of any Subsidiary
that is a Loan Party, terminate such Subsidiary's obligations under the
Guarantee Agreement and each other Loan Document. In addition, the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent agree to take such actions as are
reasonably requested by the Company and at the Borrower's expense to terminate
the Liens and security interests created by the Loan Documents when all the
Obligations have been paid in full and all Letters of Credit and Commitments
terminated.

            SECTION 9.15. No Novation. The execution, delivery and effectiveness
of this Agreement shall not extinguish the obligations for the payment of money
outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement or discharge or release the Lien
or priority of any Collateral Document or any other security therefor. Nothing
herein contained shall be construed as a substitution or novation of the
obligations outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement or any agreements
securing the same, which shall remain in full force and effect, except as
modified hereby or by agreements executed concurrently herewith. Nothing
expressed or implied in this Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby
shall be construed as a release or other discharge of Company under the Original
Credit Agreement or any Guarantor under any Loan Document from any of its
obligations and liabilities thereunder. Each of the Original Credit Agreement
and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect until and
except as expressly modified hereby.
