Lender&#146;s default), Borrower shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs payable to the potential
investor and other reasonable costs, fees and damages incurred by Lender in connection with its
failure to fulfill the MBS Commitment or Fannie Mae Commitment. Lender reserves the right to

converted in accordance with this subsection 1.05(e)(ii) shall require amortization calculated over
the Amortization Period. No Collateral may be released from the Collateral Pool, upon the maturity
dates of any Loan made under this Agreement, unless the requirements of Sections&nbsp;3.04 and 6.05 are

Variable Loan set forth in the Conversion Request cannot be converted because the increased debt
service on the Fixed Loan does not result in the Collateral Pool satisfying the Coverage and LTV
Tests, Borrower shall prepay the amount of the Variable Loan that cannot be converted to a Fixed

market or property conditions warrant, Lender shall redetermine Allocable Loan Amounts and
Valuations. Lender shall also redetermine Allocable Loan Amounts to take account of any
substitution or release of Collateral or a conversion of interest rate or other event that
invalidates the outstanding determinations. In determining Valuations, Lender shall use
Capitalization Rates based on its internal survey and analysis of capitalization rates for
comparable sales in the vicinity of the Mortgaged Property, with such adjustments as Lender deems
appropriate and without any obligation to use any information provided by Borrower. If Lender is
unable to determine a Capitalization Rate for a Mortgaged Property, Lender shall have the right,
with the prior consent of Borrower, not more than once annually, to obtain, at Borrower&#146;s expense,
a market study in order to establish a Capitalization Rate. In the event Borrower fails to consent
to Lender obtaining a market study, Lender shall determine the Capitalization Rate pursuant to the
Underwriting Requirements. Lender shall promptly disclose its determinations to Borrower. Until
redetermined, the outstanding Allocable Loan Amounts

contrary, no change in Allocable Loan Amounts, Valuations, the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio or the

Mortgaged Property to be released, at a closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a
Closing Date selected by Lender, and occurring within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Lender&#146;s receipt of
the Release Request (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree), by executing and

the Release Mortgaged Property and (ii)&nbsp;one hundred percent (100%) of the amount, if any, of the

Value Ratio and a higher Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio): (1)&nbsp;the Aggregate Debt Service
Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio immediately prior to the release or (2)&nbsp;the
Coverage and LTV Test. In addition to the Release Price, Borrower shall pay to Lender all
associated prepayment premiums and other amounts due under the Notes being repaid. In connection
with a non-simultaneous substitution of Collateral pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.06(c)(ii)</U> of this

under the applicable note, until any variable rate
Supplemental Loan is no longer Outstanding, then against any Variable Loan Outstanding so long

determined by Fannie Mae pursuant to this Agreement.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">We have acted as NATIONALITY counsel to the Bank acting by and through its NEW YORK BRANCH in
connection with the preparation, execution and delivery by the Bank of the Letter of Credit. We
have examined the Letter of Credit and such other instruments, corporate records, certificates,
documents and other matters as we have deemed necessary or advisable in order to give the following
opinions. In giving this opinion, we have assumed the genuineness of signatures and the
authenticity of certificates and documents, other than those of the Bank, submitted to us as
originals and the conformity to original documents of documents submitted to us as copies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">As to various questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon information
provided to us by officers of the Bank and documents issued by governmental bodies and officials.
We have also assumed the Letter of Credit is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
the Bank under the laws of the STATE OF NEW YORK and the United States of America.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">No opinion is expressed herein as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of
COUNTRY.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-left: 8%">Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">1.&nbsp;The Bank is duly established, validly existing and in good standing in COUNTRY and has the
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Letter of
Credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">2.&nbsp;The Bank&#146;s execution and delivery of, and performance of its obligations under, the Letter
of Credit have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Bank.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">3.&nbsp;The Bank&#146;s execution and performance of the Letter of Credit will not violate any
NATIONALITY law, rule or regulation pertaining to the Bank, including its NEW YORK BRANCH, any
NATIONALITY court order or government order, or any charter or bylaw provision or agreement of the
Bank. No consent, approval, authorization, license, ruling or order of, or action by, any
NATIONALITY court or governmental agency or body not previously obtained, and no filing,
recordation or publication of any document not previously filed, recorded or published, is required
under the laws of COUNTRY currently in effect in connection with the execution and delivery by the
Bank of the Letter of Credit, or for the remittance from COUNTRY to the United States of United
States dollars in an amount sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the Bank under the Letter of
Credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">4.&nbsp;The Letter of Credit, assuming it has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized
representative of the NEW YORK BRANCH of the Bank, enforceable in accordance with its terms under
the laws of the STATE OF NEW YORK to which it is expressly subject, will constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Bank ranking pari passu with the Bank&#146;s other unsecured,
unsubordinated indebtedness (including deposit liabilities but except those preferred by law),
enforceable in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that enforcement of the Letter of
Credit against the Bank may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation,
moratorium or other similar proceedings or laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146; rights in
general as such laws would apply in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
liquidation of the Bank.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">5.&nbsp;In the event that the Bank fails to honor its obligations under the Letter of Credit (other
than as a result of compliance with the applicable laws, regulations, directives or orders of
appropriate governmental authority of the United States) upon proper demand to the NEW YORK BRANCH
in compliance with the requirements of the Letter of Credit, the Bank would have a direct and
general obligation to make payment in accordance with the Letter of Credit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">6. The beneficiary of the Letter of Credit would be able to institute any actions or
proceedings directly against the Bank in CITY, COUNTRY under the Letter of Credit without first
having to obtain a judgment in respect of the Letter of Credit in a court in the United States, and
access by the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit to the courts of COUNTRY is not restricted. The
beneficiary of the Letter of Credit is not required to qualify under any statute or law or pay any
franchise tax, stamp tax or similar fee to gain such access, whether in respect of a direct suit on
the Letter of Credit, or a proceeding to enforce a judgment obtained by the Trustee before a court
in the United States, nor will the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit be resident, domiciled,
carrying on business or otherwise subject to taxation in COUNTRY solely by reason of the execution,
delivery, or performance by the Bank or the enforcement by the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit.
Any final and conclusive judgment for a definite sum obtained for the recovery of amounts due and
unpaid under the Letter of Credit in a NEW YORK STATE or United States Federal court sitting in NEW
YORK will be held enforceable against the Bank in the appropriate courts of COUNTRY without
re-examination or re-litigation of the
matters adjudicated. STATE CUSTOMARY EXCEPTION(S) TO THE ABOVE PROVISIONS, IF ANY.
