     2.13.    NOTELESS AGREEMENT; EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS. (a) Each Lender
shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each
Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

              (b)  The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will
     record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
     Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
     interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to
     each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent
     hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

              (c)  The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant
     to PARAGRAPHS (a) and (b) above shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the
     existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that the failure of the Agent or any

                                      -16-
<Page>

     Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any
     manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in
     accordance with their terms.

              (d)  Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a
     promissory note in substantially the form of EXHIBIT A (including any
     amendment, modification, renewal or replacement thereof, a "NOTE"). In such
     event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such
     Note payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
     by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any
     assignment pursuant to SECTION 12.3) be represented by one or more Notes
     payable to the order of the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to
     SECTION 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee
     subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such
     Loans once again be evidenced as described in PARAGRAPHS (a) and (b) above.
     Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of any Lender as to the loss,
     theft, destruction or mutilation of such Lender's Note, and, in the case of
     any such loss, theft destruction or mutilation, upon cancellation of such
     Note, the Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note in the
     same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.

     2.14.    TELEPHONIC NOTICES. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and
the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of
Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or
persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of
the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is
specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation
Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent
or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the
written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

     2.15.    INTEREST PAYMENT DATES; INTEREST AND FEE BASIS. Interest accrued
on each Alternate Base Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date
on which an Alternate Base Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration
or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the
outstanding principal amount of any Alternate Base Rate Advance converted into a
Eurodollar Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the
date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable
on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the
Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period
longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each
three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest with respect to
Eurodollar Loans, facility fees, utilization fees and term out fees shall be
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest with
respect to Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be calculated for the actual days
elapsed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as applicable. Interest shall be
payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the
amount paid if

                                      -17-
<Page>

payment is made in full and received prior to noon (Chicago time) at the place
of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall
become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such
extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with
such payment.

     2.16.    NOTIFICATION OF ADVANCES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENTS AND
COMMITMENT REDUCTIONS. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice,
Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received
by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the Eurodollar Rate
applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such
interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the
Alternate Base Rate.

     2.17.    LENDING INSTALLATIONS. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be
deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.
Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance
with ARTICLE XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations
through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are
to be made.

     2.18.    NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE AGENT. Unless the Borrower or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan, or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three (3) days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

     2.19.    EXTENSION OF REVOLVING CREDIT TERMINATION DATE AND FACILITY
TERMINATION DATE. The Borrower may request an extension of the Revolving Credit
Termination Date and Facility Termination Date by submitting a request for an
extension to the Agent (an "EXTENSION REQUEST") no more than sixty (60) days
prior to the then effective Revolving Credit Termination Date. The Extension
Request must specify the new Revolving Credit Termination Date and Facility
Termination Date requested by the Borrower and the date (which must be at least
thirty (30) days after the Extension Request is delivered to the Agent) as of
which the Lenders must respond to the Extension Request (the "RESPONSE DATE").
The new Revolving Credit Termination Date shall be no more than 364 days after
the Revolving Credit Termination Date in

                                      -18-
<Page>

effect at the time the Extension Request is received, including the current
Revolving Credit Termination Date as one of the days in the calculation of the
days elapsed and the new Facility Termination Date shall be one (1) year after
the new Revolving Credit Termination Date. Promptly upon receipt of an Extension
Request, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the contents thereof and shall
request each Lender to approve the Extension Request. Each Lender may, in its
sole discretion, elect to approve or deny such Extension Request. Failure of a
Lender to respond to an Extension Request by the Response Date shall be deemed a
refusal to approve such Extension Request. Each Lender approving the Extension
Request shall deliver its written consent no later than the Response Date. If
the consent of each of the Lenders is received by the Agent, the Revolving
Credit Termination Date and Facility Termination Date specified in the Extension
Request shall become effective on the existing Revolving Credit Termination Date
and the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each Lender of the new
Revolving Credit Termination Date and Facility Termination Date. In the event
that a consent is not received from each of the Lenders, then there shall be no
extension of the existing Revolving Credit Termination Date and Facility
Termination Date.

     2.20.    REPLACEMENT OF LENDER. If the Borrower is required pursuant to
SECTION 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Alternate Base Rate
Advances into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to SECTION 3.3
(any Lender so affected an "AFFECTED LENDER"), the Borrower may elect, if such
amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace
such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, PROVIDED that no
Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time
of such replacement, and PROVIDED FURTHER that, concurrently with such
replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory
to the Borrower and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash
the Advances and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an
assignment substantially in the form of EXHIBIT C and to become a Lender for all
purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected
Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of
SECTION 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such
Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all
interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender
by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including
without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2
and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been
due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under SECTION 3.4 had the
Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the
replacement Lender.

                                   ARTICLE III
                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

     3.1.     YIELD PROTECTION. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable

                                      -19-
<Page>

agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Lender or applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency:

              (a)  subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
     to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with
     respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its Eurodollar
     Loans, or

              (b)  imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
     assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
     against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
     by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves
     and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate
     applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

              (c)  imposes any other condition the result of which is to
     increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of
     making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or reduces any amount
     receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in
     connection with its Eurodollar Loans, or requires any Lender or any
     applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference
     to the amount of Eurodollar Loans held or interest received by it, by an
     amount deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or
Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Installation in connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then,
within fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
increased cost or reduction in amount received.

     3.2.     CHANGES IN CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS. If a Lender determines
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a Change, then, within fifteen (15) days of demand
by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to
compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this
Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking
into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "CHANGE" means (a)
any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines
or (b) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this
Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any Person controlling
any Lender. "RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES" means (a) the risk-based capital
guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (b) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation

                                      -20-
<Page>

and Supervisory Practices entitled "International Convergence of Capital
Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any
amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

     3.3.     AVAILABILITY OF TYPES OF ADVANCES. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, interpretation or directive,
whether or not having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine
that (a) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar
Advances are not available or (b) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar
Advances does not accurately or fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining
Eurodollar Advances, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar
Advances and require any affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted
to Alternate Base Rate Advances, subject to the payment of any funding
indemnification amounts required by SECTION 3.4.

     3.4.     FUNDING INDEMNIFICATION. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance
occurs on a date prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar
Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other
than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any
loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation,
any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or
maintain such Eurodollar Advance.

     3.5.     TAXES. (a) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this SECTION 3.5) such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such
deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall
furnish to the Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof
within thirty (30) days after such payment is made.

              (b)  In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present
     or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
     taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
     hereunder or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or
     otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("OTHER TAXES").

              (c)  The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and each
     Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
     limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this
     SECTION 3.5) paid by the Agent or such Lender and any liability (including
     penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
     thereto. Payments due under this indemnification shall be

                                      -21-
<Page>

     made within thirty (30) days of the date the Agent or such Lender makes
     demand therefor pursuant to SECTION 3.6.

              (d)  Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
     United States of America or a state thereof (each a "NON-U.S. LENDER")
     agrees that it will, not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of
     this Agreement, (i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly
     completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
     W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
     payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
     United States federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of the
     Borrower and the Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9, as
     the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption from
     United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further
     undertakes, to the extent lawful at such time, to deliver to each of the
     Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or
     any successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes
     obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in
     the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
     amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
     Agent. All forms or amendments described in the preceding sentence shall
     certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
     Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
     income taxes, UNLESS an event (including without limitation any change in
     treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
     delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
     inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and
     delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender
     advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving
     payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
     income tax.

              (e)  For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
     provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to CLAUSE (d), above
     (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or
     any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
     governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form
     originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be
     entitled to indemnification under this SECTION 3.5 with respect to Taxes
     imposed by the United States; PROVIDED that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which
     is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax
     become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
     under CLAUSE (d), above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such
     Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to
     recover such Taxes.

              (f)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
     reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement
     or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty
     shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or
     times prescribed by applicable law, such properly

                                      -22-
<Page>

     completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will
     permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

              (g)   If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other
     governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any
     political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not
     properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
     (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed,
     because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances
     which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other
     reason not caused by or constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct
     of the Agent), such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts
     paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or
     otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by
     any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Agent under this subsection,
     together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto (including
     reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable time charges of attorneys for the
     Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent). The obligations of
     the Lenders under this SECTION 3.5(g) shall survive the payment of the
     Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     3.6.     LENDER STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITY. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under SECTION 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under SECTION 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such
written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon
which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. The Borrower shall
have no obligation to reimburse, compensate or indemnify any Lender with respect
to a claim under this ARTICLE III if the Lender fails to deliver such written
statement within 180 days after the date on which the Lender becomes aware of
the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim. Determination of amounts
payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be
calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase
of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a
reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in
fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount
specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand
after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of the
Borrower under SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the
Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

                                      -23-

              (d)  All legal matters incident to the making of such Advance
shall be satisfactory to the Lenders and their counsel.

     Each Borrowing Notice with respect to each such Advance shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that the conditions contained in
SECTION 4.2 have been satisfied. Any Lender may require a duly completed
compliance certificate in substantially the form of EXHIBIT B hereto as a
condition to making an Advance.

                                    ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

     5.1.     CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND STANDING. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly and properly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and is
duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation and is duly
authorized to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is
conducted or proposed to be conducted except where failure to be so qualified or
authorized could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.2.     AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The Borrower has all requisite power
and authority (corporate and otherwise) and legal right to execute and deliver
each of the Loan Documents and

                                      -25-
<Page>

to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the
Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder
have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings and the Loan Documents
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable
against the Borrower, in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

     5.3.     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND CONTRACTS. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all applicable
statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign
government or any instrumentality or agency thereof, having jurisdiction over
the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective
properties, except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, the application of the proceeds of the
Loans, or any other transaction contemplated in the Loan Documents, nor
compliance with the provisions of the Loan Documents will, or at the relevant
time did, (a) violate any law, rule, regulation (including Regulation U), order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's charter, articles or
certificate of incorporation or by-laws, (b) violate the provisions of or
require the approval or consent of any party to any indenture, instrument or
agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject, or
by which it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default
thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than
Liens permitted by the Loan Documents) in, of or on the property of the Borrower
or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or
agreement, or (c) require any consent of the stockholders of any Person, except
for any violation of, or failure to obtain an approval or consent required
under, any such indenture, instrument or agreement that could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.4.     GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. No order, consent, approval, qualification,
license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of, any court, governmental or
public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, any securities exchange or
other Person is or at the relevant time was required to authorize, or is or at
the relevant time was required in connection with the execution, delivery,
consummation or performance of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or
enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents, the application of the proceeds of
the Loans or any other transactions contemplated in the Loan Documents. Neither
the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under or in violation of any
foreign, federal, state or local law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding upon or applicable to the Borrower or such
Subsidiary, in each case the consequence of which default or violation could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.5.     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Borrower has heretofore furnished to
each of the Lenders (a) the December 31, 2001 audited consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and

                                      -26-
<Page>

its Subsidiaries, and (b) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries through September 30, 2002 (collectively, the
"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). Each of the Financial Statements was prepared in
accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles and fairly presents the
consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries at such dates and the consolidated results of their operations for
the respective periods then ended (except, in the case of such unaudited
statements, for normal year-end audit adjustments).

     5.6.     MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since December 31, 2001, there has been
no change in the business, Property, condition (financial or otherwise),
performance, prospects or results of operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     5.7.     TAXES. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed or caused to
be filed on a timely basis and in correct form all United States federal, state
and other material tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid all
taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in
good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance
with Agreement Accounting Principles and as to which no Lien exists. As of the
date hereof, the United States income tax returns of the Borrower on a
consolidated basis have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service through its
Fiscal Year ending December 31, 1997. No tax liens have been filed and no claims
are being asserted with respect to any such taxes which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves
on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or
other governmental charges are in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

     5.8.     LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. There is no litigation,
arbitration, proceeding, inquiry or governmental investigation (including,
without limitation, by the Federal Trade Commission) pending or, to the
knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, enjoin or unduly delay
the making of the Loans under this Agreement.

     5.9.     ERISA. The Funded Current Liability Percentage of each Single
Employer Plan for the current plan year is at least eighty percent (80%).
Neither the Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group maintains, or
is obligated to contribute to, any Multiemployer Plan or has incurred, or is
reasonably expected to incur, any withdrawal liability to any Multiemployer
Plan. Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and regulations. Neither the Borrower nor any member of the
Controlled Group has, with respect to any Plan, failed to make any contribution
or pay any amount required under Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
or the terms of such Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened claims, actions, investigations or lawsuits against any Plan, any
fiduciary thereof, or the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group with
respect to a Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled Group has engaged
in any prohibited transaction (as

                                      -27-
<Page>

defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) in connection with
any Plan which would subject such Person to any material liability. Within the
last five (5) years neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled Group
has engaged in a transaction which resulted in a Single Employer Plan with an
Unfunded Liability being transferred out of the Controlled Group which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Termination Event
has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Plan which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     5.10.    DEFAULTS. No Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing.

     5.11.    REGULATION U. Margin Stock constitutes less than 25% of those
assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation
on sale, pledge or other restriction hereunder. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is engaged, directly or indirectly, principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending, or arranging for the
extension of, credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock. No
part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used in a manner which would violate,
or result in a violation of, Regulation U. Neither the making of any Advance
hereunder nor the use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent
with the provisions of Regulation U.

     5.12.    INVESTMENT COMPANY; PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY. Neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is, or after giving effect to any Advance will be,
an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither
the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of a
"holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", within
the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

     5.13.    OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTIES. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries have a subsisting leasehold interest in, or good
and marketable title, free of all Liens, other than those permitted by SECTION
6.12 or by any of the other Loan Documents, to all of the properties and assets
reflected in the Financial Statements as being owned by it, except for assets
sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business
since the date thereof. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or possess rights
to use all licenses, patents, patent applications, copyrights, service marks,
trademarks and trade names necessary to continue to conduct their business as
heretofore conducted, and no such license, patent or trademark has been declared
invalid, been limited by order of any court or by agreement or is the subject of
any infringement, interference or similar proceeding or challenge, except for
proceedings and challenges which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     5.14.    MATERIAL AGREEMENTS. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or which restricts or imposes conditions upon the ability of any
Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends or make other distributions on its capital
stock, (b) make loans or advances to the Borrower or (c) repay loans or advances
from the Borrower. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the
performance,

                                      -28-
<Page>

observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions
contained in any agreement to which it is a party, which default could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.15.    ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. There are no claims, investigations,
litigation, administrative proceedings, notices, requests for information (each
a "PROCEEDING"), whether pending or threatened, or judgments or orders asserting
violations of applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and
safety statutes, regulations, ordinances, codes, rules, orders, decrees,
directives and standards ("ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS") or relating to any toxic or
hazardous waste, substance or chemical or any pollutant, contaminant, chemical
or other substance defined or regulated pursuant to any Environmental Law,
including, without limitation, asbestos, petroleum, crude oil or any fraction
thereof ("HAZARDOUS MATERIALS") asserted against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries which, in any case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has caused or permitted
any Hazardous Materials to be released, either on or under real property,
currently or formerly, legally or beneficially owned or operated by the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or on or under real property to which the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries transported, arranged for the transport or disposal of, or
disposed of Hazardous Materials, which release could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.16.    INSURANCE. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries maintain, with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance on their Property
in such amounts and covering such risks as is consistent with sound business
practice.

     5.17.    INSURANCE LICENSES. No material license, permit or authorization
of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to engage in the business of insurance or
insurance-related activities is the subject of a proceeding for suspension or
revocation, except where such suspension or revocation would not individually or
in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.18.    DISCLOSURE. None of the (a) information, exhibits or reports
furnished or to be furnished by the Borrower or any Subsidiary to the Agent or
to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of the Loan Documents, or (b)
representations or warranties of the Borrower or any Subsidiary contained in
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or any other document, certificate or
written statement furnished to the Agent or the Lenders by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as the case may be, contained, contains or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, omits or will omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
herein or therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same
were made. As of the date hereof, there is no fact known to the Borrower (other
than matters of a general economic nature) that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and that has not been disclosed
herein or in such other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the
Lenders for use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Person.

     6.3.     NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Borrower will give prompt notice in writing

of any other event or development, financial or other, relating specifically to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (and not of a general economic or
political nature) which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     6.4.     CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same
manner and in substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently

     6.7.     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs,

Adverse Effect.

     6.8.     MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, do all things necessary to maintain, preserve, protect and keep
its Property in good repair, working order and condition, and make all necessary

connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times.

     6.9.     INSPECTION. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,

accounts and other financial records of the Borrower and each Subsidiary, and to
discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and each Subsidiary
with, and to be advised as to the same by, their respective officers at such
reasonable times and intervals as the Lenders may designate. The Borrower will
keep or cause to be kept, and cause each Subsidiary to keep or cause to be kept,

capital stock or any options or other rights in respect thereof at any time
outstanding.

to, merge or consolidate with or into any other Person, except that (a) a
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary may merge into the Borrower or any Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary of the Borrower, (b) the Borrower or any Subsidiary may merge or
consolidate with any other Person so long as the Borrower or such Subsidiary is
the continuing or surviving corporation and, prior to and after giving effect to
such merger or consolidation, no Default or Unmatured Default shall exist, and
(c) any Subsidiary may enter into a merger or consolidation as a means of
effecting a disposition or acquisition which would not result in a Default or
Unmatured Default.

     6.12.    LIENS. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
to, create, incur, or suffer to exist any Lien in, of or on the Property of the

the creation of additional Liens otherwise allowed hereunder shall be permitted

transfer to, any Affiliate except (a) for transactions between the Borrower and
any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower or between Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries
of the Borrower and (b) in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to the
reasonable requirements of the Borrower's or such Subsidiary's business and upon
fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary
than the Borrower or such Subsidiary would obtain in a comparable arms-length

Year to end on any date other than December 31 of each year.

     6.15.    INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS. The Borrower shall not, nor shall it
permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any indenture, agreement, instrument or
other arrangement which, (a) directly or indirectly prohibits or restrains, or

conditions upon, the incurrence of the Obligations, the amending of the Loan
Documents or the ability of any Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make other
distributions on its capital stock, (ii) make loans or advances to the Borrower
or (iii) repay loans or advances from the Borrower or (b) contains any provision
which would be violated or breached by the making of Advances or by the

     than 4.0 to 1.0.

     6.18.    ERISA. The Borrower will (a) fulfill, and cause each member of the
Controlled Group to fulfill, its obligations under the minimum funding standards
of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan, (b) comply, and cause each
member of the Controlled Group to

                                      -34-

comply, with all applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to
each Plan, except where such failure or noncompliance individually or in the
aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (c) not, and not permit
any member of the Controlled Group to, (i) seek a waiver of the minimum funding
standards under ERISA, (ii) terminate or withdraw from any Plan or (iii) take
any other action with respect to any Plan which would reasonably be expected to
entitle the PBGC to terminate, impose liability in respect of, or cause a
trustee to be appointed to administer, any Plan, unless the actions or events
described in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) individually or in the
aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

     8.1.     ACCELERATION. If any Default described in SECTION 7.6 or 7.7
occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or

                                      -36-
<Page>

action on the part of the Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent or upon the instruction of the
Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to
make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both,
whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower
hereby expressly waives.

     If, within ten (10) Business Days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
SECTION 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
entered, the Required Lenders (or, in the case of an acceleration and/or
termination upon the occurrence of a Default under SECTION 7.10, the Modified
Required Lenders), in their sole discretion, shall so direct, the Agent shall,
by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or
termination.

     8.2.     AMENDMENTS. Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII, the
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or thereunder
or waiving any Default hereunder or thereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such
supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender:

              (a)  Extend the Facility Termination Date or the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, compromise or forgive the principal amount of any Loan, or
reduce the rate of interest or compromise or forgive payment of interest on any
Loan, or reduce the amount of any fee payable hereunder;

              (b)  Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Lenders or Modified Required Lenders;

              (c)  Increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender
hereunder (except pursuant to SECTION 2.5(b));

              (d)  Amend this SECTION 8.2; or

              (e)  Permit any assignment by the Borrower of its Obligations or
its rights hereunder.

PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the
consent of the Modified Required Lenders, amend the definition of "Change in
Control" or amend or waive SECTION 7.10.

                                      -37-
<Page>

     No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall
be effective without the written consent of the Agent. The Agent may waive
payment of the fee required under SECTION 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent
of any other party to this Agreement.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the execution and delivery of all
documentation required by SECTION 2.5(b) to be delivered in connection with an
increase to the Aggregate Commitment, the Agent, the Borrower and the new or
existing Lenders whose Commitments have been affected may and shall enter into
an amendment hereof (which shall be binding on all parties hereto) solely for
the purpose of reflecting any new Lenders and their new Commitments and any
increase in the Commitment of any existing Lender.

     8.3.     PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to SECTION 8.2, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

     9.1.     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS. All representations and warranties of
the Borrower contained in this Agreement or of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
contained in any Loan Document shall survive the making of the Loans herein
contemplated.

     9.2.     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to
the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

     9.3.     HEADINGS. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

     9.4.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other than the fee letter
described in SECTION 10.13.

     9.5.     SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS; BENEFITS OF THIS AGREEMENT. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any

                                      -38-
<Page>

other (except to the extent to which the Agent is authorized to act as such).
The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not
relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement
shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and
assigns; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the parties hereto expressly agree that the
Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of SECTIONS 9.6, 9.10 and
10.11 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to
enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own name to the same extent
as if it were a party to this Agreement.

     9.6.     EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent
and the Arranger for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses
(including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent or the
Arranger, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or the Arranger) paid or
incurred by the Agent or the Arranger in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, distribution (including, without
limitation, via the internet), review, amendment, modification, and
administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse the
Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and
out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys
for the Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of
the Agent, the Arranger or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Agent, the
Arranger or any Lender in connection with the collection of the Obligations or
the enforcement of the Loan Documents. The Borrower further agrees to indemnify
the Agent, the Arranger, each Lender, their respective affiliates, and each of
their directors, officers and employees against all losses, claims, damages,
penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation,
all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Agent, the
Arranger, any Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto) which any of them may
pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby, or the direct or indirect
application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder except
to the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The obligations of the
Borrower under this SECTION 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

     9.7.     NUMBERS OF DOCUMENTS. All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient
counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.

     9.8.     ACCOUNTING. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

     9.9.     SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

                                      -39-
<Page>

     9.10.    NONLIABILITY OF LENDERS. The relationship between the Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders and the Agent on the other hand shall be solely
that of borrower and lender. Neither the Agent, the Arranger nor any Lender
shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower. Neither the Agent,
the Arranger nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to
review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the
Borrower's business or operations. Neither the Agent, the Arranger nor any
Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives,
releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or
in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby.

     9.11.    CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential
information which it may receive from the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence, except for disclosure (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and
their respective Affiliates, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other
professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee, (iii) to regulatory
officials, (iv) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required by law,

proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (vi) to such Lender's direct or
indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements or to legal counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors to such counterparties, and (vii)
permitted by Section 12.4.

     9.12.    DISCLOSURE. The Borrower and each Lender hereby acknowledge and
agree that Bank One and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold investments
in, make other loans to or have other relationships with the Borrower and its
Affiliates.

                                    THE AGENT

     10.1.    APPOINTMENT. Bank One, NA is hereby appointed by each of the
Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the "Agent")
hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders
irrevocably (subject to Section 10.12) authorizes the Agent to act as the
contractual representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to act as
such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this
ARTICLE X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly
understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting
as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to
those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency
theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of
which claims each Lender hereby waives.

     10.2.    POWERS. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under
the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of
each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder, except any action specifically provided
by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

     10.3.    GENERAL IMMUNITY. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower or any Lender for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent
such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Person.

     10.4.    NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOANS, RECITALS, ETC. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty
or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in ARTICLE IV, except
receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Agent; (d) the existence
or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document
or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the
value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any
collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of the

                                      -41-
<Page>

Borrower or any guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower's
or any such guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have no duty to
disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the
Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower
to the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).

     10.5.    ACTION ON INSTRUCTIONS OF LENDERS. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders or, if expressly required hereunder, the Modified Required
Lenders or all the Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The
Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any
discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in
writing to do so by the Required Lenders or, if expressly required hereunder,
the Modified Required Lenders or all the Lenders. The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any
other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by
the Lenders pro-rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may
incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

     10.6.    EMPLOYMENT OF AGENTS AND COUNSEL. The Agent may execute any of its
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

     10.7.    RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS; COUNSEL. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

     10.8.    AGENT'S REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or

                                      -42-
<Page>

asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other
documents, PROVIDED that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing
to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required
pursuant to SECTION 3.5(g) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this SECTION
10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof.
The obligations of the Lenders under this SECTION 10.8 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     10.9.    NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder unless
the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to
this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such
a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

     10.10.   RIGHTS AS A LENDER. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

     10.11.   LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     10.12.   SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, 45 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or

                                      -43-
<Page>

removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the
Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty (30) days after the
resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning
Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any time without the
consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a
commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the Agent has resigned or
been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform
all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments
in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other
purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders; PROVIDED, such Lenders so
performing such duties shall be deemed to be an Agent hereunder with full
benefit of all provisions indemnifying the Agent hereunder. No successor Agent
shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has
accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this ARTICLE X shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the
Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this
SECTION 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean
the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

     10.13.   AGENT AND ARRANGER FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent
and the Arranger, for their respective accounts, the fees agreed to by the
Borrower, the Agent and the Arranger pursuant to that certain letter agreement
dated December 10, 2002, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.

     10.14.   DELEGATION TO AFFILIATES. The Borrower and the Lenders agree that
the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under ARTICLES IX and X.

     10.15.   SYNDICATION AGENTS; SENIOR MANAGING AGENTS; MANAGING AGENTS. None
of the Lenders identified in this Agreement as the "Syndication Agents", "Senior
Managing Agents" or "Managing Agents" shall have any right, power, obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement in such identified
capacity other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting
the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary
relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments
with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the Agent in SECTION
10.11.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

     11.1.    SETOFF. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such
Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

     11.2.    RATABLE PAYMENTS. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
SECTION 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5 or 9.6) in a greater proportion than that received by
any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a
portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each
Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender, whether in
connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise,
receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts
which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such
collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans. In case any such payment is
disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall
be made. If an amount to be setoff is to be applied to Indebtedness of the
Borrower to a Lender, other than Indebtedness comprised of Loans made by such
Lender, such amount shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to
the Indebtedness comprised of such Loans.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

     12.1.    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except
that (i) the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or
obligations under the Loan Documents, (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be
made in compliance with SECTION 12.3 and (iii) any participation must be made in
compliance with SECTION 12.2. Any attempted assignment or transfer by any party
not made in compliance with this SECTION 12.1 shall be null and void, unless
such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in
accordance with SECTION 12.3.2. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that
clause (ii) of this SECTION 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this
SECTION 12.1 does not prohibit assignments creating security interests,
including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal
Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or
assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note
to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties
thereto have complied with the provisions of SECTION 12.3. The Agent may treat
the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as

                                      -45-
<Page>

the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies
with SECTION 12.3; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Agent may in its discretion (but
shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to
another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by
acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the
Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time
of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the
rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof),
shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the
rights to such Loan.

     12.2.    PARTICIPATIONS.

              12.2.1.  PERMITTED PARTICIPANTS; EFFECT. Any Lender may, in the
     ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at
     any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("PARTICIPANTS")
     participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by
     such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such
     Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender
     of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations
     under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain
     solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
     obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder
     of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the
     Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement
     shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating
     interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and
     directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
     obligations under the Loan Documents.

              12.2.2.  VOTING RIGHTS. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
     approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
     modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than
     any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or
     Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require
     consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of SECTION 8.2 or of
     any other Loan Document.

              12.2.3.  BENEFIT OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. The Borrower agrees that
     each Participant which has been identified as such to the Borrower in
     writing shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in SECTION
     11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the
     Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating
     interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents;
     PROVIDED, that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in
     SECTION 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to
     each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and
     each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in SECTION
     11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the
     exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance
     with SECTION 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender. The Borrower
     further agrees that each

                                      -46-
<Page>

     Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of SECTIONS 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and
     3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
     by assignment pursuant to SECTION 12.3, PROVIDED that (i) a Participant
     shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under SECTION 3.1, 3.2
     or 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such
     Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own
     account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made with
     the prior written consent of the Borrower, and (ii) any Participant not
     incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any State
     thereof agrees to comply with the provisions of SECTION 3.5 to the same
     extent as if it were a Lender.

     12.3.    ASSIGNMENTS.

              12.3.1.  PERMITTED ASSIGNMENTS. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
     course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time
     assign to one or more banks or other entities ("PURCHASERS") all or any
     part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents; PROVIDED that
     no Lender's Commitment shall be greater than 20% of the Aggregate
     Commitment after the effectiveness of any assignment. Such assignment shall
     be substantially in the form of EXHIBIT C or in such other form as may be
     agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Borrower and the Agent
     shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to
     a Purchaser which is not a Lender, an Affiliate thereof or an Approved
     Fund; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing,
     the consent of the Borrower shall not be required. Such consent shall not
     be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each such assignment with respect to a
     Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof shall (unless each
     of the Borrower and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an amount not less
     than the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount of the
     assigning Lender's Commitment or outstanding Loans (if the applicable
     Commitment has been terminated). The amount of the assignment shall be
     based on the Commitment or outstanding Loans (if the applicable Commitment
     has been terminated) subject to the assignment, determined as of the date
     of such assignment or as of the "Trade Date", if the "Trade Date" is
     specified in the assignment.

              12.3.2.  EFFECT; EFFECTIVE DATE. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of
     an assignment, together with any consents required by SECTION 12.3.1, and
     (ii) payment of a $4,000 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment,
     such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in
     such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation by the
     Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the
     purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment
     agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the
     rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will
     not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such
     assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
     Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the
     Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the
     Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto,
     and no further

                                      -47-
<Page>

     consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be
     required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of
     the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser. In the case
     of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
     obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender
     hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject
     to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which
     survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable
     agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
     under this Agreement that does not comply with this SECTION 12.3 shall be
     treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
     participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with SECTION
     12.2. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to
     this SECTION 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower
     shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be
     evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as
     appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new
     Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser,
     in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments,
     as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

              12.3.3.  REGISTER. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
     agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago,
     Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a
     register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and
     the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each
     Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The
     entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent
     and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
     Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
     purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
     Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender,
     at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     12.4.    DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. The Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "TRANSFEREE") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section
9.11 of this Agreement.

     12.5.    TAX TREATMENT. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred
to any Transferee which is not organized under the laws of the United States or
any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the
provisions of SECTION 3.5(d).

     13.1.    GIVING NOTICE. Except as otherwise permitted by SECTION 2.14 with
respect to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to

case of any party, at such other address or facsimile number as such party may
hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the Borrower in

or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile
transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section
and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after
such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid,
addressed as aforesaid, or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered

in this Section; PROVIDED that notices to the Agent under ARTICLE II shall not
be effective until received. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section, the Borrower may furnish the financial statements described in SECTIONS
6.1(a) and 6.1(b) by email or by posting such financial statements on an
internet web site made available to the Lenders.

     13.2.    CHANGE OF ADDRESS. The Borrower, the Agent and any Lender may each
change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the
other parties hereto.

                                  COUNTERPARTS

     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which
taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may
execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Agreement shall be
effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
and each party has notified the Agent by facsimile transmission or telephone
that it has taken such action.

                                   ARTICLE XV
          CHOICE OF LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

     15.1.    CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 735 ILCS SECTION 105/5-1 ET
SEQ, BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS) OF THE
STATE OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL
BANKS.

     15.2.    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS
TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR ILLINOIS STATE
COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT
ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A
COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT
THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER
IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER
AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER
INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED
TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

     15.3.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY
WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

         Subject to the following two sentences, a particular Level Status shall
exist on a particular day if on such day the Borrower does not qualify for a
Level Status with more advantageous pricing and either the Moody's Rating or the
S&P Rating is at least equal to the corresponding rating specified for such
Level Status in the table above. In the event of a

     Revolving Credit Termination Date, at all times and (ii) prior to the
     Revolving Credit Termination Date, only with respect to outstanding
     Advances on days when Utilization is greater than 33%. "Utilization" means,
     for any day, a percentage equal to the aggregate principal amount of Loans
     hereunder and "Loans" (as defined in the Three Year Agreement) outstanding
     on such day (and at the close of business on such day if a Business Day)

     "Aggregate Commitment" under the Three Year Agreement; PROVIDED that for
     purposes of computing Utilization (a) the Aggregate Commitment shall be
     deemed to in no event be less than the aggregate outstanding principal
     amount of the Loans and (b) the "Aggregate Commitment" (as defined in the
     Three Year Agreement) shall be deemed to in no event be less than the
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of the "Loans" (as defined in the
     Three Year Agreement).

difference in the equivalent "rating level" from S&P and Moody's resulting in a
split of only one level, then the Level Status shall be determined by reference
to the higher of the two Ratings. In the event of a difference in the equivalent
"rating level" from S&P and Moody's resulting in a split of greater than one
level, then the Level Status shall be that Level Status one below the Level
Status determined by reference to the higher of the two Ratings. The above
ratings are in the format of S&P Rating/Moody's Rating.

     For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the following
meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:

     "Level Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III
Status, Level IV Status, Level V Status or Level VI Status.

     "Moody's Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by
Moody's and then in effect.

     "Rating" means Moody's Rating or S&P Rating.

     "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by S&P and
then in effect.

     The Applicable Margin, Applicable Facility Fee Rate, Applicable Utilization
Fee Rate and Applicable Term Out Premium shall be determined in accordance with
the foregoing table based on the Borrower's Level Status as determined from its
then-current Moody's and S&P Ratings. The Rating in effect on any date for the
purposes of this Schedule is that in effect at the close of business on such
date. If at any time the Borrower has no Moody's Rating or no S&P Rating or the
Borrower does not qualify for a Level Status with more advantageous pricing,
Level VI Status shall exist.
