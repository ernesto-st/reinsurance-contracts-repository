that any compensation paid to a Participant for a taxable year of the Company would not be deductible by the Company or the Employer solely by reason of the limitation under Code Section&nbsp;162(m), then to the extent deemed necessary by the
Committee to ensure that the entire amount of any distribution to the Participant pursuant to this Plan is deductible, the Committee may delay all or any portion of a distribution under this Plan. The amounts so delayed shall be distributed to the
Participant or his Beneficiary (in the event of the Participant&#146;s death) at the earliest possible date, as determined by the Committee in good faith, on which the deductibility of compensation paid or payable to the Participant for the taxable
year of the Company or the Employer during which the distribution is made will not be limited by Code Section&nbsp;162(m). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">10.11 <U>Prohibited

of the time or schedule of any payment from the Plan as would require immediate income tax to Participants based on the law in effect at the time the distribution is to be made, including Section&nbsp;409A. In addition, a payment may be delayed
after a designated payment date under the circumstances described in Section&nbsp;409A, including payments subject to Code Section&nbsp;162(m), or payments that would violate federal securities or other applicable law. In such case, payment will be
made at the earliest date on which the Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will not cause such violation. The making of a payment that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or
other provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable law. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
