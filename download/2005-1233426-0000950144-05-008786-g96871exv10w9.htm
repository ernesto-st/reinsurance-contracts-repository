<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Each Party shall carry out its duties and obligations under this Agreement in material
compliance with all applicable Laws. USPG shall provide Services under this Agreement to Enrollees

requirements of the Medicare statutes, regulations, CMS guidance and CIGNA policies, including but
not limited to CIGNA&#146;s CMS-required compliance programs with respect to Medicare Part&nbsp;D, as amended
from time to time, and training thereon, <U>provided, however</U>, that such policies and

excess of that required from CIGNA&#146;s other Part&nbsp;D subcontractors. USPG shall maintain all
applicable licenses required to carry out its business activities and shall further comply with

necessary to permit it to perform the Services, or USPG determines that it is required to obtain
such licenses, or in the event that CIGNA concludes in good faith after reasonable investigation
that USPG is required to obtain such licenses, and USPG does not possess such licenses, then USPG
shall have a period of ninety (90)&nbsp;days within which to file applications for such licenses. If,
after one hundred twenty (120)&nbsp;days from the last day of such ninety (90)&nbsp;day period USPG does not
possess at least seventy-five (75%) percent of such licenses, then CIGNA shall be entitled to

performance into compliance including, but not limited to, requiring USPG to perform the work or

foregoing cure provisions, if it is later determined that USPG&#146;s and/or NationsHealth&#146;s
certification in this Section was erroneous on the Effective Date of this Agreement or has become
erroneous by reason of new or changed circumstances, in addition to other remedies available to
CIGNA, CIGNA may terminate this Agreement for convenience, at its sole discretion.

<U>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9.01 <U>Disputes</U>. This Article&nbsp;IX sets forth the sole source of remedies
available to the Parties with regard to any and all disputes between them arising in connection
with this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as &#147;Disputes&#148;) including all questions of
arbitrability, the existence, validity, scope or termination of this Agreement or any term thereof;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Parties agree that money damages may not be an adequate
remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and that a Party may, in its discretion,
apply to a court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction located in a venue set forth in Section
11.09 for specific performance and injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations
of this Agreement and any Party against whom such proceeding is brought hereby waives the claim or
defense that such Party has an adequate remedy at law and agrees not to raise the defense that the
other Party has an adequate remedy at law. The Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve
any and all Disputes. Any Disputes that the Parties are unable to satisfactorily resolve by
discussion and negotiation between themselves in good faith and within a thirty (30)&nbsp;day period
from the time notice of the Dispute is provided to the other Party shall be referred to the
Committee. The Committee shall use reasonable business efforts to resolve the Dispute within
thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receiving written notice of the Dispute, or such other period of time as
mutually agreed between the Parties. The Committee acting by unanimous consent shall have the
authority to waive the Dispute; designate specific corrective or alternative action; set a time
period for certain performance; take other mutually agreeable action or submit the matter to
arbitration, <U>provided, however</U>, that the Committee shall have no authority to amend the
terms of this Agreement, which may only be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9.02 <U>Commencing Arbitration</U>. If the Committee is unable to resolve any such
Dispute or agree upon appropriate action within thirty (30)&nbsp;days following the date one Party sent
written notice of the Dispute to the Committee, or such other period of time as mutually agreed
between the Parties, and if a Party wishes to pursue the Dispute, such Party may thereafter submit
the Dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association&#146;s
Procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes, as they may be amended from time to time (see
http://www.adr.org). Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, the Party wishing to
pursue the Dispute must initiate the arbitration within one year after the date on which the
Dispute was submitted to the Committee or shall be deemed to have waived its right to pursue the
Dispute in any forum. Any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement shall be conducted in
Hartford, Connecticut. The arbitrator(s) may construe or interpret but shall not vary or ignore the
terms of this Agreement and shall be bound by controlling Law. The arbitrator(s) shall have no
authority to award special, consequential, incidental or punitive damages.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9.03 <U>Decision Binding; Federal Arbitration Act</U>. The decision of the
arbitrator(s) regarding the Dispute will be binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties acknowledge that because this Agreement affects
interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act applies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9.04 <U>Waiver; Survival</U>. In the event any court determines that this
arbitration procedure is not binding or otherwise allows litigation involving a Dispute to proceed,
the Parties hereby waive any and all right to trial by jury in, or with respect to, such
litigation. This Article&nbsp;IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
