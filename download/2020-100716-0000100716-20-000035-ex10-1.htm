handling of all such run-off insurance business until all Policies have expired either by cancellation or by terms of such Policies

expenses. If for any reason the General Agent fails or is unable to service any such run-off business (or any business while the
Agreement is still in effect), including the payment of claims, then consistent with this Agreement, the Reinsurer's obligation
with respect to such run-off business shall continue and the Reinsurer shall appoint a successor to the General Agent, subject
to the approval of the Company, to administer and otherwise handle the run-off as provided herein. Such successor shall perform
all of the duties and obligations of the General Agent with respect to servicing such run-off business, including the payment of
claims. In addition, the Company in its sole discretion may terminate the authority of the General Agent or a successor thereto
to handle such run-off business and the Reinsurer shall then appoint a successor to handle the run-off, subject to the Company's
approval, at no cost to the Company.</P>
