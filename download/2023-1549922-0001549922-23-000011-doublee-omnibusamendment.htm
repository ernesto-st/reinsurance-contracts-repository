(vi) If any Working Capital Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Bank Funding Rate from time to time in effect, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the relevant L/C Issuer submitted to any Working Capital Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Repayment of Letter of Credit Participations. (i) If, at any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Working Capital Lender such Working 12 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 Capital Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Working Capital Lender its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the relevant L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 13 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 </FONT></DIV>

Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Lenders holding a majority of the Working Capital Commitments, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non- appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction; (iii) the form, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness, due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application; (iv) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (v) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of 14 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 any drawing under such Letter of Credit; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; or (vii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the L/C Issuer or Agent-Related Person, as applicable, including any act or omission of any Governmental Authority, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the L/C Issuer&#8217;s or Agent-Related Person&#8217;s rights or powers hereunder. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower&#8217;s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.03(e); provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of documents strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit, in each case as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the L/C Issuers (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by such L/C Issuer to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit; (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by such L/C Issuer; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on such L/C Issuer in any way related to any order issued at the applicant&#8217;s request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject of 15 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 </FONT></DIV>

(g) Cash Collateral. If (i) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, (ii) any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Working Capital Lenders holding a majority of the Working Capital Commitments, as applicable, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or (iii) an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) or (g) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to 102% of such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of Default or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be), and shall do so not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on (x) in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), (1) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12:00 noon (New York City time) or (2) if clause (1) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice and (y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (iii), the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) or (g) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). For purposes hereof, &#8220;Cash Collateralize&#8221; means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant L/C Issuer and the Appropriate Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances (&#8220;Cash Collateral&#8221;) in an amount no less than 102% of the L/C Obligations pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Appropriate Lenders).  Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings.  To further secure the Obligations, the Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuers and the Working Capital Lenders of the applicable Facility, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L/C Issuer. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in a Cash Collateral Account and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are expressly subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is less than 102% of the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) 102% of such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing 16 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer. To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds 102% of the then Outstanding Amount of such L/C Obligations and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. To the extent any Event of Default giving rise to the requirement to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.03(g) is cured or otherwise waived by the Required Lenders, then so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all Cash Collateral pledged to Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit shall be refunded to the Borrower. (h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Working Capital Lenders for the applicable Working Capital Facility (in accordance with their Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement) a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit if such maximum amount increases periodically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit); provided, however, any Letter of Credit fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Pro Rata Shares allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.17(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable in Dollars on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Maturity Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in any Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by such Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. (i) Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable within ten (10) Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable. 17 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 </FONT></DIV>

Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time.

If the Letter of Credit Expiration Date in respect of any tranche of Working Capital Commitments occurs prior to the expiry date of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if consented to by the L/C Issuer which issued such Letter of Credit, if one or more other tranches of Working Capital Commitments in respect of which the Letter of Credit Expiration Date shall not have so occurred are then in effect, such Letters of Credit for which consent has been obtained shall automatically be deemed to have been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Working Capital Lenders to purchase participations therein and to make L/C Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and (d)) under (and ratably participated in by Lenders pursuant to) the Working Capital 18 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 Commitments in respect of such non-terminating tranches up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of the unutilized Working Capital Commitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to immediately preceding clause (i), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.03(g). Upon the maturity date of any tranche of Working Capital Commitments, the commitment for Letters of Credit may be reduced as agreed between the L/C Issuers and the Borrower, without the consent of any other Person.

In the event of any conflict between the Register and the corresponding accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the Register and the corresponding accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.10(a) and (b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.10(a) and (b), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Section 2.11 Payments Generally. (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s applicable Lending Office.  If the Administrative Agent promptly notifies any Lender that a payment was distributed to such Lender in error, each Lender agrees to return any such payment in like funds to the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office upon receipt of notice of the error.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. New York City time shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day, in the Administrative Agent&#8217;s sole discretion, and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loans to be made 28 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then: (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing; and (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment (including, without, limitation, failure to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit), such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Compensation Period&#8221;) at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount (including, without, limitation, failure to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit) forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 29 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 </FONT></DIV>

(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Borrower under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may (to the fullest extent permitted by mandatory provisions of applicable Law), but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the sum (without duplication) of (a) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (b) the Outstanding Amount of all Working Capital Obligations, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender. Section 2.12 Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in Working Capital Obligations held, by it, or any security therefor, any payment or distribution (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other 30 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in the Working Capital Obligations held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or distribution in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment or distribution is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender&#8217;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender&#8217;s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.12 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

Section 9.14 Withholding Tax Indemnity. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.04 and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

(l) Any Lender may at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to Term Loans under this Agreement to a Person who is or will become, after such assignment, an Affiliated Lender through open market purchases on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis, in each case subject to the following limitations: (i) the assigning Lender and the Affiliated Lender purchasing such Lender&#8217;s Term Loans shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 hereto (an &#8220;Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption&#8221;); (ii) Affiliated Lenders will not receive information provided solely to Lenders by the Administrative Agent or any Lender and will not be permitted to attend or participate in conference calls or meetings attended solely by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, other than the right to receive notices of prepayments and other administrative notices in respect of its Loans or Commitments required to be delivered to Lenders pursuant to Article II, and shall not be permitted to challenge the Administrative Agent&#8217;s or any Lender&#8217;s attorney-client privilege; (iii) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans held at any one time by Affiliated Lenders shall not exceed twenty five (25.0%) of the principal amount of all Term Loans at such time outstanding (measured at the time of purchase) (such percentage, the &#8220;Affiliated Lender Cap&#8221;); provided that to the extent any assignment to an Affiliated Lender would result in the aggregate principal amount of all Loans held by Affiliated Lenders exceeding the Affiliated Lender Cap, the assignment of such excess amount will be void ab initio; and (iv) as a condition to each assignment pursuant to this clause (l), the Administrative Agent shall have been provided an Affiliated Lender Notice in the form of Exhibit L-2 to this Agreement in connection with each assignment to an Affiliated Lender or a Person that upon effectiveness of such assignment would constitute an Affiliated Lender pursuant to which such Affiliated Lender shall waive any right to bring any action in connection with such Term Loans against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such. Each Affiliated Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) if it acquires any Person who is also a Lender, and each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) if it becomes an Affiliated Lender. Such notice shall contain the type of information required and be delivered to the same addressee as set forth in Exhibit L-2. (m) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.01 or the definition of &#8220;Required Lenders,&#8221; &#8220;Required Class Lenders&#8221; or &#8220;Required Facility Lenders&#8221; to the contrary, for 131 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 </FONT></DIV>

If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude optional prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

The Agents may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission be confirmed by an original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission. Section 10.12 Integration; Termination. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. The Depositary Bank shall be an express third party beneficiary hereof for purposes of Article IX and Sections 3.01, 10.01, 10.02 and 10.05.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any test or covenant contained in this Agreement with respect to any period during which any Specified Transaction occurs, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall be calculated with respect to such period and such Specified Transaction on a pro forma basis. 3. Rounding. Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement (or required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under this Agreement) shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the 214 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding up if there is no nearest number). 4. References to Agreements, Laws, Etc. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (a) references to Organization Documents, agreements (including the Loan Documents) and other contractual instruments shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications thereto, but only to the extent that such amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications are permitted by the Loan Documents; and (b) references to any Law shall include all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending, replacing, supplementing, implementing or interpreting such Law. 5. Times of Day. Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable). 6. Timing of Payment or Performance. When the payment of any obligation or the performance of any covenant, duty or obligation is stated to be due or performance required on a day which is not a Business Day, the date of such payment (other than as described in the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221;) or performance shall extend to the immediately succeeding Business Day. 7. Negative Covenant Compliance. For purposes of determining whether the Borrower complies with any exception to Article VII where compliance with any such exception is based on a financial ratio or metric being satisfied as of a particular point in time, it is understood that (a) compliance shall be measured at the time when the relevant event is undertaken, as such financial ratios and metrics are intended to be &#8220;incurrence&#8221; tests and not &#8220;maintenance&#8221; tests and (b) correspondingly, any such ratio and metric shall only prohibit the Borrower from creating, incurring, assuming, suffering to exist or making, as the case may be, any new, for example, Liens, Indebtedness or Investments, but shall not result in any previously permitted, for example, Liens, Indebtedness or Investments ceasing to be permitted hereunder. For avoidance of doubt, with respect to determining whether the Borrower complies with any negative covenant in Article VII, to the extent that any obligation or transaction could be attributable to more than one exception to any such negative covenant, the Borrower may elect to categorize all or any portion of such obligation or transaction to any one or more exceptions to such negative covenant that permit such obligation or transaction. 8. Divisions.  For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction&#8217;s laws), including a statutory division pursuant to Section 18-217 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act: (a) if any asset or property of any Person becomes the asset or property of one or more different Persons, then such asset or property shall be deemed to have been Disposed of from the original Person to the subsequent Person(s) on the date such division becomes effective, (b) if any obligation or liability of any Person becomes the obligation or liability of one or more different 215 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 </FONT></DIV>

Rates. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to Base Rate, the Benchmark, any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof or any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, Base Rate, the Benchmark or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability, or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes.  The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of Base Rate, the Benchmark, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain Base Rate or the Benchmark, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service. 216 KE 73718588.20 US-DOCS\142539518.2141222994.8 </FONT></DIV>
