Anything in this Agreement contained to the contrary notwithstanding, it is
expressly understood and agreed that the Loan shall at all times be in balance.
The Loan shall be in balance when each Line Item is in balance, A Line Item
shall be deemed to be in balance if the aggregate of the funds allocated to such
Line Item, after provision for any reallocation then permissible pursuant to
<font style="DISPLAY: inline; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Section 9.11</font>
below, is sufficient to pay the amounts contemplated within such Line Item, as
estimated by TDF, including, without limitation, the payment of interest due
with respect to the Loan through the date of Substantial Completion estimated by
TDF's Consultant, The Company agrees that, if, (i) TDF reasonably determines
that the Loan is not in balance, or (ii) TDF determines that the amount of the
undisbursed Project Funds shall at any time be insufficient, and (iii) the
insufficiency is not caused by an imbalance within the Budget, the Company
shall, within ten (10) days of receipt of written notice from TDF, deposit with
TDF cash or equivalent security or such other security as is acceptable to TDF
in its sole and absolute discretion to eliminate such imbalance. Any funds
deposited with TDF pursuant to this <font style="DISPLAY: inline; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Section 9,10</font> on
account of any deficiency may be applied by TDF or by the Trustee at the
direction of TDF to pay costs of the Line Items as to which such projected or
