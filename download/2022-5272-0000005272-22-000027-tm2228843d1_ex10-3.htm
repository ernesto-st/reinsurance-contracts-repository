(the &ldquo;<U>Information Party</U>&rdquo;) believes in good faith, based upon legal advice (from internal or external counsel),
that the delivery of any information or documents pursuant to this Agreement would cause the loss of any applicable privilege or

means of delivering the requested information or documents, or the substance thereof, that does not result in the loss of such

to enter into a common interest agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as <U>Annex A</U>, (a &ldquo;<U>Common Interest
Agreement</U>&rdquo;) in advance of, and as a condition to, such delivery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no alternate means can
be agreed by the parties and external counsel to the Information Party informs the other Party in writing that a common interest
cannot be established, or with sufficient confidence be asserted, to preserve the privilege or protection from disclosure with
respect to the information or documents in question, even if a Common Interest Agreement were to be entered into, or that for any
other reason the information or documents cannot be delivered without loss of the privilege or protection from disclosure (such
counsel to explain the reasons for its conclusion briefly but in reasonable detail so that the other Party can review the legal
analysis with its own counsel), then the Information Party is excused from providing such information or documents but only to the

to direct the Parties to request that any court modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary relief issued by such court, and to award
damages for the failure of any Party to respect the arbitral tribunal&rsquo;s orders to that effect. The Parties agree that any ruling
by the arbitral tribunal on interim measures shall be deemed to be a final award with respect to the subject matter of the ruling and
shall be fully enforceable as such. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware solely
in respect of any proceeding relating to or in aid of an arbitration under this Agreement. Each Party unconditionally and irrevocably
waives any objections which they may have now or in the future to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for this purpose, including
objections by reason of lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue or inconvenient forum. Nothing in this paragraph limits the scope
of the Parties&rsquo; agreement to arbitrate or the power of the arbitral tribunal to determine the scope of its own jurisdiction.</P>
