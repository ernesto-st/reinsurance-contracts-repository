Branch, as Agent of such Lender to act as specified herein and in the other Loan Documents, and
each such Lender hereby authorizes the Agent, as the agent for such Lender, to take such action on
its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated by the terms hereof and of the other Loan
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, including but not
limited to the appointing of the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement. Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary elsewhere herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and therein, or any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, or shall otherwise exist against the Agent. In performing its functions and duties
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall act solely as an agent of the
Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship
of agency or trust with or for any Facility Party. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing two sentences, the use of the term &#147;agent&#148; herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely
as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties. The provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;X</U>
(other than <U>Section&nbsp;10.09</U>) are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and none
of the Facility Parties nor the Collateral Agent shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary

of and for the benefit of such Lender or otherwise and to require the delivery of any Collateral

applicable usury law from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof such Persons stipulate
and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in the Loan Documents shall ever be
construed to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in
excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by Applicable Law from time to
time in effect (the &#147;<U>Maximum Rate</U>&#148;). Neither any Facility Party nor any present or future
guarantors, endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of any Credit
Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be required to pay
interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be lawfully charged under Applicable Law
from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this <U>Section</U> shall control over all
other provisions of the Loan Documents which may be in conflict or apparent conflict herewith. The
Lenders and the Agent expressly disavow any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned
interest or finance charges in the event the maturity of any Credit Obligation is accelerated. If
(i)&nbsp;the maturity of any Credit Obligation is accelerated for any reason, (ii)&nbsp;any Credit Obligation
is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to constitute interest are determined to be in excess
of the legal maximum, or (iii)&nbsp;any Lender of any other holder of any or all of the Credit
Obligations shall otherwise collect moneys which are determined to constitute interest which would
otherwise increase the interest on any or all of the Credit Obligations to an amount in excess of
that permitted to be charged by Applicable Law then in effect, then all sums determined to
constitute interest in excess of such legal limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to
reduce the then outstanding principal of the related Credit Obligations or, at such Lender&#146;s or
holder&#146;s option, promptly returned to the Borrower or the other payor thereof upon such
determination. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific
circumstance, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under Applicable Law, the Agent, the Lenders and
the Facility Parties (and any other payors thereof) shall to the greatest extent permitted under
Applicable Law, (i)&nbsp;characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather
than as interest, (ii)&nbsp;exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii)&nbsp;amortize,
prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term
of the instruments evidencing the Credit Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding
from time to time thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in effect
under Applicable Law in order to lawfully charge the maximum amount of interest permitted under
Applicable Law. In the event Applicable Law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter&nbsp;303 of
the Texas Finance Code (the &#147;<U>Texas Finance Code</U>&#148;) as amended, for that day, the ceiling
shall be the &#147;weekly ceiling&#148; as defined in the Texas Finance Code; <U>provided</U> that if any
Applicable Law permits greater interest, the Law permitting the greatest interest shall apply. As
