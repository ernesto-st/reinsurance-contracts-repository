     2.01 AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS. (a) Each Lender severally agrees, on
the terms and conditions set forth herein, to make loans to the Company (each
such loan, a "REVOLVING LOAN") from time to time on any Business Day during the
period from the Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date, in an aggregate
amount not to exceed at any time the total of the amounts set forth on SCHEDULE
2.01 (such total amount, as the same may be reduced


                                       29
<PAGE>

under SECTION 2.05 or as a result of one or more assignments under SECTION
10.08, the Lender's "REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT"); PROVIDED, however, that, after
giving effect to any Borrowing of Revolving Loans (exclusive of Revolving Loans,
Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations which are repaid with the proceeds of, and
simultaneously with the incurrence of, the respective incurrence of Revolving
Loans), the Effective Amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans, Swing Line
Loans and L/C Obligations, shall not at any time exceed the Maximum Revolver
Amount; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that the Effective Amount of the Revolving Loans
of any Lender plus the participation of such Lender in the Effective Amount of
all Swing Loan Loans and L/C Obligations shall not at any time exceed such
Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's Revolving
Loan Commitment, and subject to Availability at such time and the other terms
and conditions hereof, the Company may borrow under this SECTION 2.01(a), prepay
under SECTION 2.06 and reborrow under this SECTION 2.01(a).

          (b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Bank
agrees to make loans to the Company (each such loan, a "SWING LINE LOAN") from
time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date to the
Swing Line Termination Date in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding not to exceed $10,000,000 (the "SWING LINE LOAN COMMITMENT");
PROVIDED, after giving effect to any Borrowing of Swing Line Loans, the
Effective Amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans shall not at any time
exceed the Swing Line Loan Commitment; AND PROVIDED FURTHER, that the Effective
Amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations
shall not at any time exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount. Prior to the Swing
Line Termination Date, the Company may use the Swing Line Loan Commitment by
borrowing, prepaying the Swing Line Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing,
all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. All Swing Line Loans
shall bear interest at the Swing Line Rate and shall not be entitled to be
converted into Loans that bear interest at any other rate.

          (c) INCREASE OF REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT. (i) At any time, the
Company may request (in consultation with the Agent) that the combined Revolving
Loan Commitment be increased in a minimum amount equal to, and in minimum
increments of, $1,000,000, PROVIDED that, (A) the combined Revolving Loan
=Commitment shall at no time exceed $80,000,000 and (B) the Company shall not
previously have reduced the combined Revolving Loan Commitment. Such request
shall be made in a written notice given to the Agent and the Lenders by the
Company not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the proposed effective
date of such increase, which notice (a "COMMITMENT INCREASE NOTICE") shall
specify the amount of the proposed increase in the combined Revolving Loan
Commitment and the proposed effective date of such increase. In the event of
such a Commitment Increase Notice, each of the Lenders shall be given the
opportunity to participate in the requested increase. No Lender shall have any
obligation to increase its Commitment pursuant to a Commitment Increase Notice.
On or prior to the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the
Commitment Increase Notice, each Lender shall submit to the Agent a notice
indicating the maximum amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment
in connection with such Commitment Increase Notice (any such notice to the Agent
being herein a "LENDER INCREASE NOTICE"). Any Lender which does not submit a
Lender Increase Notice to the Agent prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15)
Business Day period shall be deemed to have denied any increase in its
Commitment. In the event that the increases of Commitments set forth in the
Lender Increase Notices exceed the amount requested by the Company in the
Commitment Increase Notice, the Agent and the Arranger shall have the


                                       30
<PAGE>

right, in consultation with the Company, to allocate the amount of increases
necessary to meet the Company's Commitment Increase Notice. In the event that
the Lender Increase Notices are less than the amount requested by the Company,
not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed effective date the
Company may notify the Agent of any financial institution that shall have agreed
to become a "Lender" party hereto (a "PROPOSED NEW LENDER") in connection with
the Commitment Increase Notice. Any Proposed New Lender shall be subject to the
consent of the Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
Company shall not have arranged any Proposed New Lender(s) to commit to the
shortfall from the Lender Increase Notices, then the Company shall be deemed to
have reduced the amount of its Commitment Increase Notice to the aggregate
amount set forth in the Lender Increase Notices. Based upon the Lender Increase
Notices, any allocations made in connection therewith and any notice regarding
any Proposed New Lender, if applicable, the Agent shall notify the Company and
the Lenders on or before the Business Day immediately prior to the proposed
effective date of the amount of each Lender's and Proposed New Lenders'
Commitment (the "EFFECTIVE COMMITMENT AMOUNT") and the amount of the combined
Revolving Loan Commitment, which amount shall be effective on the following
Business Day. Any increase in the combined Revolving Loan Commitment shall be
subject to the following conditions precedent: (1) the Company shall have
obtained from each Subsidiary party to a Loan Document its reaffirmation of such
Loan Documents, if any, executed by it, which consent and reaffirmation shall be
in writing and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, (2)
as of the date of the Commitment Increase Notice and as of the proposed
effective date of the increase in the combined Revolving Loan Commitment, all
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material
respects as though made on such date (except to the extent such representation
or warranties expressly refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be
true and correct as of such earlier date) and no event shall have occurred and
then be continuing which constitutes a Default or Event of Default, (3) the
Company, the Agent and each Proposed New Lender or Lender that shall have agreed
to provide a "Commitment" in support of such increase in the combined Revolving
Loan Commitment shall have executed and delivered a "COMMITMENT AND ACCEPTANCE"
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT H hereto, (4) counsel for the Company and
for any such guarantors shall have provided to the Agent supplemental opinions
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and (5) the Company
and the Proposed New Lender shall otherwise have executed and delivered such
other instruments and documents as are consistent with those required under
ARTICLE V or that the Agent shall have reasonably requested in connection with
such increase. If any fee shall be charged by the Buying Lenders (as defined
below) in connection with any such increase, such fee shall be in accordance
with then prevailing market conditions, which market conditions shall have been
reasonably documented by the Agent to the Company. Upon satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to any increase in the combined Revolving Loan Commitment,
the Agent shall promptly advise the Company and each Lender of the effective
date of such increase. Upon the effective date of any increase in the combined
Revolving Loan Commitment that is provided by a Proposed New Lender, such
Proposed New Lender shall be a party to this Agreement as a Lender and shall
have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein
shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any
Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder at any time.

          (ii) For purposes of this CLAUSE (ii), (A) the term "BUYING LENDER(S)"
shall mean (1) each Lender the Effective Commitment Amount of which is greater
than its


                                       31
<PAGE>

Commitment prior to the effective date of any increase in the combined
Revolving Loan Commitment and (2) each Proposed New Lender that is allocated an
Effective Commitment Amount in connection with any Commitment Increase Notice,
and (B) the term "SELLING LENDER(S)" shall mean each Lender whose Commitment is
not being increased from that in effect prior to such increase in the combined
Revolving Loan Commitment. Effective on the effective date of any increase in
the combined Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to CLAUSE (i) above, each
Selling Lender hereby sells, grants, assigns and conveys to each Buying Lender,
without recourse, warranty, or representation of any kind, except as
specifically provided herein, an undivided percentage in such Selling Lender's
right, title and interest in and to its outstanding Loans in the respective
dollar amounts and percentages necessary so that, from and after such sale, each
such Selling Lender's outstanding Loans shall equal such Selling Lender's Pro
Rata Share (calculated based upon the Effective Commitment Amounts) of the
outstanding Loans. Effective on the effective date of the increase in the
combined Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to CLAUSE (i) above, each Buying
Lender hereby purchases and accepts such grant, assignment and conveyance from
the Selling Lenders. Each Buying Lender hereby agrees that its respective
purchase price for the portion of the outstanding Loans purchased hereby shall
equal the respective dollar amount necessary so that, from and after such
payments, each Buying Lender's outstanding Loans shall equal such Buying
Lender's Pro Rata Share (calculated based upon the Effective Commitment Amounts)
of the outstanding Loans. Such amount shall be payable on the effective date of
the increase in the combined Revolving Loan Commitment by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Agent. The Agent, in turn, shall wire
transfer any such funds received to the Selling Lenders, in same day funds, for
the sole account of the Selling Lenders. Each Selling Lender hereby represents
and warrants to each Buying Lender that such Selling Lender owns the Loans being
sold and assigned hereby for its own account and has not sold, transferred or
encumbered any or all of its interest in such Loans, except for participations
which will be extinguished upon payment to Selling Lender of an amount equal to
the portion of the outstanding Loans being sold by such Selling Lender. Each
Buying Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except for each Selling
Lender's representations and warranties contained in the foregoing sentence,
each such Buying Lender has entered into its Commitment and Acceptance with
respect to such increase on the basis of its own independent investigation and
has not relied upon, and will not rely upon, any explicit or implicit written or
oral representation, warranty or other statement of the Lenders or the Agent
concerning the authorization, execution, legality, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. The Company hereby agrees to compensate each Lender for all losses,
expenses and liabilities incurred by each Lender in connection with the sale and
assignment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan hereunder on the terms and in the manner
as set forth in SECTION 4.04.

     2.02 LOAN ACCOUNTS.

          (a) The Loans made by each Lender and the Letters of Credit Issued by
the Issuing Bank shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records
maintained by such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in the ordinary
course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Agent, the Issuing
Bank and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of the Loans
made by the Lenders to the Company, and the Letters of Credit issued for the
account of the Company, and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so to
record or


                                       32
<PAGE>

any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Company hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Loans or any Letter of Credit.

          (b) Upon the request of any Lender made through the Agent, the Loans
made by such Lender may be evidenced by one or more Notes, instead of or in
addition to loan accounts. Each such Lender shall record on the schedules
annexed to its Note(s) the date, amount and maturity of each Loan made by it and
the amount of each payment of principal made by the Company with respect
thereto. Each such Lender is irrevocably authorized by the Company to make such
recordations on its Note(s) and each Lender's record shall be deemed prima facie
correct; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure of a Lender to make, or an error in
making, a notation thereon with respect to any Loan shall not limit or otherwise
affect the obligations of the Company hereunder or under any such Note to such
Lender.

     2.03 PROCEDURE FOR BORROWING.

          (a) REVOLVING LOANS. (i) Each Borrowing (other than a L/C Borrowing or
a Borrowing of Swing Line Loans) shall be made upon the Company's irrevocable
written notice delivered to the Agent in the form of a Notice of Borrowing
(which notice must be received by the Agent prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time)
(x) three Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of
Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) on the date of the requested Borrowing Date, in
the case of Base Rate Loans, specifying:

               (1) the amount of the Borrowing, which shall be in an aggregate
          minimum amount of $500,000, or any multiple of $100,000 in excess
          thereof, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and $1,000,000, or any
          multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Eurodollar Rate
          Loans;

               (2) the requested Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day;

               (3) the Type of Loans comprising the Borrowing; and

               (4) the duration of the Interest Period applicable to such
          Eurodollar Rate Loans included in such notice. If the Notice of
          Borrowing fails to specify the duration of the Interest Period for any
          Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Interest Period
          shall be one month;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to the Borrowing to be made on the Closing
Date, the Notice of Borrowing shall be delivered to the Agent not later than
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Closing Date and such Borrowing will consist of
Base Rate Loans only.

          (ii) The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of any
Notice of Borrowing and of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of that
Borrowing.

          (iii) Each Lender will make the amount of its Pro Rata Share of each
Borrowing available to the Agent for the account of the Company at the Agent's
Payment Office by 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Borrowing Date requested by
the Company in funds immediately available to the Agent. The proceeds of all
such Loans will then be made available to the Company by the Agent at such
office by crediting the account of the Company on the


                                       33
<PAGE>

books of Bank of America with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the Agent.

          (iv) After giving effect to any Borrowing, unless the Agent shall
otherwise consent, there may not be more than seven different Interest Periods
in effect.

          (b) SWING LINE LOANS. (i) The Company may borrow under the Swing Line
Loan Commitment on any Business Day until the Swing Line Termination Date;
PROVIDED that the Company shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (which notice
must be received by the Agent prior to 12:00 noon (Chicago time)) and the Agent
shall promptly deliver to the Company and the Swing Line Bank a confirmation of
such notice specifying the amount of the requested Swing Line Loan, which shall
be in a minimum amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof. The proceeds of the Swing Line Loan will be made available by the Swing
Line Bank to the Company in immediately available funds at the office of the
Swing Line Bank by 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of such notice. The
Company may at any time and from time to time, prepay the Swing Line Loans, in
whole or in part, without premium or penalty, by notifying the Agent prior to
12:00 noon (Chicago time) on any Business Day of the date and amount of
prepayment. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice
shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Partial prepayments
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof.

          (ii) The Agent, acting upon the demand of the Swing Line Bank, at any
time in the Swing Line Bank's sole and absolute discretion, shall on behalf of
the Company (which hereby irrevocably directs the Agent to so act on its behalf)
notify each Lender (including the Swing Line Bank) to make a Revolving Loan to
the Company in a principal amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such Swing Line Loan, unless any Lender or Lenders shall be obligated,
pursuant to SECTION 2.01(a), to make funds available to the Agent on the date
such notice is given in an aggregate amount equal to or in excess of such Swing
Line Loan, in which case such funds shall be applied by the Agent first to repay
such Swing Line Loan and any remaining funds shall be made available to the
Company in accordance with SECTION 2.01(a); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such notice
shall be deemed to have automatically been given upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default under SECTION 9.01(f) or (g). Upon notice from the Agent, following
any demand by the Swing Line Bank each Lender (other than the Swing Line Bank)
will immediately transfer to the Agent, for transfer to the Swing Line Bank, in
immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the amount of such Swing Line Loan so repaid. Each Lender's obligation to
transfer the amount of such Revolving Loan to the Agent shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without
limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender or any other Person may have against the Swing Line Bank, (ii)
the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the
termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment, (iii) any adverse change in the
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any other Person, (iv) any
breach of this Agreement by the Company or any other Person or (v) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing.

          (iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Swing Line
Bank (i) shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loan if the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE V have


                                       34
<PAGE>

not been satisfied and (ii) shall not make any requested Swing Line Loan if,
prior to 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of such requested Swing Line Loan,
it has received a written notice from the Agent or any Lender directing it not
to make further Swing Line Loans because one or more of the conditions specified
in ARTICLE V are not then satisfied.

          (iv) If prior to the making of a Loan required to be made by SECTION
2.03(b)(ii) an Event of Default described in SECTION 9.01(f) or 9.01(g) shall
have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Company, each Lender will,
on the date such Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice described in
SECTION 2.03(b)(ii), purchase an undivided participating interest in the
outstanding Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the
aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Each Lender
will immediately transfer to the Agent for the benefit of the Swing Line Bank,
in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation.

                  (v) Whenever, at any time after a Lender has purchased a
participating interest in a Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Bank receives any
payment on account thereof, the Swing Line Bank will distribute to the Agent for
delivery to each Lender its participating interest in such amount (appropriately
adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during
which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding and funded);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that such payment received by the Swing
Line Bank is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Agent for
delivery to the Swing Line Bank any portion thereof previously distributed by
the Swing Line Bank to it.

          (vi) Each Lender's obligation to make the Loans referred to in SECTION
2.03(b)(ii) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to SECTION
2.03(b)(iv) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or the Company may have
against the Swing Line Bank, the Company or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of
Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Company, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the
Company, any Subsidiary or any other Lender, or (v) any other circumstance,
happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

     2.04 CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION ELECTIONS.

          (a) The Company may, upon irrevocable written notice to the Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this SECTION 2.04:

               (i) elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Loans
          (other than Swing Line Loans), or as of the last day of the applicable
          Interest Period, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, to convert any
          such Loans (or any part thereof in an aggregate minimum amount of
          $500,000, or any multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, in the case
          of Base Rate Loans, and $1,000,000, or any multiple of $500,000 in
          excess thereof, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans) into Loans of
          any other Type; or


                                       35
<PAGE>

               (ii) elect as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
          to continue any Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such day (or
          any part thereof in an amount not less than $1,000,000, or that is in
          an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof);

PROVIDED, that if at any time the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans in
respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of
part thereof to be less than $1,000,000, such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
automatically convert into Base Rate Loans, and on and after such date the right
of the Company to continue such Loans as, and convert such Loans into,
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall terminate.

          (b) The Company shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to
be received by the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least
(i) three Business Days in advance of the Conversion/ Continuation Date, if the
Loans are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans and (ii) on
the date of the Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be converted
into Base Rate Loans, specifying:

               (i) the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date;

               (ii) the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or continued;

               (iii) the Type of Loans resulting from the proposed conversion or
          continuation; and

               (iv) other than in the case of conversions into Base Rate Loans,
          the duration of the requested Interest Period.

          (c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Company has failed to submit or complete a notice in
accordance with SECTION 2.04(b), the Company shall be deemed to have elected to
convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans into a one month Eurodollar Rate Loan,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if any Default or Event of Default then exits, the Company
shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans into a
Base Rate Loan.

          (d) The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, or, if no timely notice is provided by the
Company, the Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the details of any
automatic continuation or conversion. All conversions and continuations shall be
made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the
Loans, with respect to which the notice was given, held by each Lender.

          (e) Unless the Majority Lenders otherwise consent, during the
existence of a Default or Event of Default, the Company may not elect to have a
Loan converted into or continued as an Eurodollar Rate Loan.

          (f) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, unless the Agent shall otherwise consent, there may not
be more than seven different Interest Periods in effect.

     2.05 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Company may,
upon not less than three Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent,
terminate the Commitments, or permanently reduce the Commitments by an aggregate

UNLESS, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of Revolving Loans
made on the effective date thereof, (i) the Effective Amount of all Revolving
Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations would exceed the amount of the
Commitments then in effect, (ii) the Effective Amount of all Swing Line Loans
then outstanding would exceed the Swing Line Loan Commitment or (iii) the
Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment. If and
to the extent specified by the Company in the notice to the Agent, some or all
of the reduction in the Commitments shall be applied to reduce the L/C
Commitment. Once reduced in accordance with this Section, the Commitments may
not be increased. Any reduction of the Commitments shall be applied to each
Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All accrued Commitment Fees and letter
of credit fees to, but not including, the effective date of any reduction or
termination of the Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such
reduction or termination.

     2.06 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Subject to SECTION 4.04, the Company may, at any
time or from time to time, upon irrevocable notice to the Agent by 10:00 a.m.
Chicago time, prepay Loans ratably among the Lenders in whole or in part without
penalty, in minimum amounts of $500,000, or any multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and $500,000, or any multiple of
$500,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Such notice of
prepayment shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s)
of Loans to be prepaid. The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its
receipt of any such notice, and of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall make such
prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to each
such date on the amount prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to SECTION
4.04.

     2.07 MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS.

          (a) The Company shall promptly, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans or
Swing Line Loans on any date on which the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of such Loans together with the Effective Amount of the L/C Obligations (after
giving effect to any other repayments or prepayments on such day) exceeds the
Maximum Revolver Amount in the amount of such excess, or if any such excess
remains after a prepayment in full hereunder of all outstanding Loans, the
Company shall Cash Collaterialize the outstanding Letters of Credit to the
extent of such remaining excess.

          (b) If on any date the Effective Amount of L/C Obligations exceeds the
L/C Commitment, the Company shall Cash Collateralize on such date the
outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal to the excess of the maximum
amount then available to be drawn under the Letters of Credit over the Aggregate
L/C Commitment.

          (c) GENERAL. Any prepayments pursuant to this SECTION 2.07 shall be
applied first to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to Eurodollar
Rate Loans with the shortest Interest Periods remaining. The Company shall pay,
together with each prepayment


                                       37
<PAGE>

under this SECTION 2.07, accrued interest on the amount prepaid and any amounts
required pursuant to SECTION 4.04.

     2.08 REPAYMENT.

          (a) The Company shall repay to the Lenders on the Revolving
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding
on such date.

          (b) SWING LINE LOANS. The Company shall repay to the Swing Line Bank
on the Swing Line Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Swing Line
Loans outstanding on such date.

     2.09 INTEREST.

          (a) Each Loan (other than Swing Line Loans) shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a
rate per annum equal to either the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate, as the case
may be, PLUS the Applicable Margin (and subject to the Company's right to
convert to other Types of Loans under SECTION 2.04). Swing Line Loans shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
Borrowing Date at a rate per annum equal to the Swing Line Rate.

          (b) Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date. Interest shall also be paid on the date of any prepayment of Loans
under SECTION 2.06 or 2.07 for the portion of the Loans so prepaid and upon
payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and, during the existence of any
Event of Default, interest shall be paid on demand of the Agent at the request
or with the consent of the Majority Lenders.

          (c) Notwithstanding SECTION 2.09(a), while any Event of Default exists
or after acceleration, the Company shall pay interest (after as well as before
entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal
amount of all outstanding Obligations, at a rate per annum which is determined
by adding 2% per annum to the Applicable Margin then in effect for such Loans;
and in the case of Obligations not subject to an Applicable Margin, at a rate
per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2%; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, on and after
the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan
outstanding on the date of occurrence of such Event of Default or acceleration,
the principal amount of such Loan shall, during the continuation of such Event
of Default or after acceleration, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate plus 2% (the "DEFAULT RATE").

          (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations
of the Company to any Lender hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that
payments of interest shall not be required for any period for which interest is
computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for
or receiving such payment by such Lender would be contrary to the provisions of
any law applicable to such Lender limiting the highest rate of interest that may
be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Lender, and in such
event the Company shall pay such Lender interest at the highest rate permitted
by applicable law.



                                       38

     2.10 FEES.

          (a) AGENCY FEES. The Company shall pay the fees to the Agent for the
Agent's own account, as required by the letter agreement ("FEE LETTER") between
the Company and the Agent, dated as of August 5, 2002.

          (b) COMMITMENT FEES. The Company shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender a commitment fee ("COMMITMENT FEE") on the average daily
unused portion of such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, computed on a
quarterly basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
based upon the daily utilization for that quarter as calculated by the Agent, at
the Applicable Margin per annum. For purposes of calculating utilization under
this Section, the Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed used to the extent
of the Effective Amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding, PLUS the Effective
Amount of L/C Obligations then outstanding but excluding for the purposes of
calculating utilization under this Section the Effective Amount of Swing Line
Loans. Such commitment fee shall accrue from the Closing Date to the Revolving
Termination Date and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each March, June, September and December through the Revolving
Termination Date, with the final payment to be made on the Revolving Termination
Date; provided that, in connection with any reduction or termination of
Revolving Loan Commitment under SECTION 2.05, the accrued commitment fee
calculated for the period ending on such date shall also be paid on the date of
such reduction or termination, with the following quarterly payment being
calculated on the basis of the period from such reduction or termination date to
such quarterly payment date. The commitment fees provided in this Section shall
accrue at all times after the above-mentioned commencement date, including at
any time during which one or more conditions in Article V are not met.

     2.11 COMPUTATION OF FEES AND INTEREST.

          (a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base
Rate is determined by Bank of America's "reference rate" shall be made on the
basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.
All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a
360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid
than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest and fees shall accrue
during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from the
first day thereof to the last day thereof.

          (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent shall be
conclusive and binding on the Company and the Lenders and shall be prima facie
evidence of such interest rate. The Agent will, at the request of the Company or
any Lender, deliver to the Company or the Lender, as the case may be, a
statement showing the quotations used by the Agent in determining any interest
rate and the resulting interest rate.



                                       39

     2.12 PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY.

          (a) All payments to be made by the Company shall be made without
set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all payments by the Company shall be made to the Agent for the account
of the Lenders at the Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in dollars and
in immediately available funds, (i) solely for the purpose of calculating the
accrual of interest on the outstanding Obligations, no later than 12:00 Noon
(Chicago time) on the date specified herein and (ii) for all other purposes, no
later than 5:00 PM (Chicago time) on the date specified herein. The Agent will
promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share
as expressly provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received. Any
payment received by the Agent later than the time specified herein shall be
deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable
interest or fees shall continue to accrue for the day actually received.

          (b) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest
Period" herein, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as
the case may be.

          (c) Unless the Agent receives notice from the Company prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Company will not make
such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the Company
has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available
funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Company has not made such
payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on demand
such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date repaid.

     2.13 PAYMENTS BY THE LENDERS TO THE AGENT.

          (a) Unless the Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the
Closing Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Closing Date, at least
one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not
make available as and when required hereunder to the Agent for the account of
the Company the amount of that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the
Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to the Agent in
immediately available funds on the Borrowing Date and the Agent may (but shall
not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Lender
shall not have made its full amount available to the Agent in immediately
available funds and the Agent in such circumstances has made available to the
Company such amount, that Lender shall on the Business Day following such
Borrowing Date make such amount available to the Agent, together with interest
at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such period. A notice of the Agent
submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this clause (a)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made available,
such payment to the Agent shall constitute such Lender's Loan on the date of
Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made
available to the Agent on the Business Day following the Borrowing


                                       40
<PAGE>

Date, the Agent will notify the Company of such failure to fund and, upon demand
by the Agent, the Company shall pay such amount to the Agent for the Agent's
account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of
such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the
time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

          (b) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any Borrowing Date
shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on
such Borrowing Date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on any Borrowing
Date.

     2.14 SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder), such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Agent of
such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the
Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment pro rata with each of them; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the
purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each
other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid
therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off, but subject to SECTION 11.10) with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of
such participation. The Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments.

                                  ARTICLE III

                              THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

     3.01 THE LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

          (a) On the terms and conditions set forth herein (i) the Issuing Bank
agrees, (A) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date to issue Letters of Credit for
the account of the Company, and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously
issued by it, in accordance with SECTIONS 3.02(C) and (d), and (B) to honor
drafts under the Letters of Credit; and (ii) the Lenders severally agree to
participate in Letters of Credit Issued for the account of the Company;
PROVIDED, that the Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to Issue, and no Lender
shall be obligated to participate in, any Letter of Credit if as of the date of
Issuance of such Letter of Credit (the "ISSUANCE DATE") (1) the Effective Amount
of all L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans plus the Effective Amount of all
Revolving Loans exceeds the Maximum Revolver Amount, (2) the participation of
any Lender in the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans
plus the


                                       41
<PAGE>

Effective Amount of the Revolving Loans of such Lender exceeds such Lender's
Revolving Loan Commitment or (3) the Effective Amount of L/C Obligations exceeds
the L/C Commitment. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms
and conditions hereof, the Company's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall
be fully revolving, and, accordingly, the Company may, during the foregoing
period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit which have expired
or which have been drawn upon and reimbursed.

          (b) The Issuing Bank is under no obligation to Issue any Letter of
Credit if:

               (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
     or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing
     Bank from Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law
     applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not
     having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
     over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank
     refrain from, the Issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
     Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to
     such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for
     which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in
     effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any
     unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing
     Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it;

               (ii) the Issuing Bank has received written notice from any
     Lender, the Agent or the Company, on or prior to the Business Day prior to
     the requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one or more
     of the applicable conditions contained in ARTICLE V is not then satisfied;

               (iii) the expiry date of any requested Letter of Credit is after
     the Revolving Termination Date, unless the Company has Cash Collateralized,
     in form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, its L/C Obligations
     under such Letter of Credit on or prior to the date of the Issuance of such
     Letter of Credit;

               (iv) any requested Letter of Credit does not provide for drafts,
     or is not otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
     Issuing Bank, or the Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall violate any
     applicable policies of the Issuing Bank; or

               (v) such Letter of Credit is in a face amount less than $25,000,
     unless such lesser amount is approved by the Agent and the Issuing Bank, or
     is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars.

     3.02 ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT AND RENEWAL OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

          (a) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon the irrevocable written
request of the Company received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the
Company to the Agent) at least three days (or such shorter time as the Issuing
Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the
proposed date of issuance. Each such request for issuance of a Letter of Credit
shall be by facsimile, confirmed immediately in an original writing, in the form
of an L/C Application, and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the
Issuing Bank: (i) the proposed date of issuance of the Letter of Credit (which
shall be a Business Day); (ii) the face


                                       42
<PAGE>

amount of the Letter of Credit; (iii) the expiry date of the Letter of Credit;
(iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be
presented by the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit in case of any drawing
thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be presented by the
beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as
the Issuing Bank may require.

          (b) Prior to the Issuance of any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank
will confirm with the Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Agent has
received a copy of the L/C Application or L/C Amendment Application from the
Company and, if not, the Issuing Bank will provide the Agent with a copy
thereof. Unless the Issuing Bank has received notice on or before the Business
Day the Issuing Bank is to issue a requested Letter of Credit from the Agent (A)
directing the Issuing Bank not to issue such Letter of Credit because such
issuance is not then permitted under SECTION 3.01(a) as a result of the
limitations set forth in clauses (1) through (3) thereof or SECTION 3.01(b)(ii);
or (B) that one or more conditions specified in Article V are not then
satisfied; then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Bank
shall, with the written approval of the Agent, on the requested date, issue a
Letter of Credit for the account of the Company in accordance with the Issuing
Bank's usual and customary business practices.

          (c) From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and
prior to the Revolving Termination Date, the Issuing Bank will, upon the written
request of the Company received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the
Company to the Agent) at least three days (or such shorter time as the Issuing
Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the
proposed date of amendment, amend any Letter of Credit issued by it. Each such
request for amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile,
confirmed immediately in an original writing, made in the form of an L/C
Amendment Application and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the
Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (ii) the proposed date of
amendment of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the
nature of the proposed amendment; and (iv) such other matters as the Issuing
Bank may require. The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any
Letter of Credit if: (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time
to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms of this
Agreement; or (B) the beneficiary of any such letter of Credit does not accept
the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. The Agent will promptly notify
the Lenders of the receipt by it of any L/C Application or L/C Amendment
Application.

          (d) The Issuing Bank and the Lenders agree that, while a Letter of
Credit is outstanding and prior to the Revolving Termination Date, at the option
of the Company and upon the written request of the Company received by the
Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the Company to the Agent) at least five days
(or such shorter time as the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in
its sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of notification of renewal, the
Issuing Bank shall be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal of any Letter
of Credit issued by it. Each such request for renewal of a Letter of Credit
shall be made by facsimile, confirmed immediately in an original writing, in the
form of an L/C Amendment Application, and shall specify in form and detail
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to be renewed; (ii)
the proposed date of notification of renewal of the Letter of Credit (which
shall be a Business Day); (iii) the revised expiry date of the Letter of Credit;
and (iv) such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require. The Issuing Bank
shall be under no obligation so to renew any Letter of Credit if: (A) the
Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue or amend


                                       43
<PAGE>

such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms of this Agreement; or
(B) the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed
renewal of the Letter of Credit. If any outstanding Letter of Credit shall
provide that it shall be automatically renewed unless the beneficiary thereof
receives notice from the Issuing Bank that such Letter of Credit shall not be
renewed, and if at the time of renewal the Issuing Bank would be entitled to
authorize the automatic renewal of such Letter of Credit in accordance with this
clause (d) upon the request of the Company but the Issuing Bank shall not have
received any L/C Amendment Application from the Company with respect to such
renewal or other written direction by the Company with respect thereto, the
Issuing Bank shall nonetheless be permitted to allow such Letter of Credit to
renew, and the Company and the Lenders hereby authorize such renewal, and,
accordingly, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have received an L/C Amendment
Application from the Company requesting such renewal.

          (e) The Issuing Bank may, at its election (or as required by the Agent
at the direction of the Majority Lenders), deliver any notices of termination or
other communications to any Letter of Credit beneficiary or transferee, and take
any other action as necessary or appropriate, at any time and from time to time,
in order to cause the expiry date of such Letter of Credit to be a date not
later than the Revolving Termination Date.

          (f) This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict with any
L/C-Related Document (other than any Letter of Credit).

          (g) The Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Agent (and the Agent
shall deliver a copy to each Lender), concurrently or promptly following its
delivery of a Letter of Credit, or amendment to or renewal of a Letter of
Credit, to an advising lender or a beneficiary, a true and complete copy of each
such Letter of Credit or amendment to or renewal of a Letter of Credit.

     3.03 RISK PARTICIPATIONS, DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENTS.

          (a) Immediately upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
purchase from the Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit and each
drawing thereunder in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Pro Rata Share
of such Lender, times (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. For purposes of
SECTION 2.10(b), each Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to utilize
the Commitment of each Lender by an amount equal to the amount of such
participation.

          (b) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify
the Company and the Agent. The Company shall reimburse the Issuing Bank (by an
L/C Borrowing or otherwise) prior to 12:00 Noon (Chicago time), on each date
that any amount is paid by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each
such date, an "HONOR DATE"), in an amount equal to the amount so paid by the
Issuing Bank. In the event the Company fails to reimburse the Issuing Bank for
the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 Noon (Chicago
time) on the Honor Date, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Agent and the
Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Company shall be deemed
to have requested that Base Rate Loans


                                       44
<PAGE>
in an aggregate amount equal to the unreimbursed drawing be made by the Lenders
to be disbursed on the Honor Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to
Availability and subject to the conditions set forth in SECTION 5.02. Any notice
given by the Issuing Bank or the Agent pursuant to this clause (b) may be given
by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing (including by facsimile);
PROVIDED that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the
conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

          (c) Each Lender (including the Lender acting as Issuing Bank) shall
upon any notice pursuant to SECTION 3.03(b) make available to the Agent for the
account of the relevant Issuing Bank an amount in Dollars and in immediately
available funds equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount of the drawing,
whereupon the participating Lenders that so make funds available shall (subject
to SECTION 3.03(d)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan consisting of a
Base Rate Loan to the Company in that amount. With respect to any unreimbursed
drawing that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Loan consisting of Base Rate
Loans because the conditions set forth in SECTION 5.02 cannot be satisfied, the
lack of sufficient Availability or for any other reason, the Company shall be
deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing in the amount of
the unreimbursed drawing that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be
due and payable on demand by the Agent or the Issuing Bank (together with
interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each
Lender's payment to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to
this SECTION 3.03(c) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in
such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in
satisfaction of its participation obligation under this SECTION 3.03. Until each
Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this SECTION 3.03(c)
to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit,
interest in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be
solely for the account of the Issuing Bank. The Agent shall remit the funds so
received to the Issuing Bank. If any Lender so notified fails to make available
to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank the amount of such Lender's Pro
Rata Share of the amount of the drawing by no later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago
time) on the Honor Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation
to make such payment, from the Honor Date to the date such Lender makes such
payment, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time
to time during such period. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted to any
Lender (through the Agent) with respects to any amounts owing under this Section
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Agent will promptly give notice
of the occurrence of the Honor Date, but failure of the Agent to give any such
notice on the Honor Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect
such payment on such date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligations
under this SECTION 3.03.

          (d) Each Lender's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make
the Revolving Loans or to fund its L/C Advances, as contemplated by this SECTION
3.03, as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute and
unconditional and without recourse to the Issuing Bank and shall not be affected
by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing Bank, the
Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or
continuance of a Default, an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or
(iii) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Lender's
obligation to make Revolving Loans under this SECTION 3.03 (but not its
obligation to fund L/C Advances) is subject to Availability and the conditions


                                       45
<PAGE>

set forth in SECTION 5.02 (other than delivery by the Company of a Borrowing
Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the
obligation of the Company to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of any
payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with
interest as provided herein.

     3.04 REPAYMENT OF PARTICIPATIONS.

          (a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank of immediately available funds from the Company (i) in
reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under the Letter of Credit
with respect to which any Lender has paid the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank for such Lender's participation in the Letter of Credit pursuant to
SECTION 3.03 or (ii) in payment of interest thereon, the Agent will pay to each
Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank, the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such funds, and the
Issuing Bank shall receive the amount of the Pro Rata Share of such funds of any
Lender that did not so pay the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank.

          (b) If the Agent or the Issuing Bank is required at any time to return
to the Company, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any
official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made by the
Company to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to SECTION
3.04(a) in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or
interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Agent, forthwith
return to the Agent or the Issuing Bank the amount of its Pro Rata Share of any
amounts so returned by the Agent or the Issuing Bank plus interest thereon from
the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such
Lender to the Agent or the Issuing Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.

     3.05 ROLE OF THE ISSUING BANK.

          (a) Each Lender and the Company agree that, in paying any drawing
under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to
obtain any document (other than any sight draft and certificates expressly
required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity
or accuracy of any such document which on its face appears valid or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.

          (b) No Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for:
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with
the approval of the Majority Lenders (or all of the Lenders, as applicable under
SECTION 11.01); (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness,
validity or enforceability of any L/C-Related Document.

          (c) The Company hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of
any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
PROVIDED, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not,
preclude the Company's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against
the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. No
Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or




                                       46
<PAGE>

assignees of the Issuing Bank, shall be liable or responsible for any of the
matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of SECTION 3.06; PROVIDED,
however, anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, that the
Company may have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank may be
liable to the Company, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Company which the
Company proves were caused by the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross
negligence or the Issuing Bank's willful failure to pay under any Letter of
Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) the Issuing
Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, unless it received a notice or
information to the contrary; and (ii) the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible
for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which appear to be in order
when presented.

     3.06 OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligations of the Company under this
Agreement and any L/C-Related Document to reimburse the Issuing Bank for a
drawing under a Letter of Credit, and to repay any L/C Borrowing and any drawing
under a Letter of Credit converted into Revolving Loans, shall be unconditional
and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and each such other L/C-Related Document under all circumstances,
including the following:

               (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
     any L/C-Related Document;

               (ii) any permitted change in the time, manner or place of payment
     of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of the Company
     in respect of any Letter of Credit or any other amendment or waiver of or
     any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C-Related Documents;

               (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
     that the Company may have at any time against any beneficiary or any
     transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such
     beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any
     other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
     contemplated hereby or by the L/C-Related Documents or any unrelated
     transaction;

               (iv) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented
     under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or
     otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any
     Letter of Credit;

               (v) any payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
     against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
     comply with the terms of any Letter of Credit; or any permitted payment
     made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit to any Person
     purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,


                                       47
<PAGE>

     assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
     representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of any
     Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any Insolvency
     Proceeding;

               (vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral,
     or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any
     other guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of the Company in
     respect of any Letter of Credit; or

               (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
     not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
     might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
     Company or a guarantor.

     3.07 CASH COLLATERAL PLEDGE. Upon (i) the request of the Agent or the
Majority Lenders, (A) if the Issuing Bank has honored any full or partial
drawing request on any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C
Borrowing hereunder, or (B) if, as of the Revolving Termination Date, any
Letters of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly
undrawn, or (ii) the occurrence of the circumstances described in SECTION
2.07(b) requiring the Company to Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit, then, the
Company shall immediately Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount
equal to such L/C Obligations.

     3.08 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

          (a) The Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of each of the
Lenders a letter of credit fee with respect to the Letters of Credit equal to
the Applicable Margin per annum of the average daily maximum amount available to
be drawn of the outstanding Letters of Credit, computed on a quarterly basis in
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December
based upon Letters of Credit outstanding for that quarter as calculated by the
Agent. Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears
on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter during which Letters of Credit
are outstanding, commencing on the first such quarterly date to occur after the
Closing Date, through the Revolving Termination Date (or such later date upon
which the outstanding Letters of Credit shall expire), with the final payment to
be made on the Revolving Termination Date (or such later expiration date).

          (b) The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank a letter of credit
fronting fee for each Letter of Credit Issued by the Issuing Bank equal to .125%
per annum of the face amount (or increased face amount, as the case may be) of
such Letter of Credit. Such Letter of Credit fronting fee shall be due and
payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
during which such Letter of Credit is outstanding, commencing on the first such
quarterly date to occur after such Letter of Credit is issued, through the
Revolving Termination Date (or such later date upon which such Letter of Credit
shall expire), with the final payment to be made on the Revolving Termination
Date (or such later expiration date).

          (c) The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank from time to time on
demand the normal issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees,
and other standard costs and charges, of the Issuing Bank relating to letters of
credit as from time to time in effect.


                                       48
<PAGE>

     3.09 UNIFORM CUSTOMS AND PRACTICE. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the
Issuing Bank and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any
such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the
"International Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of
International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in
effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit,
and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,
as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC")
at the time of issuance (including the ICC decision published by the Commission
on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single
currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

     3.10 OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIt. The Existing Letters of Credit set
forth on SCHEDULE 1.01 were issued prior to the Effective Date pursuant to the
Existing Credit Agreement and will remain outstanding as of the Closing Date.
The Company, the Issuing Bank and each of the Lenders hereby agree with respect
to the Existing Letters of Credit that each such Existing Letter of Credit, for
all purposes under this Agreement, shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit
governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Lender further
agrees to participate in each such Existing Letter of Credit in an amount equal
to its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of such Existing Letter of Credit.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

     4.01 TAXES.

          (a) Any and all payments by the Company to each Lender or the Agent
under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear
of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes. In addition, the
Company shall pay all Other Taxes.

          (b) If the Company shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any
Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, then:

               (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that,
          after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
          deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable
          under this Section), such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be,
          receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have received
          and retained had no such deductions or withholdings been made;

               (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and withholdings;

               (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
          to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with
          applicable law; and

               (iv) the Company shall also pay to each Lender or the Agent for
          the account of such Lender, at the time interest is paid, Further
          Taxes in the amount that the


                                       49
<PAGE>

          respective Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax
          yield the Lender would have received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or
          Further Taxes had not been imposed.

          (c) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender and
the Agent for the full amount of (i) Taxes, (ii) Other Taxes, and (iii) Further
Taxes in the amount that the respective Lender specifies as necessary to
preserve the after-tax yield the Lender would have received if such Taxes, Other
Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed, and any liability (including
penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made
within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Agent makes written demand
therefor.

          (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment pursuant to this
Section by the Company of Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, the Company shall
furnish to each Lender or the Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to
such Lender or the Agent.

          (e) If the Company is required to pay any amount to any Lender or the
Agent pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of this Section, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change
the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional
payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the sole
judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

     4.02 ILLEGALITY.

          (a) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Requirement
of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the interpretation or
administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it unlawful, or that any
central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans,
then, on notice thereof by the Lender to the Company through the Agent, any
obligation of that Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until
the Lender notifies the Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise
to such determination no longer exist.

          (b) If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Company shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact
and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay in full such
Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Lender then outstanding, together with interest
accrued thereon and amounts required under SECTION 4.04, either on the last day
of the Interest Period thereof, if the Lender may lawfully continue to maintain
such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Lender may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If the Company is
required to so prepay any Eurodollar Rate Loan, then concurrently with such
prepayment, the Company may borrow from the affected Lender, in the amount of
such repayment, a Base Rate Loan.

          (c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Loans has been so terminated or suspended, the Company may elect, by giving
notice to the Lender


                                       50
<PAGE>

          through the Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be made by the
          Lender as Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be instead Base Rate Loans.

          (d) Before giving any notice to the Agent under this Section, the
affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its
Eurodollar Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such
notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Lender, be
illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender.

     4.03 INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCTION OF RETURN.

          (a) If any Lender determines that, due to either (i) the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the
date of this Agreement or (ii) the compliance by that Lender with any guideline
or request after the date of this Agreement from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding
or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans (except for any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), or participating in
Letters of Credit, or, in the case of the Issuing Bank, any increase in the cost
to the Issuing Bank of agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any unpaid
drawing under any Letter of Credit, then the Company shall be liable for, and
shall from time to time, upon demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent to
the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts
as are sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs.

          (b) If any Lender shall have determined that (i) the introduction of
any Capital Adequacy Regulation after the date of this Agreement, (ii) any
change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation after the date of this Agreement,
(iii) any change after the date of this Agreement in the interpretation or
administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other
Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Lender (or its Lending Office) or any
corporation controlling the Lender with any Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects
or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
the Lender or any corporation controlling the Lender and (taking into
consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital) determines that
the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitment,
loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such
Lender to the Company through the Agent, the Company shall pay to the Lender,
from time to time as specified by the Lender, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate the Lender for such increase.

     4.04 FUNDING LOSSES. The Company shall reimburse each Lender and hold each
Lender harmless from any loss or expense which the Lender may sustain or incur
as a consequence of:

          (i) the failure of the Company to make on a timely basis any payment
of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan;


                                       51
<PAGE>

          (ii) the failure of the Company to borrow a Loan, continue a
Eurodollar Rate Loan or convert a Loan into a Eurodollar Rate Loan after the
Company has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice
of Conversion/ Continuation;

          (iii) the failure of the Company to make any prepayment in accordance
with any notice delivered under SECTION 2.06;

          (iv) the prepayment (including pursuant to SECTION 2.07) or other
payment (including after acceleration thereof) of an Eurodollar Rate Loan on a
day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or

          (v) the automatic conversion under SECTION 2.04 of any Eurodollar Rate
Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant
Interest Period; or

          (vi) any Buying Lender is deemed to have purchased a Eurodollar Rate
Loan bearing interest at a rate which is less than the prevailing rate of
interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans at the time of purchase in accordance with
SECTION 2.01(c); or

          (vii) any Selling Lender pursuant to SECTION 2.01(c) is deemed to have
sold a Eurodollar Rate Loan bearing interest at a rate which is higher than the
prevailing rate of interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans at the time of sale in
accordance with SECTION 2.01(c);

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. For
purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Lenders under this
Section and under SECTION 4.03(a), each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by a Lender
(and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be
conclusively deemed to have been funded at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in
determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan by a matching
deposit or other borrowing in the interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan is
in fact so funded.

     4.05 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Agent determines that for any
reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar
Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar
Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to SECTION 2.09(a)
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate
Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding
such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Agent revokes such notice in
writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the
Company does not revoke such Notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue
the Loans, as proposed by the Company, in the amount specified in the applicable
notice submitted by the Company, but such Loans shall be made, converted or
continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

     4.06 CERTIFICATES OF LENDERS. Any Lender claiming reimbursement or
compensation under this Article IV shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to
the Agent) a certificate setting


                                       52
<PAGE>

forth in reasonable detail the amount payable to the Lender hereunder and such
certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Company in the absence of
manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no amounts shall be payable by the Company pursuant to SECTIONS 4.03
or 4.04 with respect to any period commencing more than 180 days before the
delivery of the certificate contemplated by this SECTION 4.06 unless such
amounts are claimed as a result of the retroactive effect of any newly enacted
or adopted law, rule or regulation and such certificate is delivered within 180
days after such enactment or adoption.

     4.07 SURVIVAL. The agreements and obligations of the Company in this
Article IV shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

     4.08 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. Upon any Lender's making a claim for
compensation under SECTION 4.01 or 4.03, the Company may replace such Lender in
accordance with this Section. The Company may, upon notice to such Lender and
the Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its Revolving
Loan Commitment (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Company in such
instance) pursuant to SECTION 11.08(a) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible
Assignees procured by the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Company elects
to exercise such right with respect to any Lender, it shall be obligated to
replace all Lenders that have made similar requests for compensation pursuant to
SECTION 4.01 or 4.03. The Lender shall have received payment in full all
principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such Lender through the
date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant to SECTIONS 4.01,
4.03 and 4.04), and the Company shall release such Lender from its obligations
under the Loan Documents. Any Lender being replaced shall execute and deliver an
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such Lender's Revolving Loan
Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing
Line Loans.

                                   ARTICLE V

<PAGE>

Person is a party or any order, injunction, writ or decree of any Governmental

     6.07 ERISA COMPLIANCE.

          (a) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state law. Each

described therein; and the Collateral was delivered to the Collateral Agent or
its nominee in accordance with the terms thereof. The Lien of the Pledge and
Security Agreement constitutes a perfected, first priority security interest
other than Permitted Liens in all right, title and interest of the Company or

and Security Agreement), such pledge shall be limited to a pledge of 65% of the
issued and outstanding shares or other units of equity interests PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, if the pledge of more sixty-five percent (65%) of such Foreign
Subsidiary would not result in materially adverse tax consequences to the
pledgor under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if such materially
adverse tax consequences are no longer effective, then such pledged equity
interests shall constitute 100% or such other percentage of issued and
outstanding shares or other units of equity interests of such Foreign Subsidiary
and such Foreign Subsidiary shall execute and deliver the applicable Collateral
Documents. If any Excluded Subsidiary shall cease to be an Excluded Subsidiary
for any reason and to the extent any Excluded Subsidiary may do so without
violating federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to it, the
Company shall promptly notify the Agent thereof and such Subsidiary shall
promptly execute and deliver the Collateral Documents and all other instruments

Agreement, and when financing statements have been filed in the appropriate
offices in the jurisdictions of organization for the Company and the Guarantors
and when such other actions as are each described in each of the Collateral
Documents have been taken, each of the Collateral Documents shall constitute a
perfected security interest in all right, title and interest of such Person, as
the case may be, in the Collateral described therein, and except for Permitted
Liens existing on the Closing Date and those Liens whose priority cannot be
superseded by the provisions hereof or of any Collateral Document and filings
hereunder or thereunder, a perfected first lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of such Person, as the case may be, in the

equity interest shall constitute 100% or such other percentage of issued and
outstanding shares or other units of equity interests of such Foreign

and documents necessary in the opinion of the Agent to become a Guarantor and

     10.01 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION; "AGENT".

          (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to SECTION 10.09)
appoints, designates and authorizes the Agent (including, without limitation, in
its capacity as Collateral Agent) to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with
reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied
(or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended
to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

          (b) The Issuing Bank shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith
until such time and except for so long as the Agent may agree at the request of
the Majority Lenders to act for such Issuing Bank with respect thereto;
provided, however, that the Issuing Bank shall have all of the benefits and
immunities (i) provided to the Agent in this ARTICLE X with respect to any acts
taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of
Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the application and
agreements for letters of credit pertaining to the Letters of Credit as fully as
if the term "Agent", as used in this ARTICLE X, included the


                                       81
<PAGE>

Issuing Bank with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally
provided in this Agreement with respect to the Issuing Bank.

     10.02 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may execute any of its duties under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

     10.03 LIABILITY OF AGENT. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be
liable to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the Company or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, or any officer thereof, contained in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Company or any
other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Company or any
of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

     10.04 RELIANCE BY AGENT.

          (a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or
other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Majority Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority
Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

          (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in SECTION 5.01, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Lender for consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to
or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Lender.

     10.05 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect
to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid
to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Agent shall have
received written notice from a Lender or the Company referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". The Agent will notify the Lenders of its
receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Majority Lenders in
accordance with ARTICLE IX; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless and until the Agent
has received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest
of the Lenders.

     10.06 CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no
act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable lender regulatory laws relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to the Company and its Subsidiaries
hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession
of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

     10.07 INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the
Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the
Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), pro rata,
from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, HOWEVER, that no
Lender shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any
portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any
costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Company.


                                       83
<PAGE>

The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations
hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Agent.

     10.08 AGENT IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Bank of America and its Affiliates may
make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Agent or the
Issuing Lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The
Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its
Affiliates may receive information regarding the Company or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of the Company or such Subsidiary) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be
under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its
Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
the Agent.

     10.09 SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may, and at the request of the Majority
Lenders shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the Agent
resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Lenders shall appoint from among the
Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders which successor agent shall be
approved by the Company. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Lenders and the Company, a successor agent from among the
Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder,
such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this ARTICLE X and SECTIONS 11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Bank of America may not be
removed as the Agent at the request of the Majority Lenders unless Bank of
America shall also simultaneously be replaced as "Issuing Bank" hereunder
pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank
of America.

     10.10 WITHHOLDING TAX.

          (a) If any Lender is a "foreign corporation, partnership or trust"
within the meaning of the Code and such Lender claims exemption from, or a
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code, such
Lender agrees with and in favor of the Agent, to deliver to the Agent:

               (i) if such Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction of,
          withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, two properly
          completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN before the payment of
          any interest in the first calendar year


                                       84
<PAGE>

          and before the payment of any interest in each third succeeding
          calendar year during which interest may be paid under this Agreement;

               (ii) if such Lender claims that interest paid under this
          Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is
          effectively connected with a United States trade or business of such
          Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI
          before the payment of any interest is due in the first taxable year of
          such Lender and in each succeeding taxable year of such Lender during
          which interest may be paid under this Agreement; and

               (iii) such other form or forms as may be required under the Code
          or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from,
          or reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

          (b) If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form W-8BEN and such
Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or
part of the Obligations of the Company to such Lender, such Lender agrees to
notify the Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the
beneficial owner of Obligations of the Company to such Lender. To the extent of
such percentage amount, the Agent will treat such Lender's IRS Form W-8BEN as no
longer valid.

          (c) If any Lender claiming exemption from United States withholding
tax by filing IRS Form W-8ECI with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of the
Company to such Lender, such Lender agrees to undertake sole responsibility for
complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and
1442 of the Code.

          (d) If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account
such reduction. However, if the forms or other documentation required by clause
(a) of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold
from any interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by
Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction.

          (e) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered
the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any
other reason) such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties
and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Agent under this


                                       85
<PAGE>

Section, together with all costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs). The
obligation of the Lenders under this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Agent.

     10.11 COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS. The Lenders irrevocably authorize
the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion:

          (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the
Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Revolving
Loan Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent
indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of
Credit, (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any
sale permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (iii) subject to
SECTION 11.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Majority
Lenders;

          (b) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the
Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such
property that is permitted by SECTIONS 8.01(i), (j) or (m); and

          (c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty
if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted
hereunder.

Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Majority Lenders will
confirm in writing the Collateral Agent's authority to release or subordinate
its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this SECTION
10.11.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     11.01 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by
the Company or any other Guarantor therefrom, shall be effective unless in
writing signed by the Majority Lenders and the Company or the applicable
Guarantor, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Agent, and each such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amendment,
waiver or consent shall:

          (a) waive any condition set forth in SECTION 5.01 (except for 5.01(e))
without the written consent of each Lender;

          (b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any
Commitment terminated pursuant to SECTION 9.02) without the written consent of
such Lender;

          (c) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document for any payment (other than pursuant to SECTION 2.07) of principal,
interest, fees or other amounts


                                       86
<PAGE>

due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document
without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

          (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein
on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (v) of the second proviso
to this SECTION 11.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any
other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that only the consent of the Majority Lenders shall
be necessary (i) to amend the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any
obligation of the Company to pay interest at the Default Rate or (ii) to amend
any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the
effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or
L/C Borrowing or to reduce any fee payable hereunder; or

          (e) change SECTION 2.14 in a manner that would alter the pro rata
sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender;

          (f) change any provision of this Section or the definition of
"Majority Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender

          (g) release any Guarantor (other than pursuant to this Agreement or
the Collateral Documents) from the Guaranty without the written consent of each
Lender or release the Agent's Liens and security interests in all or
substantially all of the Collateral except as otherwise may be provided in this
Agreement or in the Collateral Documents or except where the consent of the
Majority Lenders only is provided for;

and, PROVIDED FURTHER, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Issuing Bank in addition to the Lenders required
above, affect the rights or duties of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement or
any Letter of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to
be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing
and signed by the Swing Line Bank in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Bank under this Agreement; (iii)

in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the
Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (iv) SECTION 11.08(g)
may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified without the consent of each
Granting Lender all or any part of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the
time of such amendment, waiver or other modification; and (v) the Fee Letter may
be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed
only by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not
be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.

     11.02 NOTICES.

liability to the Company or other Person on account of any action taken or not
taken by the Agent or the Lenders in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile

variance with the terms understood by the Agent and the Lenders to be contained
in the telephonic or facsimile notice.

     11.03 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise and no delay
in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

     11.04 COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Company shall:

"INDEMNIFIED PERSON") harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
charges, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following
repayment of the Loans, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the
termination, resignation or replacement of the Agent or replacement of any
Lender) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person in any
way relating to or arising out of the Company entering into this Agreement or
any document contemplated by or referred to herein, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or
in connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect to any
investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding or
appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of any act or failure to act of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the
Loans or Letters of Credit the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any
Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); PROVIDED, that the Company shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other
Obligations.

     11.06 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that the Company makes a payment to
the Agent or the Lenders, or the Agent or the Lenders exercise their right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then

intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b)
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand its pro rata share
of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Agent.

     11.07 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this Agreement shall be

successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Company may not assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or

<PAGE>

of SECTION 11.08, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions
of SECTION 11.08, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest
subject to the restrictions of SECTION 11.08, or (iv) to an SPC in accordance
with the provisions of SECTION 11.08 (and any other attempted assignment or
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in SECTION 11.08 and, to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

     11.08 ASSIGNMENTS, PARTICIPATIONS, ETC.

          (a) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for
purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing
Line Loans) at the time owing to it); PROVIDED that (i) except in the case of an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment
and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a
Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender,
the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the
date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Agent or, if the "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment
and Acceptance, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless
the Agent, and so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment
assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of
Swing Line Loans; (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank unless the Person that is the
proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would
otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance
and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to SECTION 11.08, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible
Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of SECTIONS 4.01,
4.03, 4.04, 11.04 and 11.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring
prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the Company (at
its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this


                                       90
<PAGE>

Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with SECTION 11.08(d).

          (b) From and after the date that the Agent notifies the assignor
Lender that it has received (and provided its consent with respect to) an
executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced
processing fee, (i) the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to
it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Lender
shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under the
Loan Documents.

          (c) Within five Business Days after its receipt of notice by the Agent
that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the
processing fee, (and provided that it consents to such assignment in accordance
with SECTION 11.08(a)), the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent, new
Notes (if requested by the Eligible Assignee) evidencing such Eligible
Assignee's assigned Loans and Commitment and, if the assignor Lender has
retained a portion of its Loans and its Commitment, replacement Notes in the
principal amount of the Loans retained by the assignor Lender (such Notes to be
in exchange for, but not in payment of, the Notes held by such Lender).
Immediately upon each Eligible Assignee's making its processing fee payment
under the Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be
amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition
of the Eligible Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising
therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Eligible Assignee shall reduce such
Commitments of the assigning Lender PRO TANTO.

          (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to,
the Company or the Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a
natural person or the Company or any of the Company's Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C
Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); PROVIDED that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Issuing Bank, the
Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
SECTION 11.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to SECTION
11.08(f), the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of SECTIONS 4.01, 4.03 and 4.04 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to SECTION 11.08(a),
PROVIDED that if because of circumstances in effect on the effective date of any
sale of a participating interest, the Company would, under SECTION 4.01, be
obligated to make any


                                       91
<PAGE>

payment to or for the account of the applicable Lender, the Company shall only
be obligated to make such payment to the extent that it would then have been
obligated to make such payment to such Lender if it had not sold such
participating interest. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also
shall be entitled to the benefits of SECTION 11.10 as though it were a Lender,
PROVIDED such Participant agrees to be subject to SECTION 2.14 as though it were
a Lender.

          (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender
may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of
its rights under and interest in this Agreement and the Note held by it in favor
of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S.
Treasury Regulation 31 CFR ss.203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce
such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.

          (f) No assignee, participant or other transferee of any Lender's
rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under ARTICLE IV than
such Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights
transferred or by reason of the provisions of ARTICLE IV requiring such Lender
to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances
or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not
exist.

          (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the
Agent and the Company (an "SPC") the option to provide all or any part of any
Revolving Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make
pursuant to this Agreement; PROVIDED that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a
commitment by any SPC to fund any Revolving Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not
to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such
Revolving Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Revolving
Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i)
neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall
increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations
of the Company under this Agreement (including its obligations under SECTIONS
4.01, 4.03 and 4.04), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and
(iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any
amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document,
remain the lender of record hereunder. The making of a Revolving Loan by an SPC
hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same
extent, and as if, such Revolving Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is
one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial
paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join
any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the
laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior
consent of the Company and the Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of
$3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect
to any Revolving Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential
basis any non-public information


                                       92
<PAGE>

relating to its funding of Revolving Loans to any rating agency, commercial
paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity
enhancement to such SPC.

          (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of
the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for
holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for
such obligations or securities, PROVIDED that unless and until such trustee
actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
SECTION 11.08, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of
its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even
though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the
pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

     11.09 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender agrees to take and to cause its
Affiliates to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to
maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" or
"secret" by the Company and provided to it or to which it otherwise is granted
access by the Company or any Subsidiary, or by the Agent on the Company's or
such Subsidiary's behalf, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and
neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such information other than
in connection with or in enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or in connection with other business now or hereafter existing or
contemplated with the Company or any Subsidiary or to disclose it to any third
person; except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Lender, or
(ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than the Company, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the Company known to the Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any
Lender may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any
requirement of any Governmental Authority to which the Lender is subject or in
connection with an examination of such Lender by any such authority; (B)
pursuant to subpoena or other court process; (C) when required to do so in
accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the
extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to
which the Agent, any Lender or their respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to
the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy
hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (F) to such Lender's independent
auditors and other professional advisors; (G) to any Participant or Eligible
Assignee, actual or potential, provided that such Person agrees in writing to
keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders
hereunder; (H) as to any Lender or its Affiliate, as expressly permitted under
the terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which
the Company or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed party with such Lender or
such Affiliate; and (I) to its Affiliates; PROVIDED that such Lender shall
provide notice to the Company of any requirement to disclose to a person who
does not have an obligation to such Lender (or pursuant to applicable law or
applicable court order) to keep such information confidential (it being
understood and agreed that the failure to provide such notice shall not
constitute a violation by such Lender of this SECTION 11.09).

     11.10 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Company, any such notice being waived


                                       93
<PAGE>

by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of the Company against any and all Obligations
owing to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not
the Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan
Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Agent after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

     11.11 NOTIFICATION OF ADDRESSES, LENDING OFFICES, ETC. Each Lender shall
notify the Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to
the Lender should be directed, of addresses of any Lending Office, of payment
instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and of such
other administrative information as the Agent shall reasonably request.

     11.12 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an
original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute but one and the same instrument.

     11.13 SEVERABILITY. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

     11.14 NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement is made and entered into
for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the Lenders, the Agent
and the Agent-Related Persons, and their permitted successors and assigns, and
no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any
direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents.

     11.15 GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.

          (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS; PROVIDED THAT THE PARTIES
SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

          (b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS OR
OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, AND BY EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS
CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF


                                       94
<PAGE>

FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. THE COMPANY, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS EACH WAIVE
PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE
BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY ILLINOIS LAW.

     11.16 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE LENDERS AND THE AGENT EACH
WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST
ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER
WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE COMPANY, THE
LENDERS AND THE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED
BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING
WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF.
THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     11.17 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Company,
the Lenders and the Agent, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.
