the USI Companies to establish, maintain or continue any of the group benefits plans already in
existence or hereafter adopted for the employees of the USI Companies, or restrict the right of the
USI Companies to amend, modify or terminate such group benefit plans in a manner which does not
discriminate against Executive as compared to other executive employees of USI Companies.

to Executive as &#147;Confidential Information&#148; having independent economic value; that such information
is not available from public sources; and that the USI Companies (including Company) have expended
considerable time and effort to develop, compile and protect such Confidential Information.
Executive therefore agrees that while Executive is providing services for the Company and at all
times thereafter, Executive shall not, without express prior written approval of the Company, use
any Confidential Information to directly or indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit business from
any client or Active Prospective Client of any USI Company (determined as of the earlier of the

Executive will refrain from carrying on any business, directly or indirectly, which provides any
USI Business, except (a)&nbsp;in the normal course of business on behalf of any USI Company during the
term of Executive&#146;s employment under this Agreement; or (b)&nbsp;with the Company&#146;s prior written
consent. The term &#147;carrying on any business&#148; shall mean to act as a sole proprietor, partner,
member of a limited liability company, stockholder, officer, director, employee, manager, trustee,
agent, advisor, joint venturer, or consultant of, with or to, any business, or otherwise to own,
manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or
engage in, any business. It is expressly agreed that this Section&nbsp;7.2 is not intended to restrict
or prohibit the ownership by Executive of stock or other securities of a publicly-held corporation
in which Executive (i)&nbsp;does not possess beneficial ownership of more than 5% of the voting capital
stock of such corporation and/or (ii)&nbsp;does not participate in any management or advisory capacity.
In addition, it is also agreed that this Section&nbsp;7.2 shall not prohibit Executive from serving as a
director pursuant to the terms of Section&nbsp;2.3 during the term of his employment under this
Agreement. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.2 shall
be enforced under the laws and public polices applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Section&nbsp;7.2 is adjudicated to be invalid
or unenforceable or shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographic
scope, activity or subject, it shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be
enforceable to the extent compatible with applicable laws and such provision shall be deemed
modified and amended to the extent necessary to render such provision enforceable in such
jurisdiction. If Executive challenges the enforceability of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.2 in
whole or in part, then, without limiting any remedy available to the Company (including specific
performance of the covenants contained in Sections&nbsp;6 and 7 hereof) Executive shall have forfeited
any right to any payments and benefits under this Agreement that he has not already received,

is employed or engaged by the Company or by any USI Company; (e)&nbsp;soliciting, causing to be

crucial importance to the Company and that any damage caused by the breach of Sections&nbsp;6 or 7 of
