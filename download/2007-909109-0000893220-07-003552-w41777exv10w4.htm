This Article is intended as an aid to compelling arbitration or enforcing such arbitration or

disputes arising from this Contract or the Reinsurer&#146;s rights to commence an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;In the event of insolvency and the appointment of a conservator, liquidator, or statutory
successor of the Reinsured, the portion of any risk or obligation assumed by the Reinsurer shall be
payable to the conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor on the basis of claims allowed
against the insolvent Reinsured by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any conservator,
liquidator, or statutory successor of the Reinsured having authority to allow such claims, without
diminution because of that insolvency, or because the conservator, liquidator, or statutory
successor has failed to pay all or a portion of any claims.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Payments by the Reinsurer as above set forth shall be made directly to the Reinsured or to
its conservator, liquidator, or statutory successor, except where this contract of reinsurance
specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance or except as provided by applicable law and
regulation (such as subsection (a)&nbsp;of section 4118 of the New York Insurance laws) in the event of
the insolvency of the Reinsured.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;In the event of the insolvency of the Reinsured, the liquidator, receiver, conservator or
statutory successor of the Reinsured shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of
a claim against the insolvent Reinsured on the Policy or Policies reinsured within a reasonable
time after such claim is filed in the insolvency proceeding and during the pendency of such claim
any Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where
such claim is to be adjudicated any defense or defenses which it may deem available to the
Reinsured or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus
incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable subject to court approval against the insolvent
Reinsured as part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the
benefit which may accrue to the Reinsured solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the
Reinsurer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Where two (2)&nbsp;or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest
elects to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the
terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Reinsured.

an opportunity to be associated with the Reinsured, at the expense of the Reinsurer, in the defense
of any claim, suit or proceeding involving this Contract, and the Reinsured and the Reinsurer shall
cooperate in every respect in the defense of such claim, suit or proceeding, provided the Reinsured
shall have the right to make any decision in the event of disagreement over any matter of defense
or settlement subject always to the conditions of the Article entitled &#147;Original Conditions&#148;.

that there is an adequate balance in place, and further provided that such advice to draw is

information contained therein is unreasonably insufficient or not in substantial accordance with

If the sum of the compensating additional amount computed in respect of any overdue payment is less
than 0.25% of the amount overdue, or $1,000, whichever is greater, and/or the overdue period is one
week or less, then the interest amount shall be waived. The basis point standards referred to above
shall be doubled if the late payment is due from a Reinsurer who is no longer an active reinsurance
market.

and their respective successors and assigns provided, however, that this Contract may not be
assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other which consent may be

collection.
