executive officer, and key employee of Arrowhead General Insurance Company, Inc. and/or one or more of the Company&#146;s directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries (collectively, &#147;<U>Arrowhead</U>&#148;). Arrowhead General Insurance Agency

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">B. In connection with and conditioned upon the completion of the Merger, the Company has made an offer of employment to Executive and Executive is willing to accept such offer on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement. Executive&#146;s entry into this Agreement with the Company is a condition to Executive&#146;s employment with the Company, and the rights and obligations that comprise this Agreement equally extend to the Company&#146;s
Affiliates. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">C. Executive shall serve an executive officer of the Company, and may from time to time serve as a director,
manager, and/or executive officer of Arrowhead and/or one or more of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries or affiliated entities (&#147;<U>Affiliates</U>&#148;) and, by virtue of title and position, shall occupy a position of trust and shall be

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">D. The Company and its Affiliates comprise one of the largest insurance intermediary organizations in the United States of America and in the world. The Company, through its Affiliates, is in the business
of selling and servicing insurance, risk transfer alternatives, and related services including, but not limited to, the business of quoting, proposing, soliciting, selling, placing, providing, servicing and/or renewing insurance, reinsurance, and
surety products, as well as loss control, claims administration, risk management, program administration, Medicare secondary payer statute compliance, Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and other services (as such
products and services may be developed, added by acquisition or modified from time to time, the &#147;<U>Insurance Business&#148;</U>). The Company has a compelling interest in maintaining the confidentiality of Confidential Information and/or Trade
Secrets (as such terms are defined in Section Error! Reference source not found. of this Agreement), retaining its employees, and maintaining the customer relationships and business goodwill the Company acquires. Executive will have extensive and
intimate knowledge of the Company&#146;s strategic goals, including particularized plans and processes developed by the Company, either through the Executive&#146;s efforts or other Senior Leadership while employed by the Company, which are unknown
to others in the industry and which give the Company a competitive advantage. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">D. Executive shall also have responsibility for
the performance and results of various business units, divisions, profit centers and Affiliates of the Company and for developing and/or executing strategic plans for the Company and/or its Affiliates. Executive&#146;s role in the Senior Leadership
will be such that the Company&#146;s Confidential Information and Trade Secrets will necessarily become so entwined with Executive&#146;s own base knowledge and experience that it will become inextricable and would, in a subsequent competitive
venture, result in the inevitable disclosure and compromise of the Company&#146;s Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, whether such reliance or disclosure would be done consciously or unconsciously by Executive. </FONT></P>
