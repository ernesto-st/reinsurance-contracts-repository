        such L/C Credit Extension, (w) the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan

        undrawn amount of all outstanding Foreign Letters of Credit issued by
        such L/C Issuer and Affiliates of such L/C Issuer would exceed the L/C
        Issuer Foreign Letter of Credit Sublimit for such L/C Issuer; provided
                                                                      --------
        further that solely for purposes of determining the Outstanding Amount
        -------
        of such L/C Obligations under clauses (x) and (y) this Section

        2.03(a)(i) the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Foreign
        ----------
        Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the Foreign
        Letter of Credit Sublimit. The Borrower shall have the right to change
        the Foreign Letter of Credit Sublimit and the L/C Issuer Foreign Letter
        of Credit Sublimits by delivering to the Administrative Agent a notice
        to such effect (the "Foreign Letter of Credit Sublimit Notice") on the
                             ----------------------------------------
        first Business Day of any calendar month; provided, however, that no
                                                  --------  -------
        more than eight such notices shall be delivered by the Borrower in any
        single Fiscal Year. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the
        terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of
        Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may,
        during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters
        of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.
        All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued
        pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to
        and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

                (ii)    An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any
        Letter of Credit if:

                        (A)     any order, judgment or decree of any
                Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport
                to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of
                Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request
                or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
                Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer
                shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the
                issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit
                in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect
                to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
                requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise
                compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or
                shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or
                expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which
                the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;

                        (B)     subject to Section 2.03(b)(v), (x) in the case
                                           ------------------
                of a Standby Letter of Credit, the expiry date of such requested
                Standby Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months
                after the date of issuance or last renewal, or (y) in the case
                of Trade Letter of Credit, the expiry date of such requested
                Trade Letter of Credit would occur more than six months after
                the date of issuance or last

                renewal, in each case unless the Required Lenders have approved
                such expiry date;

                        (C)     in the judgment of the L/C Issuer, the foreign
                currency in which such Letter of Credit is requested to be
                denominated is not readily free and available;

                        (D)     the issuance of such Letter of Credit would
                violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer; or

                        (E)     after giving effect to the issuance of such
                Letter of Credit, the aggregate face amount of all then
                outstanding Letters of Credit denominated in a currency other
                than Dollars would exceed $25,000,000.

                (iii)   The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any
        Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such
        time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms
        hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept
        the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

        (b)     Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;
                -----------------------------------------------------------
Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.
------------------------------

                (i)     Each Domestic Letter of Credit shall be issued or
        amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered
        to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form
        of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by
        a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application
        must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not
        later than 1:00 p.m. at least one Business Day (or such later date and
        time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole
        discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as
        the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a
        Domestic Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
        specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the
        proposed issuance date of the requested Domestic Letter of Credit (which
        shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date
        thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the
        documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
        thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such
        beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other
        matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an
        amendment of any outstanding Domestic Letter of Credit, such Letter of
        Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the
        L/C Issuer (A) the Domestic Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the
        proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C)
        the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the
        L/C Issuer may require.

                (ii)    Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
        Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent
        (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received
        a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if
        not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy

                                       39

<PAGE>

        thereof. Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the
        Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is
        permitted in accordance with the terms hereof and if the requested form
        of Domestic Letter of Credit is acceptable to such L/C Issuer in its
        sole discretion, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
        L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Domestic Letter of
        Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable
        amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C
        Issuer's usual and customary business practices.

                (iii)   Each Foreign Letter of Credit shall be issued or
        amended, as the case may be, in accordance with the usual and customary
        business practices of the Foreign Affiliate L/C Issuer issuing such
        Foreign Letter of Credit.

                (iv)    Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit,
        each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
        unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk
        participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product
        of such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such
        Letter of Credit.

                (v)     If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of
        Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute
        discretion, agree to issue a Domestic Letter of Credit that has
        automatic renewal provisions (each, an "Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit");
                                                -----------------------------
        provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the L/C
        -------- ----
        Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month
        period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Domestic Letter of
        Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than
        a day (the "Non-Renewal Notice Date") in each such twelve-month period
                    -----------------------
        to be agreed upon at the time such Domestic Letter of Credit is issued.
        Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be
        required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such
        renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the
        Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not
        require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Domestic Letter of
        Credit at any time; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not
                            --------  -------
        permit any such renewal if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it
        would have no obligation at such time to issue such Domestic Letter of
        Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the
        provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received
                      -------------------
        notice (which may be by telephone confirmed in writing) on or before the
        day that is five Business Days before the Non-Renewal Notice Date (1)
        from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not
        to permit such renewal or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any
        Revolving Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable
        conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied.
                                ------------
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the L/C
        Issuer shall have no obligation to permit the renewal of any
        Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit at any time.

                (vi)    Promptly after its delivery of any Domestic Letter of
        Credit or any amendment to a Domestic Letter of Credit to an advising
        bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer
        will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true
        and complete copy of such Domestic Letter of Credit or amendment.

                                       40

                (vii)   With respect to any Letter of Credit denominated in a
        currency other than Dollars, on each Calculation Date, the L/C Issuer
        will (A) determine the relevant Exchange Rate as of such Calculation
        Date and (B) give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the
        Borrower. The Exchange Rate so determined shall become effective on the
        first Business Day immediately following the relevant Calculation Date
        (a "Reset Date"), shall remain effective until the next succeeding Reset
            ----------
        Date, and shall for all purposes be the Exchange Rate employed in
        converting any amounts between Dollars and the applicable foreign
        currency with respect to such Letter of Credit; provided that in the
        case of any payment by the L/C Issuer under any such Letter of Credit
        the relevant Exchange Rate so determined shall become effective on such
        date of payment.

        (c)     Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.
                ------------------------------------------------------

                (i)     Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of
        Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C
        Issuer shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
        thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the later of (A) the date of any
        payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit and (B) the Business
        Day on which notice of such drawing has been delivered to the Borrower
        prior to 11:00 a.m. (or, if such delivery occurs after 11:00 a.m., the
        Business Day immediately following such delivery) (each such date, an
        "Honor Date"), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the
         ----------
        Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing,
        together with interest from the date of payment by the L/C Issuer at the
        sum of the Base Rate plus the corresponding Applicable Rate (which
                             ----
        amount, in the case of a payment under a Letter of Credit which is
        denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated in
        Dollars by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate). If the Borrower
        for any reason does not reimburse the L/C Issuer as provided in the
        preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
        Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed
        drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such Revolving
                      -------------------
        Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be
        deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed
        on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount (which
        amount, in the case of a payment under a Letter of Credit which is
        denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated in
        Dollars by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate), without regard to
        the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal
                                               ------------
        amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized
        portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments and the conditions set forth
        in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice). Any notice
           ------------
        given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
        Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in
        ------------------
        writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall
        not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

                (ii)    Each Revolving Lender (including the Revolving Lender
        acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section
                                                                -------
        2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the
        ----------
        account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an
        amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later
        than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
        Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section
                                                                      -------
        2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving

                                       41

<PAGE>

        Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base
        Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall
        remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.

                (iii)   With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not
        fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the
        conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any
                                ------------
        other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C
        Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is
        not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on
        demand and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each
        Revolving Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account
        of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed
                                      -------------------
        payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
        constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction of
        its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.
                                                ------------

                (iv)    Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or
        L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer
                                     ---------------
        for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of
        such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely
        for the account of the L/C Issuer.

                (v)     Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving
        Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn
        under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall
                                                         ---------------
        be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
        circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
        defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against the
        L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever;
        (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other
        occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the
        foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lender's obligation to
        make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the
                                              ---------------
        conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the
                                ------------
        Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall
        relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
        the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer
        under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

                (vi)    If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the
        Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount
        required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing
        provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section
                           ---------------                          -------
        2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such
        -----------
        Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand,
        such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such
        payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately
        available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
        Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer
        submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent)
        with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be
        conclusive absent manifest error.

        (d)     Repayment of Participations.

<PAGE>

                (i)     At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment
        under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender
        such Revolving Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in
        accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives
                        ---------------
        for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related
        Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the
        Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied
        thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will
        distribute to such Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof
        (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect
        the period of time during which such Revolving Lender's L/C Advance was
        outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative
        Agent.

                (ii)    If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for
        the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required
                                                  ------------------
        to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06
                                                                   -------------
        (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in
        its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative
        Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on
        demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date
        of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving
        Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
        time in effect.

        (e)     Obligations Absolute. The Obligation of the Borrower to
                --------------------
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to
repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

                (i)     any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of
        Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating
        thereto;

                (ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off,
        defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against
        any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any
        Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
        acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with
        this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter
        of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any
        unrelated transaction;

                (iii)   any draft, demand, certificate or other document
        presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
        invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
        untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
        transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
        drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                (iv)    any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of
        Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
        strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment
        made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person
        purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
        assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
        representative of or successor to any

                                       43

<PAGE>

        beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any
        arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;
        or

                (v)     any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
        or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance
        that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
        of, the Borrower.

        The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the
Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

        (f)     Role of L/C Issuer. Each Revolving Lender and the Borrower agree
                ------------------
that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not
have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft,
certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the
L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Revolving
Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request
or with the approval of the Revolving Lenders or the Required Lenders, as
applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence
or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or
Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to,
                  --------  -------
and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it
may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the
respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be
liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(v) of Section 2.03(e) or in the last sentence of this Section 2.03(f);
       ---------------                                 ---------------
provided, however, that anything in such clauses or in the last sentence of this
--------  -------
Section 2.03(f) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim
---------------
against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the
extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or
exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were
caused by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C
Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the
presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s)
strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept
documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of
any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

        (g)     Cash Collateral. (i) Upon the request of the Administrative
                ---------------
Agent, if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under
any Letter of Credit and such

                                       44

<PAGE>

drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) upon the request of either the
Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, if, as of the Letter of Credit Cash
Collateralization Date, any Letter of Credit (including any Auto-Renewal Letter
of Credit) may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly
undrawn, the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding
Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount
determined as of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit Cash
Collateralization Date, as the case may be). For purposes hereof, "Cash
                                                                   ----
Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative
-------------
Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Revolving Lenders, as
collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to
documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and
the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Revolving
Lenders). The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Revolving Lenders, a security interest in all
such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the
foregoing. Cash collateral shall be maintained in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account in accordance with the terms of the Pledge and Security Agreement.

        (h)     Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly
                ------------------------------
agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued
(including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i)
the rules of the "International Standby Practices (ISP98)" published by the
Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof
as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each Standby Letter
of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of
Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance (including the ICC decision
               ---
published by the Commission on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998
regarding the European single currency (euro)) shall apply to each Trade Letter
of Credit.

        (i)     Letter of Credit Fees.
                ---------------------

                (i)     The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
        the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata
        Share a Letter of Credit fee for each Domestic Letter of Credit equal to
        the corresponding Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount
        available to be drawn under such Domestic Letter of Credit (whether or
        not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Domestic Letter of
        Credit). Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly
        basis in arrears. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable on
        the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December,
        commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such
        Letter of Credit, on the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, on
        the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and thereafter on demand. If there is
        any change in the corresponding Applicable Rate during any quarter, the
        daily maximum amount of each Domestic Letter of Credit shall be computed
        and multiplied by the corresponding Applicable Rate separately for each
        period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

                (ii)    The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
        the account of each Revolving Lender a fee, payable quarterly in arrears
        on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December,
        equal to the actual Foreign Letter of Credit

                                       45

<PAGE>

        Sublimit applicable during each month of such quarter multiplied by 50%
                                                              ----------
        of the corresponding Applicable Rate. In addition, the Borrower shall
        pay such fees in connection with each Foreign Letter of Credit as shall
        be required in accordance with the usual and customary business
        practices of the Foreign Affiliate L/C Issuer issuing such Foreign
        Letter of Credit

                (iii)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
        Event of Default, the amount of any fee payable by the Borrower under
        this Section 2.03(i) shall be increased by 2% per annum.
             ---------------

                (iv)    For purposes of calculating any fees payable under this
        Section 2.03, any amount described in this Section 2.03 which is
        ------------                               ------------
        denominated in a currency other than Dollars shall be valued based on
        the applicable Exchange Rate for such currency as of the applicable date
        of determination.

        (j)     Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to
                --------------------------------------------------------------
L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own
----------
account a fronting fee with respect to each Domestic Letter of Credit of 0.125%
per annum. Such fronting fee shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears
and payable on the dates set forth in Section 2.03(i)(ii). In addition, the
                                      -------------------
Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary
issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard
costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time
to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due
and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

        (k)     Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any
                ------------------------------------------
conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

        2.04    SWING LINE LOANS.

        (a)     The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
                --------------
herein, each Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Swing
                                                                        -----
Line Loan") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
---------
Availability Period in an aggregate amount for all Swing Line Lenders taken
together not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line
Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated
with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of Loans and L/C Obligations
of the Revolving Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of
such Revolving Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment; provided, however, that after
                                                   --------  -------
giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Utilization of Revolving
Loan Commitments shall not exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments, and (ii) the
aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender,
plus such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C

Amount of such L/C Obligations under this Section 2.04(a)(ii) the aggregate
                                          -------------------
undrawn amount of all outstanding Foreign Letters of Credit shall be deemed to
be an amount equal to the Foreign Letter of Credit Sublimit), plus such

Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line
Loans shall not exceed such Revolving Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, and
provided, further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing

Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the

                                       46

<PAGE>

foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and
                               ------------               ------------
reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate
                    ------------
Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Lender
shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan
in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Revolving Loan Commitments times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.
                               -----

        (b)     Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made
                --------------------
upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than
11:00 a.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to
be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $1,000,000, or an integral multiple of
$500,000 in excess thereof and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be
a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written
Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower (or any individual designated by such Responsible
Officer in writing to the Administrative Agent). Promptly after receipt by the
Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line
Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)
that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and,
if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone
or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has
received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent
(including at the request of any Revolving Lender) prior to 12:00 noon on the
date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender
not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the
proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the
                                 ---------------
applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then,

        (c)     Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.
                -------------------------------

                (i)     The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and
        absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
        irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its
        behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount
        equal to such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing
        Line Loans then outstanding and shall, no later than 14 days after the
        making of any Swing Line Loan then still outstanding, request, on behalf
        of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line
        Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a
        Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata
        Share of the amount of such Swing Line Loan. Any such request shall be
        made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan
        Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of
        Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified
        ------------
        therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the
        unutilized portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments and the

                                       47

<PAGE>

        conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall
                                ------------
        furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly
        after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving
        Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount
        specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in
        immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at
        the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 9:00 a.m. on the day
        specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section
                                                             -------
        2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall
        -----------
        be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount.
        The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing
        Line Lender.

                (ii)    If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be
        refinanced by such a Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i),
                                                          ------------------
        the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as
        set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line
        Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the
        relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Lender's payment to the
        Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant
        to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such
           ------------------
        participation.

                (iii)   If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the
        Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount
        required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing
        provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section
                           ---------------                          -------

        maturity as follows:

                        (A)     if a Base Rate Loan, then the sum of the Base

                        (A)     each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on

                Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such

                                ----

                        (B)     each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
                outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
                borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus
                                                                          ----
                the corresponding Applicable Rate; and

                (iii)   each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
        outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date
        at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the corresponding
                                                   ----
        Applicable Rate.

        (b)     If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is
not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore,

        2.10    FEES. In addition to certain fees described in Section 2.03(i)
                                                               ---------------
and (j):
    ---

        (a)     Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
                --------------
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a
commitment fee equal to the corresponding Applicable Rate times the actual daily
                                                          -----
amount by which the Revolving Loan Commitments exceed the Total Utilization of
Revolving Loan Commitments. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during
the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
              ----------
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly
in arrears, and if there is any change in the corresponding Applicable Rate
during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by
the corresponding Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter
that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

        (b)     Other Fees.
                ----------

                                       55

<PAGE>

                (i)     The Borrower shall pay to the Joint Lead Arrangers and
        the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the
        amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be
        fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason
        whatsoever.

                (ii)    The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall
        have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the
        times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall
        not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

        2.11    COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest
for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by CNA's "prime rate" shall
be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made
on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more
fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a
365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan
is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on
which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on
                                        --------
the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.13(a), bear
                                                   ---------------
interest for one day.

        2.12    EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

        (a)     The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by
one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Tranche B Term Note
and/or a Revolving Loan Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in
addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its
Notes and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of
its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

        (b)     In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section
                                                                       -------
2.12(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance
-------
with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales
by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In
the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control
in the absence of manifest error.

        2.13    PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

                                       56

<PAGE>

        (a)     All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon
on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute
to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein)
of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's
Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00
noon shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any
applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, payments of amounts deposited in the Cash Collateral Account pursuant
to the proviso in Section 2.05(c)(iii) shall be deemed to have been paid by the
                  --------------------
Borrower on the applicable date or dates such amounts are applied to prepay
Eurodollar Rate Loans.

        (b)     If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a
day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following
Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing
interest or fees, as the case may be.

        (c)     Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it
to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such
payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make
available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds, then:

                (i)     if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender
        shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion
        of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in
        immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect
        of each day from and including the date such amount was made available
        by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is
        repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the
        Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                (ii)    if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender
        shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount
        thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon
        for the period from the date such amount was made available by the
        Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
        recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
                                                    -------------------
        rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
        effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
        then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the
        applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
        upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
        Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower
        shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with
        interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
        to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing
        herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to

                                       57

<PAGE>

        fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
        Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
        result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

        A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.13(c) shall be conclusive,
                                       ---------------
absent manifest error.

        (d)     If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds
for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions
of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
        ----------
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension
set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
             ----------
hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as
received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

        (e)     The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to
fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and
not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such
participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender
of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase
its participation.

        (f)     Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

        2.14    SHARING OF PAYMENTS. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or
the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it, any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the
participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case
may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the
excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may
be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of
                                --------  -------
such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any
of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any
                                  -------------
settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such
purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount
equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)
the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount
so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered,
without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as
                        -------------
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation. The Administrative Agent will

                                       58

<PAGE>

keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest
error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case
notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that
purchases a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such
purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and
other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the
Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were
the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

        2.15    INCREASE IN COMMITMENTS.

        (a)     Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Revolving Lenders), the
Borrower may on a one-time basis, request an increase in the Revolving Loan
Commitments by an amount not exceeding $25,000,000. At the time of sending such
notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall
specify the time period within which each Revolving Lender is requested to
respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of
delivery of such notice to the Revolving Lenders). Each Revolving Lender shall
notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees
to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal
to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase.
Any Revolving Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to
have declined to increase its Revolving Loan Commitment. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Revolving Lender of the Revolving
Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of
a requested increase, the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees
to become Revolving Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.

        (b)     If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with
this Section 2.15, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the
     ------------
effective date (the "Revolving Loan Commitment Increase Effective Date") and the
                     -------------------------------------------------
final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders of the final allocation of such
increase and the Revolving Loan Commitment Increase Effective Date. As a
condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Revolving
Loan Commitment Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Revolving
Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and
attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to
such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and
after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties
contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and
             ---------
as of the Revolving Loan Commitment Increase Effective Date, except to the
extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier
date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and
except that for purposes of this Section 2.15, the representations and
                                 ------------
warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

        3.01    TAXES.

        (a)     Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the
                                                   ---------
Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the
Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is
organized or maintains a lending office and, if the forms provided by a Foreign
Lender pursuant to Section 10.15(a) at the time such Foreign Lender first
                   ----------------
becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United States interest withholding
tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered
excluded from Taxes unless and until such Foreign Lender provides new forms
certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser
rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such
forms (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions,
assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by any
                            -----
Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan
Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01), each
                                                            ------------
of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum
it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such
Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof.

        (b)     In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").
                -----------

        (c)     If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or
Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such

                                       60

<PAGE>

Lender specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring
in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

        (d)     The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
under this Section 3.01) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii)
           ------------
amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including
                      ---------------
additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
Payment under this Section 3.01(d) shall be made within 30 days after the date
                   ---------------
the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

        3.02    ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable,
convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if
such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate
a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such
notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be
materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

        3.03    INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders determine
that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest
Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative
Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the
obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required
Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may
revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such
request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount
specified therein.

        3.04    INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

                                       61

<PAGE>

        (a)     If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of
or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law (which term for purposes of
this Section 3.04 shall include without limitation all applicable administrative
     ------------
orders, directed duties, requests, licenses, guidelines, authorizations and
permits of, and agreements with, any Governmental Authority, in each case
whether or not having the force of law), or such Lender's compliance therewith,
there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or
making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as the case may be)
issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount
received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing
(excluding for purposes of this Section 3.04(a) any such increased costs or
                                ---------------
reduction in amount resulting from (i) taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall
                                                          ------------
govern), (ii) changes in the basis or rate of taxation of overall net income or
overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any
political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is
organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve requirements contemplated
by Section 3.04(c)), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a
   ---------------
copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
                   --------
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 3.04(a) for any increased cost or
                                     ---------------
reduction in respect of a period occurring more than 180 days prior to the date
that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim
compensation therefor unless the circumstances giving rise to such increased
cost or reduction became applicable retroactively, in which case no such time
limitation shall apply so long as such Lender requests compensation within 180
days from the date such circumstances become applicable.

        (b)     If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's
obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to
time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction; provided that the
                                                           --------
Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section
                                                                       -------
3.04(b) for any reduction in respect of a period occurring more than 180 days
-------
prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's
intention to claim compensation therefor unless the circumstances giving rise to
such reduction became applicable retroactively, in which case no such time
limitation shall apply so long as such Lender requests compensation within 180
days from the date such circumstances become applicable.

        (c)     The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender
shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
"Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves
allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good
faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable
on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower
                                                        --------
shall have received at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such

                                       62

<PAGE>

Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest
Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 15 days from
receipt of such notice.

        3.05    FUNDING LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
incurred by it as a result of:

        (a)     any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of
acceleration, or otherwise); or

        (b)     any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure
of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the
Borrower;

including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of
funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the
deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any
customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the
foregoing.

        For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the
Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each
                   ------------
Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a
matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market
for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

        3.06    MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION. A
certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation
under this Article III and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be
           -----------
paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In
determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

        3.07    SURVIVAL. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article
                                                                       -------
III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all
---
other Obligations hereunder.

        5.02    AUTHORIZATION; NO CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Loan Party of each Loan Document to which such Person is
party, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other

        5.04    BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement has been, and each other Loan

is party thereto in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles.

        5.05    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.

        (a)     The Audited Financial Statements and the consolidating balance

throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted

investigation, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligation under any Guarantee, contingent liability or liability for taxes,
long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that, as of the
Closing Date, is not reflected in the Audited Financial Statements and, as of

            ------------
have a Material Adverse Effect.

        (b)     The unaudited consolidated and consolidating balance sheets of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries dated August 25, 2002, and the related
consolidated and consolidating statements of income and consolidated statements
of shareholders' equity and cash flows for the Fiscal Quarter ended on that date
(i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied in all material
respects throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly
noted therein, and (ii) fairly present the financial condition of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and their results of operations for
the period covered thereby, subject, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to the
absence of footnotes and to normal year-end audit adjustments.

        (c)     The forecasted balance sheets and statements of income of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section
                                                                   -------

Memorandum were prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions stated
therein, which assumptions were fair in light of the conditions existing at the
time of delivery of such forecasts, and represented, at the time of delivery,
the Borrower's best estimate of its future financial performance.

        (d)     Since the date of the Audited Financial Statements, there has
been no event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has

disputes pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened or

of their properties or revenues that (a) purport to affect or pertain to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (b) either individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        5.07    NO DEFAULT. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in
default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation that could, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Loan Document.

        5.08    OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS; REAL PROPERTY.

        (a)     Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary has good record and
marketable title in fee simple to, or valid leasehold interests in, all real
property necessary or used in the ordinary conduct of its business, except for
such defects in title as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The property of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries is subject to no Liens, other than Liens permitted by Section
                                                                       -------
7.01.
----

        (b)     As of the Closing Date, Schedule 5.08 annexed hereto contains a
                                        -------------
true, accurate and complete list of (i) all fee interests in any Real Property
Assets and (ii) all leases, subleases or assignments of leases (together with
all amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals or extensions of any
thereof) affecting each Real Property Asset of any Loan Party, regardless of
whether such Loan Party is the landlord or tenant (whether directly or as an
assignee or successor in interest) under such lease, sublease or assignment.
Except as specified in Schedule 5.08 annexed hereto, each agreement listed in
                       -------------
clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is in full force and effect
and the Borrower does not have knowledge of any material default that has
occurred and is continuing thereunder, and each such agreement constitutes the
legally valid and binding obligation of each applicable Loan Party, enforceable
against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles.

        5.09    ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. The operations and properties of each
Loan Party and each of its Subsidiaries comply in all respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws and

                                       70

<PAGE>

Environmental Permits except where such noncompliance could not have a Material
Adverse Effect, and no circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely to
(a) form the basis of an Environmental Claim against any Loan Party or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their properties that could have a Material Adverse
Effect or (b) cause any such property to be subject to any restrictions on
ownership, occupancy, use or transferability under any Environmental Law that
could have a Material Adverse Effect.

        5.10    INSURANCE. The properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies not
Affiliates of the Borrower, or with Majestic Insurance International Ltd., a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Borrower, in such amounts, with such deductibles
and covering such risks as are customarily carried by companies of similar size
engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where
the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary operates. Property insurance insuring
real and personal property on a replacement cost basis unless otherwise noted in
Section 6.07(a) and business interruption coverage policies contain a loss
---------------
payable subsection or endorsement, satisfactory in form and substance to the
Administrative Agent, that names the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties as the loss payee thereunder for any covered loss with respect
to the Collateral, as its interests may appear. General and automobile liability
insurance policies name the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties as an additional insured thereunder, as its interests may appear. All
insurance policies provide for at least 30 days prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent of any material modification or cancellation of such
policy.

        5.11    TAXES.

        (a)     The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all federal, state
and other material tax returns and reports required to be filed, and have paid
all federal, state and other material taxes, assessments, fees and other
governmental charges levied or imposed upon them or their properties, income or
assets otherwise due and payable, except those which are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and for which adequate
reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP. There is no proposed tax
assessment against the Borrower or any Subsidiary that would, if made, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

        (b)     Neither any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to
any tax sharing agreement.

        (c)     No issues have been raised by taxing authorities that, in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        5.12    ERISA COMPLIANCE; FOREIGN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

        (a)     Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state Laws. Each
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter
is currently being processed by the IRS with respect thereto and, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or cause
the loss of, such qualification. The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have made
all required

                                       71

<PAGE>

application for a funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period
pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Plan.

        (b)     There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental Authority,
with respect to any Plan that could be reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or violation of the
fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan that has resulted or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

        (c)     (i) Other than as set forth on Schedule 5.12(c), no ERISA Event
                                               ----------------
has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur; (ii) no Pension Plan has a
Funded Current Liability Percentage of less than 90% as of the most recent
valuation date; (iii) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred,
or reasonably expects to incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA with
respect to any Pension Plan (other than premiums due and not delinquent under
Section 4007 of ERISA); (iv) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred, or reasonably expects to incur, any liability (and no event has
occurred which, with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would
result in such liability) under Sections 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan; and (v) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has
engaged in a transaction that could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of
ERISA.

        (d)     With respect to each retirement plan or arrangement mandated by
a government other than the United States (a "Foreign Government Scheme or
                                              ----------------------------
Arrangement") and with respect to each employee benefit plan maintained or

Subsidiaries other than those specifically disclosed in Part A of Schedule 5.13,
                                                                  -------------

contained in this Agreement or any other document (other than representations
and warranties with respect to the consolidated forecasted balance sheets and
statements of income of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries delivered to the
Lenders pursuant to Section 6.01 or contained in the Information Memorandum), or
                    ------------
any certificate or written statement furnished to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender by any Loan Party for use in connection with any transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, contains or will contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state or will omit to state a material fact known to
such Loan Party necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

        5.16    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. Each of the
Borrower and each Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements of its respective Contractual Obligations and all Laws and all
orders, writs, injunctions and decrees applicable to it or to its properties,

                                   ARTICLE IX.
                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

        9.01    Appointment and Authorization of the Administrative Agent and
Supplemental Collateral Agents.

        (a)     Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent

                                       110

<PAGE>

shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

        (b)     The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to
the Administrative Agent in this Article IX with respect to any acts taken or
                                 ----------
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for
letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative Agent" as used in this Article IX and in the definition of
                                       ----------
"Agent-Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C
Issuer.

        (c)     It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
that there shall be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or
restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact
business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case
of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in
particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case
the Administrative Agent deems that by reason of any present or future law of
any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies
granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action
which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary
that the Administrative Agent appoint an additional individual or institution as
a separate trustee, co-trustee, collateral agent or collateral co-agent (any
such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually
as a "Supplemental Collateral Agent" and collectively as "Supplemental
      -----------------------------                       ------------
Collateral Agents").
-----------------

        In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental
Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right,
power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the
Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and
vest in such Supplemental Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the
extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such
rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform
such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation
contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance
thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by
either the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and (ii)
the provisions of this Article IX and of Sections 10.04 and 10.05 that refer to
                       ----------        --------------     -----
the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental
Collateral Agent and all references therein to the

                                       111

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative
Agent and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require.

        Should any instrument in writing from the Borrower or any other Loan
Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by the
Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to
him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or
shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all
such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any
Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, to the extent permitted by
law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the
appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

        9.02    DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

        9.03    LIABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. No Agent-Related Person
shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be
responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer
thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure
of any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.

        9.04    RELIANCE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

        (a)     The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan
Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
so

                                       112

<PAGE>

requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or
consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be
expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

        (b)     For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
             ------------
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
specifying its objection thereto.

        9.05    NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with
respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to
be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default." The Administrative Agent will notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default as may be directed by the Required
Lenders in accordance with Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and
                           ------------  --------  -------
until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

        9.06    CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person
to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have
disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other

                                       113

<PAGE>

documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related
Person.

        9.07    INDEMNIFICATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on
behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party
to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however,
                                                            --------  -------
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of
any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the
--------  -------
Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations
and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

        9.08    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. CNA and its
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of
the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though CNA were not the
Administrative Agent or an L/C Issuer hereunder and without notice to or consent
of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, CNA
or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that
the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to its Loans, CNA shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights
and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent or an L/C Issuer, and
the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include CNA in its individual capacity.

        9.09    SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders; provided
                                                                    --------
that any such resignation by CNA shall also constitute its resignation as Swing
Line Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the
Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative
agent for the Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented
to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of
Default

                                       114

<PAGE>

(which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of
the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor
administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as
such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender and the
respective terms "Administrative Agent" and "Swing Line Lender" shall mean such
successor administrative agent and swing line lender, and the retiring
Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent
shall be terminated and the retiring Swing Line Lender's rights, powers and
duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on
the part of such retiring Swing Line Lender or any other Lender. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to
                       ----------     --------------     -----
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent
has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days
following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
agent as provided for above.

        9.10    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower)
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

        (a)     to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all
other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as
may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders
and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.10 and 10.04)
                                   ----------------     ---  ----     ------
allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

        (b)     to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent

                                       115

<PAGE>

and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent
under Sections 2.10 and 10.04.
      -------------     -----

        Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

        9.11    COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS. The Lenders irrevocably
authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to
enter into each Collateral Document as secured party on behalf of and for the
benefit of the Lenders and to be the agent for and representative of the Lenders
under the Guaranty, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each
Collateral Document and the Guaranty; provided that the Administrative Agent
                                      --------
shall not (i) enter into or consent to any material amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of any provision contained in any Collateral Document or
the Guaranty or (ii) release any Collateral (except as otherwise expressly
permitted or required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the applicable
Collateral Document), in each case without the prior consent of Required Lenders
(or, if required pursuant to Section 10.01, all Lenders); provided further,
                             -------------                ----------------
however, that, without further written consent or authorization from the
Lenders, the Administrative Agent may execute any documents or instruments
necessary to (a) release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the
subject of a sale or other disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement or
to which Required Lenders have otherwise consented, (b) release any Guarantor
from the Guaranty if all of the capital stock of such Guarantor is sold to any
Person (other than an Affiliate of the Borrower) pursuant to a sale or other
disposition permitted hereunder or to which Required Lenders have otherwise
consented or (c) subordinate Liens of the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the
Secured Parties, to any Liens permitted under Section 7.01; provided that in
                                                            -------- ----
each case the requirements of Section 10.19 are satisfied. Anything contained in
                              -------------
any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (x) no Lender shall have
any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral under any
Collateral Document or to enforce the Guaranty, it being understood and agreed
that all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents and the
Guaranty may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof, and (y) in the event of a
foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a
public or private sale, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the
purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and the
Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Lenders (but not
any Lender or the Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities
unless Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for
the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price
for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use
and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price
for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale.

        Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release
or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to
release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this
Section 9.11.

behalf and (iii) authorizes and empowers the Administrative Agent to
sub-delegate to third parties its powers as attorney-in-fact of each of the
Lenders.

        10.01   AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing

the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment,

that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary (i) to amend
the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to

or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;

        (d)     change Section 2.14 or Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter

in effect within each of the following classes of Commitments, Loans and other
Credit Extensions: (i) the class consisting of the Revolving Loan Commitments,
and (ii) the class consisting of the Tranche B Term Loan Commitments. For
purposes of this clause, the aggregate amount of each Lender's risk
participation and funded participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans
shall be deemed to be held by such Lender; or

        (i)     change any provision of Section 2.05(b) which has the effect of

changing any mandatory prepayments applicable to a class in a manner that
disproportionately disadvantages such class relative to any other class without
the prior written consent of Lenders having more than 50% of the Aggregate
Credit Exposures then in effect within the disadvantaged class of Commitments,
Loans and other Credit Extensions (it being understood and agreed that any
change of any such provision which only postpones or reduces any mandatory
prepayment applicable to one class but not any other class shall be deemed to
disproportionately disadvantage such class but not to disproportionately
disadvantage any other class for purposes of this clause). For purposes of this
clause, the aggregate amount of each Lender's risk participation and funded
participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be held

Agreement; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document; and (iv) Section 10.07(h) may not be amended, waived or
                                  ----------------
otherwise modified without the consent of each Granting Lender all or any part
of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment, waiver
or other modification; and (v) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or
privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder,
except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended
without the consent of such Lender.

        10.03   NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver

any Indemnitee have any liability for any special, indirect, consequential or

shall be payable within thirty days after demand therefor. The agreements in
this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the

        10.06   PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid
by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand
to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate from time to time in effect.

other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and
void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective

Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment
to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in
Section 10.07(g)) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the
-----------------
Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder)
subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative

assignment in respect of Tranche B Term Loan Commitments, unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld

                                       122

obligations in respect of Tranche B Term Loan Commitments and Revolving Loan
Commitments on a non-pro rata basis; (iii) any assignment of a Revolving Loan
Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer and
each Swing Line Lender unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself

recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.07(c), from
                                                          ----------------
and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the
Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
                                                                       --------

----  ----  ----  -----     -----

Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Tranche B Term Note and/or
a Revolving Loan Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this Section 10.07(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale
     ----------------
by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance
with Section 10.07(d).
     ----------------

        (c)     The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
                                                     --------
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

        (d)     Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
                           -----------
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C
Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such
                                                   --------
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
                                                           --------
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification
described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that directly affects such
                                  -------------
Participant. Subject to Section 10.07(e), the Borrower agrees that each
                        ----------------
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to
                                                 -------------  ----     ----
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(b). To the extent permitted by law, each
                       ----------------
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it
                                                      -------------
were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14 as
               --------                                          ------------
though it were a Lender.

        (e)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
              ------------    ----
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless
                                                             ------------
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section

10.15 as though it were a Lender.
-----

        (f)     Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its
Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no
                                                            --------
such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party

        (g)     As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:

        "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender;
         -----------------
(c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person)

(each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that
                                                                 --------

        (h)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
           ---------------
identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an "SPC") the option to provide all or
                                           ---
any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to
make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall
                                 --------
constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects
not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such
Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the
terms hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any
SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or
expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under
this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.04), (ii) no SPC shall
                                                -------------
be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement
for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all
purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification
of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.
The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that,
prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all
outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but
without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the
payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to
receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii)

funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of
any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of
the Loans owing to it and the Notes, if any, held by it to the trustee for
holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for
such obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee
                                --------
actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of
-------------
its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even
though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the
pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

        (j)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

                (i)     if at any time any Swing Line Lender assigns all of its
        Commitment and Loans pursuant to Section 10.07(b), such Swing Line
                                         ----------------
        Lender may, upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line
        Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Swing Line Lender, the
        Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Revolving Lenders a
        successor Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no
                                               --------  -------
        failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the
        resignation of such Swing

                                       125

<PAGE>

        Line Lender. Upon any such resignation, such Swing Line Lender shall
        retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder
        with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the
        effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the
        Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in
        outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c); and
                                                 ---------------

                (ii)    if at any time any L/C Issuer assigns all of its
        Commitment and Loans pursuant to Section 10.07(b), such L/C Issuer may,
                                         ----------------
        upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C
        Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrower
        shall be entitled to appoint from among the Revolving Lenders a
        successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by
                                        --------  -------
        the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation
        of such L/C Issuer. Upon any such resignation, such L/C Issuer shall
        retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with
        respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of
        its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect
        thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate
        Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
        Section 2.03(c)).
        ----------------

        10.08   CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party
to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of
or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such
contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor)
to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Loan
Parties; (g) with the consent of the Borrower; (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (i) to the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar
organization. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose
the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market
data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service
providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the
administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any
 -----------
Loan Party or its business, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by any Loan Party; provided that, in the case of information received
                              --------
from a Loan Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified
at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the

                                       126

<PAGE>

confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

        Notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent hereby agree that the Borrower (and each of its employees,
representatives and agents) is permitted to disclose to any and all Persons,
without limitation of any kind, the structure and tax aspects of the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, and all materials of any kind
(including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to the Borrower
related to such structure and tax aspects. In this regard, the Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that the Borrower's disclosure of the structure or tax
aspects of such transactions is not limited in any way by an express or implied
understanding or agreement, oral or written (whether or not such agreement or
understanding is legally binding). Furthermore, the Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that it does not know or have reason to know that its use or disclosure
of information relating to the structure or tax aspects of the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents is limited in any other manner for the
benefit of any other Person.

        10.09   SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without
prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being
waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by,
and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or
the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing
to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter
existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender
shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a
currency different from that of the applicable deposit or indebtedness. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after
any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that
                                                      --------  -------
the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off
and application.

        10.10   INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid
under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious
interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative
                                           ------------
Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if
it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining
whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative
Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal
as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

        10.11   COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument; signature pages may be
detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single
counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same
document.

        10.12   INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written
or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of
                                            --------
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

        10.13   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations
and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

        10.14   SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

        10.15   TAX FORMS. (a) (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States
person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign
                                                                  -------
Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any
------
payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment
of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form
W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling
it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be
made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS
Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to
such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other
evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such
Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code.
Thereafter

                                       128

<PAGE>

and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the
Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of
such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the
relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then
current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any available
exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of
all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to
it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably
necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any
requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

                (ii)    Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or
        ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any
        sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for
        example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender), shall
        deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date when such Foreign Lender
        ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any
        such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be necessary
        in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the reasonable
        exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies of the
        forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth
        above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with
        respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not
        subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed
        copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any
        information such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any
        other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code, to
        establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with
        respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender.

                (iii)   The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional
        amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with respect to any
                                           ------------
        Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the
        information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender
        transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 10.15(a) or
                                                           -------------
        (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing provisions
        of this Section 10.15(a); provided that if such Lender shall have
                ----------------  --------
        satisfied the requirement of this Section 10.15(a) on the date such
                                          ----------------
        Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect
        to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this Section
                                                                        -------
        10.15(a) shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts
        --------
        pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as a result of any change in
                    ------------
        any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or
        any change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof,
        such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms,
        certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the
        fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which such
        Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not
        subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

                                       129

<PAGE>

                (iv)    The Administrative Agent may, without reduction,
        withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payment
        under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the Borrower is
        not required to pay additional amounts under this Section 10.15(a).
                                                          ----------------

        (b)     Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that
is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies
of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

        (c)     If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax
or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all
penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate
Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of
the Administrative Agent.

        (b)     The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from

Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day
following receipt by such agent or Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in
such Other Currency such agent or Lender may in accordance with normal banking
procedures purchase the Original Currency with such Other Currency; if the
Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due such agent or
Lender in the Original Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation
and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such agent or Lender against
such loss, and if the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally
due to such agent or Lender in the Original Currency, such agent or Lender shall
remit such excess to such Borrower.

CITIGROUP PARTY IS FOUND IN A FINAL NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT BY A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO HAVE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SUCH CITIGROUP PARTY'S
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

        (d)     The Administrative Agent agrees that the receipt of the
Communications by the Administrative Agent at its e-mail address set forth
above shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the
Administrative Agent for purposes of this Agreement and the Loan Documents.

        Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to this Agreement
(or any Loan Document) in any other manner specified in this Agreement (or any
such Loan Document).

        (e)     Each Lender hereby agrees that notice to it (as provided in the
next sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Platform
shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for
purposes of this Agreement and the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees (i) to
notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic
communication) promptly after such Lender's acceptance of this Agreement (and
from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on
record an effective e-mail address for such Lender) of such Lender's e-mail
address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and
(ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address and shall be
deemed to be effective upon the posting of a record of such electronic
transmission as "sent" in the e-mail system of the Administrative Agent.
