Effect of Breach.  You acknowledge that the Company would be irreparably injured  by your violation of Section 3, and you agree that the Company , in addition to any other remedies  available to them for such breach or threatened breach, shall be entitled to a preliminary injunction,  temporary restraining order, or other equivalent relief, restraining you from any actual or  threatened breach of Section 3.

If any covenant or term of Sections 3 is determined  to be invalid or unenforceable in any instance, such determination shall not prevent the reassertion  thereof with respect of any other breach or violation. If, in any proceeding, a court (or other  tribunal) refuses to enforce the covenants contained in Sections 3 because such covenants cover  too extensive a geographic area or too long a period of time, any such covenant shall be deemed  amended to the extent (but only to the extent) required by law to permit its enforceability  hereunder.  You also agree that, if you ever challenge the validity of this Agreement, the First  Release or the Second Release or if you breach the terms of this Agreement, the First Release or  the Second Release or the terms of any applicable grant agreement pursuant to the LTIP, you will  forfeit your right to any unpaid payments pursuant to this Agreement and, if paid prior to such  breach, you agree to repay the Separation Payments to the Company together with an amount equal  to any gain received as a result of the RSU Distributions and the PSU Distributions.           5.4.  Severability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement  will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and this  Agreement will be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted (but only  to the extent that such provision cannot be appropriately reformed or modified); provided,  however, that if one or more provisions of the First and Second Release are invalid or  unenforceable, the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to have the entire Agreement treated  as invalid and unenforceable.         5.5.  Other Agreements.  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,  this instrument constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company and supersedes all  prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, including, without limitation, the  Employment Agreement and any other agreements that may have been made by and between you  and the Company or its predecessors or Affiliates; provided, however, that for the avoidance of  doubt, as noted in Section 3 of this Agreement, you agree that you remain bound by all applicable  terms of the LTIP and all award agreements for awards previously granted to you pursuant to the  LTIP.         5.6.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws  of the State of New York without regard to the conflict of law provisions of any state.         5.7.  Costs. The parties shall each bear their own costs, attorneys&#8217; fees and other fees  incurred in connection with this Agreement and the First and Second Release.                                            7 </FONT></DIV>
