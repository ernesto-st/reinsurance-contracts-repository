12:00&nbsp;p.m. (London time, in the case of Multicurrency Letters of Credit, and New York time in the case of Domestic Supported Foreign LCs and Domestic Letters of Credit) on the date specified
for the giving of such notice. Each such notice (each, a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Letter of Credit Request</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") shall be in the form of </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;2.10(b)-1</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto and shall

Foreign LC or a Multicurrency Letter of Credit and (G)&nbsp;such other information as Facing Agent may reasonably request. In addition, each Letter of Credit Request shall contain a description of
the terms and conditions to be included in such proposed Letter of Credit (all of which terms and conditions shall be acceptable in form to the applicable Facing Agent). Promptly after issuance or
extension of any Letter of Credit, the applicable Facing Agent shall notify the Administrative Agent of such issuance or extension and such notice of a Standby Letter of Credit shall be accompanied by
a copy of the Standby Letter of Credit. Unless otherwise specified, all Letters of Credit will be governed by the "Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits" or, in the case of a
Multicurrency Letter of Credit that is a bank guarantee, the "Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees" or applicable English law, in each case as in effect on the date of issuance of such Letter of

applicable Facing Agent will issue the requested Letter of Credit to the applicable beneficiary.
From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and prior to the Revolver Termination Date, the applicable Facing Agent will, upon the written request of the Borrower received by the Facing
Agent (with a copy sent by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent) at least three days (or such shorter time as the Facing Agent and the Administrative Agent may agree in a particular instance in
their sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of amendment, amend any Letter of Credit issued by it. Each such request for amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile, confirmed
immediately in an original writing, made in the form of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;2.10(b)-2</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto (each a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Letter of Credit
