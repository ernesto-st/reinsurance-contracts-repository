Absence" is a leave of absence, designated as a "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence", for an Employee or group of Employees that is approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources during
which an Employee who is not actively working for Dow may continue coverage under the Plan. Benefit Protected Leaves of Absences automatically expire after three (3)&nbsp;months, or upon the
Employee's return to Active Work with Dow, whichever occurs first. The Vice President of Human Resources may renew a Benefit Protected Leave of Absence. Such renewal must be in writing. You may also

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Reporting Imputed Income  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Internal Revenue Code requires that the cost of Company-Paid Life Insurance in excess of $50,000 be reported as taxable income ("imputed income"). This imputed income
will be reported on your W-2 Form in addition to your other taxable income. Former participants of The Dow Chemical Company Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan and the Union Carbide
Corporation Executive Life Insurance Plan are not eligible for the $50,000 exclusion. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cost of your Company-Paid Life Insurance in excess of $50,000 is based on a Uniform Premium Table established by the federal government. If you are an Hourly Employee of
Michigan Operations, the cost of your combined Company-Paid Life and Employee-Paid Life in excess of $50,000 is taxable income and is determined based on the Uniform Premium
Table established by the federal government. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Naming Your Beneficiary  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
designate your beneficiary on the Company-Paid Life Beneficiary Designation form, available from the Intranet or the HR Service Center. A contingent beneficiary is
recommended. If you fail to name a beneficiary, MetLife may determine the beneficiary to be one or more of the following who survive you: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you fail to name a beneficiary, instead of making payment to any of the above, MetLife may pay your estate. Any payment made by MetLife in good faith will discharge the Plan's and
MetLife's liability to the extent of such payment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may change your beneficiary whenever you choose by completing a beneficiary change form. Beneficiary changes are not effective until the date they are received by the Dow Benefits
Center, and are subject to approval by MetLife. You will receive written notification of your beneficiary change. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
beneficiary designations must conform to MetLife's administrative requirements. Your beneficiary designation may be returned to you for you to make changes to it if it does not
conform to MetLife's requirements. Beneficiary designations are not effective until MetLife has determined that they conform to MetLife's requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Payment Options</U>.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of your death, your beneficiary should

insurance proceeds. To file&nbsp;a Claim for a Plan Benefit, see Claims Procedures Appendix of this SPD. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Funding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dow
pays the entire premium for the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. MetLife pays the benefits under an insurance policy. MetLife may combine the experience for the policy
with other policies held by Dow. This means that the costs of these coverages may be determined on a combined basis, and the costs accumulated from year to year. Favorable experience under one or more
coverages in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience on other coverages in the same year or offset unfavorable experience of coverages in prior years. Policy dividends declared by MetLife
for the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan are used to reduce Dow's cost for the coverage in the same and prior years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO)  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Accelerated Benefit Option, if you have been diagnosed as having a terminal illness, you may receive a portion of your Company-Paid Life Insurance and
Employee-Paid Life Insurance benefits </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help ease financial and
emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Employee-Paid Life Insurance. You may receive an
accelerated benefit of up to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5000 and maximum $250,000) of your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or Employee-Paid Life Insurance if, as a result of
an injury or sickness you are diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the Dow
Benefits Center and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

Employee-Paid Life Insurance  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Plan Description  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan, you may select the amount of your coverage in multiples of one-half times (1/2X) your base annual salary up to two
and a half times (2<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL> X)&nbsp;or six times (6X) your base annual pay, depending on whether you are an Hourly Employee or you are a Salaried Employee. If you are an Hourly Employee,
the amount will depend on the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan is a group term life insurance plan. The benefits are insured by a group
term life insurance policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). MetLife pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as
to whether a Claim for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of January&nbsp;1, 2005, the following plans have been merged into the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan: Hampshire Chemical Corporation Hourly Optional Group Life
Insurance Program's Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan; ANGUS Chemical Company Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. Such plans no
longer exist as separate plans, but are now a part of the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan is referred to in Chapter Two as the "Plan". </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Eligibility  </B></FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> <U>Salaried Employees</U>  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaried
Employees of a Participating Employer with regular, active, Full-Time or Less-Than-Full-Time status are eligible. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> <U>Hourly Employees</U>  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility
of Hourly Employees depends on whether the applicable collective bargaining unit and the Participating Employer have agreed to this Plan. With respect to a collective
bargaining agreement that specifically addresses which Employees are eligible or not eligible for this Plan, the terms of such collective bargaining agreement shall govern. If the terms of the
collective bargaining agreement specify that Hourly Employees shall be provided this Plan, but does not specifically address the category of Employees that are eligible or not eligible, then the Plan
will provide eligibility to regular, active Employees with Full Time status who are members of the collective bargaining group. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> <U>Employees on a Leave of Absence</U>  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees
who are on a family or medical leave of absence approved by a Participating Employer, which leave of absence provides for eligibility for coverage under the Plan are eligible
for coverage as specified by the terms and conditions of the leave of absence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We no longer have educational or ambassador leaves as of 1/1/04; and the Sabbatical Leave no longer offers
life insurance, just six months of medical and dental. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are on a "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence", you are also eligible for coverage. A "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence" is a leave of absence, designated as a "Benefit Protected
Leave of Absence", for an Employee or group of Employees that is approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources during which an Employee who is not actively working for Dow may continue
coverage under the Plan. Benefit Protected Leaves of Absences automatically expire after three (3)&nbsp;months, or upon the Employee's return to Active Work with Dow, whichever occurs first. The
Vice President of Human Resources may renew a Benefit Protected Leave of Absence. Such renewal must be in writing. You may also be eligible if you are approved by the Participating Employer for
certain other leaves of absences. Check the Plan Document for more information. </FONT></P>

receive written notification of your beneficiary change. You may obtain a beneficiary form from the Dow Intranet or the HR Service Center. If you do not designate a beneficiary, then the default
beneficiary will be the same as the beneficiary on your Company-Paid Life Insurance. If you are not eligible for Company-Paid Life Insurance, and you are enrolled in
Post-65 Executive Life, then the default beneficiary is the same as your beneficiary for Post-65 Executive Life. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
beneficiary designations must conform to MetLife's administrative requirements. Your beneficiary designation may be returned to you for you to make changes to it if it does not
conform to MetLife's requirements. Beneficiary designations are not effective until MetLife has determined that they conform to MetLife's requirements. Once MetLife has determined that the designation
conforms with their requirements, the effective date of the designation is the date you signed the designation that conforms with their requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan are not
combined for experience with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan in a particular year may
offset unfavorable experience in prior years. It is not anticipated that there will be any dividends declared for the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance
Plan based on the manner in which the insurer has determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Joint Insurance Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorinco Reinsurance Company (Dorinco) and MetLife have entered into an arrangement that is allowed by the U.S. Department of Labor pursuant to Prohibited
Transaction Exemption 96-62 and 29 CFR Part&nbsp;2570, subpart B. [DOL Final Authorization Number 2001-17E (May&nbsp;14, 2001)]. Under this
arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco will
each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will transfer its percentage of each death
benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be obligated to pay the full amount of the
claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the entire amount of the claim. Neither MetLife nor
Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. </FONT></P>

Dependent Life Insurance  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Plan Description  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dependent Life Insurance Plan provides coverage for your eligible family members at group rates. The benefits are insured by a group term life insurance
policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). MetLife pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim
for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of January&nbsp;1, 2005, the following plans have been merged into the Dependent Life Insurance Plan: Hampshire Chemical Corporation Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's
Dependent Life Insurance Plan; ANGUS Chemical Company Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's Dependent Life Insurance Plan. Such plans no longer exist as separate plans, but are now a part of
the Dependent Life Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Dependent Life Insurance Plan is referred to in Chapter Three as the "Plan". </FONT></P>

eligible. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility
of Bargained-for Employees depends on whether the applicable collective bargaining unit and the Participating Employer have agreed to this Plan. With respect to a
collective bargaining agreement that specifically addresses which Employees are eligible or not eligible for this Plan, the terms of such collective bargaining agreement shall govern. If the terms of
the collective bargaining agreement specify that Bargained for Employees shall be provided this Plan, but does not specifically address the category of Employees that are eligible or not eligible,
then the Plan will provide eligibility to regular active Employees with Full Time status who are members of the collective bargaining group. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> <U>Employees on a Leave of Absence</U>:  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible
Employees on a family or medical leave of absence approved by Dow or a Participating Employer are also eligible to insure eligible Dependents under this Plan. If both you and
your Spouse/Domestic Partner are eligible Employees, each may insure the other, but only one of you may insure your Dependent children. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are on a "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence", you are also eligible to insure your eligible Dependent. A "Benefit Protected Leave of Absence" is a leave of absence, designated as
such, for an Employee or group of Employees that is approved in writing by the Vice President of Human Resources during which an Employee who is not actively working for Dow may continue coverage
under the Plan. Benefit Protected Leaves of Absences automatically expire after three (3)&nbsp;months, or upon the Employee's return to Active Work with Dow, whichever occurs first. The Vice
President of Human Resources may renew a Benefit Protected Leave of Absence. Such renewal must be in writing. </FONT></P>

your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or Dependent child's life insurance coverage is reduced due to retirement, the amount of coverage your Spouse of Record/Domestic
Partner of Record or Dependent child lost may be converted to an individual non-term policy through MetLife. The maximum amount of insurance that may be elected for the new policy is the
amount of Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or Dependent child life insurance you lost under the Dependent Life Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or Dependent child loses coverage under the Dependent Life Insurance Plan because of your death or because he or she no longer meets
eligibility requirements, their coverage may be converted to an individual non-term policy through MetLife. (In the case of minor children, the parent or legal guardian may act on their
behalf.) The maximum amount of insurance that may be elected for the new policy is the amount of Dependent Life Insurance that ends under the Dependent Life Insurance provisions of the MetLife group
policy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or Dependent child loses coverage under the Dependent Life Insurance Plan because Dow has cancelled the dependent life coverage under
the group policy with MetLife, or Dow has amended the eligibility requirements of the Plan to exclude you or your dependents from eligibility under the Plan, you may convert coverage to an individual
non-term MetLife policy for your Dependent; provided you have been enrolled in coverage for your Dependent under the Dependent Life Insurance Plan for at least 5&nbsp;years immediately

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A

the Dow HR Service Center to obtain a form for converting the coverage. Once the form has been obtained, you or your Dependent should contact the MetLife Conversion Group at
1-800-MET-LIFE or 1-800-638-5433. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cost of this individual coverage will probably be significantly higher than the group plan. Although not required, providing proof of insurability may help reduce the cost. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employee Contribution  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee pays for Dependent Life Insurance coverage. Your contribution, made through post tax payroll deductions, is based on the coverage option that you
choose. For coverage on your Spouse's/Domestic Partner's life, your contribution will also depend on whether your Spouse/Domestic Partner is a "non-tobacco-user". Your
Spouse/Domestic Partner is considered a "non-tobacco-user" by the Plan if your Spouse/Domestic Partner has not used a tobacco product in the last 12&nbsp;months. If your
Spouse/Domestic Partner quits using tobacco, your Spouse/Domestic Partner is considered a "non-tobacco-user" as of the first day of the month after your Spouse/Domestic Partner
completes 12 non-tobacco-using months. If your Spouse/Domestic Partner is a "non-tobacco-user", your Spouse/Domestic Partner is considered a
tobacco-user as of the first day your Spouse/Domestic Partner uses tobacco. A false or out-of-date statement regarding tobacco use may result in benefits not being
paid. For your portion of the monthly costs, refer to the Choices enrollment materials provided during annual enrollment. </FONT></P>

combined for experience with the other insurance coverages. Favorable experience under this insurance coverage in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience in prior years. It is not
anticipated that there will be any dividends declared for the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan and the Dependent Life Insurance Plan based on the manner in which the insurer has
determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Joint Insurance Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorinco Reinsurance Company (Dorinco) and MetLife have entered into an arrangement that is allowed by the U.S. Department of Labor pursuant to Prohibited
Transaction Exemption 96-62 and 29 CFR Part&nbsp;2570, subpart B. [DOL Final Authorization Number 2001-17E (May&nbsp;14, 2001)]. Under this
arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco will
each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will transfer its percentage of each death
benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be obligated to pay the full amount of the
claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the
entire amount of the claim. Neither MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. This joint
insurance arrangement is not applicable to coverage for Hourly Employees employed by Michigan Operations, or their Dependents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO) for Spouses/Domestic Partners Only  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Accelerated Benefit Option, if your Spouse/Domestic Partner is covered under Dependent Life Insurance and has been diagnosed as having a terminal
illness, you may receive a portion of his or her Dependent Life Insurance </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>before</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> death. Having access to life proceeds at this important time could help
ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, your Spouse/Domestic Partner must be covered for at least $10,000 from Dependent Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit of up
to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5000 and maximum $50,000) of Dependent Life if, as a result of an injury or sickness he or she is diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from
which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the Dow Benefits Center and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

addition to creating rights for you and all other Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for operating an employee benefit plan. The people who
operate the Plans, called "fiduciaries" of the Plans, have a duty to act prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
one, including your employer or any other person, may discharge you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit, or from exercising
your rights under ERISA. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the
decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the legal rights described above. For instance, if you request materials from one of the Plans and do not receive them within
30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must
file&nbsp;a written appeal within the time period specified in the Plan's Claims Procedures. Failure to comply with the Plan's claims procedures may significantly jeopardize your rights to benefits.
If you are not satisfied with the final appellate decision, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within 120&nbsp;days from the
date of the Claims Administrator's or the Plan Administrator's final written decision (or the deadline the Claims Administrator or Plan Administrator had to notify you of a decision). Failure to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The court will decide who should pay court costs and
legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds
your claim is frivolous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse one of the Plan's money, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>You Must File&nbsp;a Claim in Accordance with These Claims Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
"Claim" is a <U>written</U> request by a claimant for a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan benefit</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or an </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility
Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There are two kinds of Claims: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claim for Plan Benefits</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a request for benefits covered under the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>An </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a kind of Claim. It is a request for a determination as to whether a claimant is eligible to be a Participant or covered
Dependent under the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
must follow the claims procedures for either </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS or CLAIMS FOR AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, whichever applies to
your situation. See the applicable sections below entitled </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR ELIGIBILITY
DETERMINATIONS.</I></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Who Will Decide Whether to Approve or Deny My Claim?  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dow Chemical Company will approve or deny a Claim for an Eligibility Determination. The initial determination is made by the Dow Benefits Center. If you
appeal, the appellate decision is made by the Director of Global Benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
will approve or deny a Claim for Plan Benefits. MetLife is the Claims Administrator for both the initial determination and (if there is an appeal), the appellate determination. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>An Authorized Representative May Act on Your Behalf  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Authorized Representative may submit a Claim on behalf of a Plan Participant. The Plan will recognize a person as a Plan Participant's "Authorized
Representative" if such person submits a notarized document signed by the Participant stating that the Authorized Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Participant. A court order
stating that a person is authorized to submit Claims on behalf of a Participant will also be recognized by the Plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Authority of the Administrators and Your Rights Under ERISA  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrators have the full, complete, and final discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings of fact in order to carry out their
respective Claims decision-making responsibilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretations
and claims decisions by the Administrators are final and binding on Participants. If you are not satisfied with an Administrator's final appellate decision, you may
file&nbsp;a civil action against the Plan under s. 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so
within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Administrator's final written decision. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Information Required In Order to Be a "Claim":  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Claims that are requests for Plan benefits, the claimant must complete a MetLife claims form. Call the HR Service Center at
1-877/623-8079 to obtain a form. (Retirees should call the Retiree Service Center to obtain a form at 1-800/344-0661). In addition, you must attach a
<U>certified</U> death certificate (must be certified by the government authority, as exhibited by a "raised seal" on the certificate). You may request assistance from the Dow
Benefits Center (1-989/636-9556) if you need help completing the MetLife claims form. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may submit any additional information to the applicable Administrator when you submit your request for appeal. You may also request that the Administrator provide you copies of
documents, records and other information that is relevant to your Claim, as determined by the applicable Administrator under applicable federal regulations. Your request must be in writing. Such
information will be provided at no cost to you. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the applicable Administrator receives your written request to appeal the initial determination, the Administrator will review your Claim. Deference will not be given to the initial
adverse decision, and the appellate reviewer will look at the Claim anew. The person who will review your appeal will not be the same person as the person who made the initial decision to deny the
Claim. In addition, the person who is reviewing the appeal will not be a subordinate who reports to the person who made the initial decision to deny the Claim. The Administrator will notify you in
writing of its final decision. Such notification will be provided within a reasonable period, not to exceed 60&nbsp;days of the written request for appellate review, except that under special
circumstances, the Administrator may have up to an additional 60&nbsp;days to provide written notification of the final decision. If the Administrator needs such an extension, it will notify you
prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, state the reason why such an extension is needed, and indicate when it will make its determination. If the Administrator determines that it
does not have sufficient information to make a decision on the Claim prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, it will notify you. It will describe any additional material or
information necessary to submit to the Plan, and provide you with the deadline for submitting such information. The initial 60&nbsp;day time period for the Administrator to make a final written
decision, plus the 60&nbsp;day extension period (if applicable) are tolled from the date the notification of insufficiency is sent to you until the date on which it receives your response. ("Tolled"
means the "clock or time is stopped or suspended". In other words, the deadline for the Administrator to make its decision is "put on hold" until it receives the requested information). The tolling
period ends when the Administrator receives your response, regardless of the adequacy of your response. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Administrator has determined to that its final decision is to deny your Claim, the written notification of the decision will state the reason(s) for the denial and refer to the
pertinent Plan provision(s). </FONT></P>
