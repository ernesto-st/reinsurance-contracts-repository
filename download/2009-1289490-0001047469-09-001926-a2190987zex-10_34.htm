<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, Lender agrees to make Advances to Borrower in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of up to, but not to
exceed, the Maximum Availability less the sum of (i)&nbsp;the face amount of all undrawn letters of credit, plus (ii)&nbsp;the amount of all drawings under letters of credit which have not been
reimbursed by Borrower to Lender. Interest shall accrue and be payable in arrears only on sums advanced hereunder for the period of time outstanding. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Borrower may repay and
re-borrow Advances hereunder on a revolving basis. Although the outstanding principal of the Note may be zero from time to time, the Loan Documents will remain in full force and effect
until the Maturity Date, unless sooner terminated, and all Obligations are paid and performed in full. The obligation of Borrower to repay Advances will be evidenced by the Note. Upon the occurrence
of a Default or Event of Default, Lender may suspend or terminate its commitment to make Advances without notice to or consent of Borrower. </FONT></P>

at any time the outstanding balance of the Loan exceeds the then current Maximum Availability, Borrower shall within ten (10)&nbsp;Banking Days either

(B)&nbsp;the amount of all drawings under letters of credit which have not been reimbursed by Borrower to Lender to an amount less than or equal to the then current Maximum Availability, or
(ii)&nbsp;identify in writing to Lender a Property proposed to be added as a new Borrowing Base Property which Borrower in good faith believes will have a sufficient Adjusted (LTV) Appraised Value
and Initial Debt Service Coverage Ratio Value to provide sufficient Maximum Availability to exceed the outstanding balance of the Loan plus sum of (A)&nbsp;the face amount of all undrawn letters of
credit, plus (B)&nbsp;the amount of all drawings under letters of credit which have not been reimbursed by Borrower to Lender. In the event that Borrower identifies any such proposed replacement
Property, such Property must be approved as a Borrowing Base Property and shall otherwise meet all conditions of a Borrowing Base Property within sixty (60)&nbsp;days. If such approval is not
provided by Lender or any of such conditions are not satisfied, then Borrower shall within two (2)&nbsp;Banking Days make the payment to Lender required by subsection&nbsp;(i) above. </FONT></P>

has proposed that Lender initially consider the Properties described in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;6</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> for acceptance by
Lender as Borrowing Base Properties. Lender is currently conducting due diligence on such Properties in accordance with </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Section&nbsp;4.1</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereof and
the other terms and conditions hereof, but to date has not received all information required to consider approving any such Properties as Borrowing Base Properties. Such approval, if any, shall be

<UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lender
may accelerate all of Borrower's, Guarantor's and each Permitted Subsidiary's Obligations under the Loan Documents whereupon such Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without notice of default, acceleration or intention to accelerate, presentment or demand for payment, protest or notice of nonpayment or dishonor, or notices or demands
of any kind or character (all of which are hereby waived by Borrower, Guarantor and each Permitted Subsidiary). </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lender

may enter into possession of any or all of the Properties and perform any and all work and labor necessary to complete any then pending construction at any or all
of the Properties, including any construction of tenant improvements pursuant to executed Lease, and to employ watchmen to protect any or all of the Properties and the Improvements. All sums expended
by Lender for such purposes shall be deemed to have been advanced to Borrower under the Note and shall be secured by the Security Instrument. For this purpose, Borrower hereby constitutes and appoints
Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution, which power is coupled with an interest, to complete the work in the name of Borrower, and hereby

release, regardless of consideration, of all or any part of the Property. No delay or omission of Lender to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing upon the happening of an Event of Default shall
impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein. No delay or omission on the part of Lender to exercise any option
for acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations, or for foreclosure of the Security Instrument following any Event of Default as aforesaid, or any other option granted to Lender hereunder in any
one or more instances, or the acceptance by Lender of any partial payment on account of the Obligations shall constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default and each such option shall remain
continuously in full force and effect. No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Lender is intended to be exclusive of any other remedies provided for in the Loan Documents, and each and every
such remedy shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder, or under the Loan Documents, or now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or by statute. Every
right, power and remedy given by the Loan Documents to Lender shall be concurrent and may be pursued separately, successively or together against Borrower, Guarantor and each Permitted Subsidiary or
any Property or any part thereof, and every right, power and remedy given by the Loan Documents may be exercised from time to time as often as may be deemed expedient by Lender. All notice and cure
periods provided in this Agreement or in any Loan Document shall run concurrently with any notice or cure periods provided by law. </FONT></P>

Lender to pay all installments of Taxes levied against the Property and all insurance premiums for insurance required to be maintained by Borrower under the Loan Documents, in each case coming due
during the upcoming twelve (12)&nbsp;month period. Required payments hereunder shall be added together with the regular payments under the Note and with any other sums required under the Loan
Documents, all of which shall be paid monthly as an aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender until the Obligations are paid and performed in full. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, funds paid by
Borrower hereunder shall not be or be deemed to be escrow or trust funds. At Lender's option, such funds may be held in an individual account, consolidated with other like accounts, or commingled with
the general funds of Lender. Such funds shall be held in an interest-bearing account in the name of Lender and all interest shall be credited to Borrower. Borrower agrees that it shall include all
interest and earnings on such funds paid to or deposited with Lender as its income (and, if Borrower is a partnership or other pass-through entity, the income of its partners, members or

delinquency date for such expense, real property Taxes and insurance premiums for which Borrower has provided invoices to Lender in advance. In its sole and absolute discretion, Lender may retain a
third party tax lien service to obtain tax certificates or other evidence or estimates of Taxes due or to become due and Borrower shall promptly reimburse Lender for the cost of retaining any such
service. Any unpaid reimbursements for any tax lien service will be added to the Obligations. Borrower shall ensure Lender's receipt, at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the respective due date
for payment, of all bills, invoices and statements for all Taxes and insurance premiums to be paid. Lender shall not be responsible for the payment of any invoice if Borrower has not paid to Lender
sufficient funds for such item under this </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;4</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, even if the shortfall results from Lender's failure to adequately estimate and collect
sufficient funds to satisfy such charges. In making any payment for Taxes or insurance hereunder, Lender shall be entitled to rely on any tax lien service or any bill, statement or estimate procured
from the appropriate public office or insurance company or agent without any inquiry into the accuracy, validity, enforceability or contestability of any Taxes, valuation, sale, forfeiture, tax lien
or title or claim thereof. </FONT></P>

grants to Lender a security interest in all funds paid to or deposited with Lender hereunder, and any proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations. Such
security interest shall be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code of the State, and Lender shall have available to it all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party thereunder. Borrower
shall have no right to unilaterally demand payment of or to withdraw funds deposited with Lender hereunder except as expressly permitted hereby. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Borrower
agrees that Lender may apply any funds paid to or deposited with Lender hereunder to cure the default. </FONT></P>
