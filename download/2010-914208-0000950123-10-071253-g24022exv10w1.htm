contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the
&#147;<U>Maximum Rate</U>&#148;). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an
amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the
Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrowers. In determining whether
the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds
the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a)&nbsp;characterize any
payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b)&nbsp;exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in
equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder.

Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a)&nbsp;the legality, validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not
be affected or impaired thereby and (b)&nbsp;the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to
replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect
of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.
The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions
of this <U>Section&nbsp;8.19</U>, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in
this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by the bankruptcy code of the United
States or any comparable bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization or other debtor
relief laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing
Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent
not so limited.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This <B>GUARANTY </B>dated May&nbsp;24, 2010 made by <B>INVESCO ADVISERS</B>, <B>INC.</B>, a Delaware corporation,
<B>INVESCO NORTH AMERICAN HOLDINGS, INC.</B>, a Delaware corporation, and <B>INVESCO MANAGEMENT GROUP INC.</B>, a
Delaware corporation (each, individually, a &#147;<U>Guarantor</U>&#148; and collectively, the
&#147;<U>Guarantors</U>&#148;), in favor of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and each of the Lenders
(as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. The Lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, L/C
Issuer and Swing Line Lender are parties to a Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (said
Agreement, as it may hereafter be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, being the &#147;<U>Credit Agreement</U>&#148;, the terms defined therein are used herein as therein
defined) with Invesco Holding Company Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and
Wales (&#147;<U>IHCL</U>&#148;), IVZ, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>IVZ</U>&#148;, and together with IHCL,
collectively, the &#147;<U>Borrowers</U>&#148; and each individually, a &#147;<U>Borrower</U>&#148;) and Invesco Ltd.
(the &#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;). The Guarantors may receive a portion of the proceeds of the Advances under
the Credit Agreement and will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the transactions
contemplated by the Credit Agreement. It is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the
Credit Agreement and the making of Advances by the Lenders thereunder that the Guarantors shall
have executed and delivered this Guaranty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to induce the Lenders to make
Advances under the Credit Agreement from time to time, each Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. <U>Guaranty; Limitation of Liability</U>. (a)&nbsp;Each Guarantor hereby, jointly and
severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of each other Loan Party now or
hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or
otherwise (such obligations, including, without limitation, the obligations of the Borrowers under
<U>Section&nbsp;2.15</U> of the Credit Agreement, being the &#147;<U>Guaranteed Obligations</U>&#148;), and
agrees to pay any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor&#146;s liability shall extend to all
amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by a Loan Party to the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender under the Loan Documents but for the fact that
they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or
similar proceeding involving such Loan Party.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be joint and several and
unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of any Loan Document, the
absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by the Administrative Agent, the
L/C Issuer or any Lender with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any
judgment against either Borrower, any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstance which
might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor (other than a
defense of payment in full or complete performance). Each

claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of either Borrower, any right to
require a proceeding first against such Borrower, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and
covenants that this Guaranty shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the
obligations contained in the Credit Agreement, the Notes and this Guaranty. This Guaranty is a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent, the L/C
Issuer and each Lender, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this
Guaranty and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance for purposes of bankruptcy law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to
this Guaranty and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing
intention, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Lenders and each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall be
limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such Guarantor under this

of the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to exercise any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against
either Borrower that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such
Borrower&#146;s obligations under the Credit Agreement and each Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this
Guaranty, in any such instance including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, and any right to participate in any
claim or remedy of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Lenders against either Borrower,
whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common
law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from either Borrower, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on
account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to a Guarantor in violation of
the preceding sentence and any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such
amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in
trust for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Lenders and shall forwith
be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations in
favor of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, whether matured or unmatured, in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive
direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents and
that the waiver set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;2</U> is knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

of its obligations shall be payable in the currency or currencies in which such obligations are
denominated, and shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any kind
or nature.

</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This <B>GUARANTY </B>dated May&nbsp;24, 2010 made by <B>INVESCO LTD.</B>, a company organized under the laws of
Bermuda (the &#147;<U>Guarantor</U>&#148;), in favor of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and each of
the Lenders (as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. The Lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, L/C
Issuer and Swing Line Lender are parties to a Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (said
Agreement, as it may hereafter be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, being the &#147;<U>Credit Agreement</U>&#148;, the terms defined therein are used herein as therein
defined) with Guarantor, Invesco Holding Company Limited, a company organized under the laws of
England and Wales (&#147;<U>IHCL</U>&#148;) and IVZ, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with IHCL,
collectively, the &#147;<U>Borrowers</U>&#148; and each individually, a &#147;<U>Borrower</U>&#148;). The Guarantor
may receive a portion of the proceeds of the Advances under the Credit Agreement and will derive
substantial direct and indirect benefit from the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.
It is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement and the making of
Advances by the Lenders thereunder that the Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this
Guaranty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to induce the Lenders to make
Advances under the Credit Agreement from time to time, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1. <U>Guaranty; Limitation of Liability</U>. (a)&nbsp;The Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of each other Loan Party now or
hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or
otherwise (such obligations, including, without limitation, the obligations of the Borrowers under
<U>Section&nbsp;2.15</U> of the Credit Agreement, being the &#147;<U>Guaranteed Obligations</U>&#148;), and
agrees to pay any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor&#146;s liability shall extend to all
amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by a Loan Party to the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender under the Loan Documents but for the fact that
they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or
similar proceeding involving such Loan Party.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional,
irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of any Loan Document, the absence of any
action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or
any Lender with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against
either Borrower, any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstance which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Guarantor (other than a defense of
payment in full or complete performance). The Guarantor hereby waives the benefit of diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or
bankruptcy of either Borrower, any right to require a proceeding first

Guaranty shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent, the L/C
Issuer and each Lender, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this
Guaranty and the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance for purposes of bankruptcy law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to
this Guaranty and the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing
intention, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Lenders and the Guarantor hereby
irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall be
limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such Guarantor under this

of the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to exercise any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against
either Borrower that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such
Borrower&#146;s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Guarantor&#146;s obligations under this
Guaranty, in any such instance including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, and any right to participate in any
claim or remedy of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Lenders against either Borrower,
whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common
law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from either Borrower, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on
account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation
of the preceding sentence and any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid in full,
such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to the Guarantor for the benefit of, and held
in trust for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Lenders and shall
forwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed
Obligations in favor of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, whether matured
or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. The Guarantor acknowledges that
it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the
Loan Documents and that the waiver set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;2</U> is knowingly made in
contemplation of such benefits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3. <U>No Set-Off</U>. Each payment to be made by the Guarantor hereunder in respect
of its obligations shall be payable in the currency or currencies in which such obligations are
denominated, and shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any kind
or nature.

Guaranteed Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full. The obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder shall not be affected, impaired or diminished in any way by any act, omission, matter
