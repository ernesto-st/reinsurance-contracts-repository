The  parties  recognize  Employee  may take  part  in  attaining and  developing,                           and/or otherwise will have access to Company's Confidential Information in                           the course of Employee's employment with Company.                          c. The parties further recognize protecting Company's Confidential Information                           from  disclosure  to  others  not  only  benefits  Company,  but  also  benefits  all                           Company employees who remain in Company's employ, as their livelihood is                           dependent upon the preservation of Company's Business.                    4.

NON-DISCLOSURE  OR  USE  OF  COMPANY'S  CONFIDENTIAL            INFORMATION.  Employee  shall  refrain  from  directly  or  indirectly  disclosing to any third            party, using for any purpose other than for the direct benefit of Company, or communicating in            any  manner,  any  of  Company's  Confidential  Information  during  Employee's  employment  and            thereafter, whatever the reason for Employee leaving Company's employ.                    6.

During  Employee&#8217;s  employment  with  the            Company  and  for  a  period  of  one  year  thereafter,  whatever   the   reason   for   Employee's            termination  of  employment,  Employee  shall  not,  either  directly or  indirectly,  either  on            Employee&#8217;s  own  behalf  or  on  behalf  of  another  business  or  individual,  engage  in  any  of  the            following  activities,  or  assist  others  in  such  activities,  in  any  geographic  location  where            Company's Business is or may be conducted:                          a.

The parties to this  Agreement  recognize            irreparable harm would result from any breach by Employee of the covenants contained in this            Agreement and monetary damages alone would not provide adequate relief for any such breach.            Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy which may be available to Company, if Employee            breaches a restrictive covenant in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge injunctive and other            relief  in  favor  of  Company  is  proper  and  may  be  ordered  by  any state  or  federal  court  of            competent jurisdiction located in Broward County, Florida.                    10.   TRADE SECRETS. Company and Employee's rights and obligations under this            Agreement  shall  be  cumulative  and  in  addition  to  any  rights  Company  may  have  to  protect            Company's Confidential Information that may constitute trade secrets under applicable law.                    11.   COSTS  AND  ATTORNEYS'  FEES.  If  either  party  seeks  to  enforce  any            provision(s)  in  this  Agreement  in  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  and  secures  any  relief,  the            prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in enforcing this            Agreement.                    12.   EXTENSION  OF  RESTRICTIVE  COVENANT  DURING  BREACH.  If            Employee  breaches  a  covenant  containing  a  specified  duration,  the  duration  of  that  covenant            shall  be  extended  by  the  period  of  time  between  Employee's  termination  of  employment  with            Company and the date a court of competent jurisdiction enters an injunction restraining further            breach  of  the  covenant.  Additionally,  if  Employee  breaches  any restrictive  covenant  in  this            Agreement, Employee forfeits Employee&#8217;s right to any compensation payable while Employee is            breaching such covenant or after any such breach has occurred.                    13.   SERVICE OF PROCESS.  If Company determines Employee has breached this            Agreement, Employee shall become available for service of process within the State of Florida.                    14.   JUDICIAL  MODIFICATION  OF  COVENANTS.  If  a  court  of  competent            jurisdiction determines any of the restrictions in this Agreement are overbroad, Employee shall            agree to modification of the affected restriction(s) to permit enforcement to the maximum extent            allowed by law.                    15.   INDEPENDENT  AGREEMENTS.  The  agreements  and  covenants  in            Paragraphs  5-8  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  construed  as  agreements  independent  of  any  other            provision  of  this  Agreement  or  in  any  other  agreement  by,  between,  among,  or  affecting            Company and Employee, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Employee against            Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to            the  enforcement  of  any  of  the  agreements  or  covenants  in  those Paragraphs. The  covenants,            agreements,  and  representations  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  will  survive  termination  of  this            Agreement and termination of Employee's employment.                    16.   AT-WILL  EMPLOYMENT/NO  DUTY  TO  EMPLOY.   Employee            understands  that  this  Agreement  does  not  constitute  a  contract of  employment  or  obligate  the            Company  to  employ  Employee  for  any  stated  period  of  time.  Nothing  contained  in  this            Agreement  shall  limit  the  ability  of  either  Employee  or  the  Company  to  terminate  the            employment relationship at will, with or without cause, at any time.                    17.   SUCCESSORS  AND  ASSIGNS. Company's  rights  and  obligations  under  this            Agreement  may  be  assigned  at  the  Company's  discretion  to  any  successor  or  assign.

WAIVER OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHT. The failure of either party to enforce            any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of that party's            right  to  subsequently  enforce  and  compel  strict  compliance  with  every  provision  of  this            Agreement.                    23.
