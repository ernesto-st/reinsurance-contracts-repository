<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><u>GUARANTY AGREEMENT</u></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Guaranty Agreement (the &#147;Guaranty&#148;) is made this 24th day of
November, 2003 between LOEWS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Guarantor&#148;),
and CONTINENTAL CASUALTY COMPANY, an Illinois insurance company (&#147;Company&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>WITNESSETH:</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNA Financial
Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (&#147;CNAF&#148;) and Guarantor owns approximately
90% of the outstanding shares of common stock of CNAF; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (&#147;Subsidiaries&#148;) are
engaged in the businesses of selling financial protection to individuals
through term life insurance, universal life insurance, annuities and other
products (the &#147;Life Business&#148;) and providing group life and group health
insurance and related services to employers, affinity groups and other entities
that purchase insurance as a group (the &#147;Group Business&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Company and the Subsidiaries plan to dispose of, through one or
more sales of assets or Subsidiary stock or through a reinsurance transaction
or other transfer or disposition, all or portions of the Group Business (any
such transaction being a &#147;Group Transaction&#148;) and the Life Business (any such
transaction being a &#147;Life Transaction&#148; and together with the Group Transaction,
the &#147;Transactions&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, if consummated, the Transactions will each generate proceeds for
the Company and are expected to increase the Company&#146;s surplus and Guarantor,
CNAF and the Company will directly and/or indirectly benefit therefrom; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, CNAF and the Company have requested Guarantor, and Guarantor has
agreed, to provide support to CNAF and the Company and in furtherance thereof
have entered into a Capital Support Agreement dated November&nbsp;12th, 2003 among
Guarantor, CNAF and the Company (the &#147;Capital Support Agreement&#148;) pursuant to
which, among other things, Guarantor agreed to provide the financial
accommodations set forth in this Guaranty, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and therein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
and covenants hereinafter set forth, Guarantor and the Company hereby agree as
follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<u>GUARANTY</u>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;<u>Agreement to Purchase Surplus Notes of the Company</u>. If a Group Trigger
(as defined below) occurs on or prior to February&nbsp;26, 2004 (the &#147;Trigger
Date&#148;), then on February&nbsp;27, 2004 or such earlier date as may be agreed upon
between the Company and the Guarantor (the &#147;Purchase Date&#148;) Guarantor shall
purchase a Group Surplus Note (as defined below) from the Company. If a Life
Trigger (as defined below) occurs on or prior to February&nbsp;26, 2004, then on the
Purchase Date Guarantor shall purchase a Life Surplus Note (as defined below)
from the Company.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. &#147;Group Trigger&#148; means that as of the close of business on the
Trigger Date, either a) a Group Transaction has not occurred or b) if a
Group Transaction has occurred and the amount by which the Company&#146;s
statutory surplus has increased as a result of the Group Transaction is
less than $200&nbsp;million. Such determination shall be made based upon the
Company&#146;s underlying statutory equity, adjusted for unamortized goodwill,
of CNA Group Life Assurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, as
reflected in its third quarter 2003 statutory financial statement filed
with its domiciliary regulator (the amount by which such increase is less
than $200&nbsp;million is the &#147;Group Amount&#148;).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. &#147;Life Trigger&#148; means that as of the close of business on the
Trigger Date, either a) a Life Transaction has not occurred or b) if a
Life Transaction has occurred, and the amount by which the Company&#146;s
statutory surplus has increased as a result of the Life Transaction is
less than $300MM (the amount by which such increase is less than $300
million is the &#147;Life Amount&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;<u>Amount and Form of Surplus Note(s)</u>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. If a Group Trigger occurs, then on the Purchase Date Guarantor
will purchase from the Company, and the Company will execute and deliver
to Guarantor against payment therefore, a surplus note in the form and
having the terms set forth in the form of Group Surplus Note attached as
Exhibit&nbsp;A hereto (the &#147;Group Surplus Note&#148;). The original principal
amount of the Group Surplus Note shall be the lesser of a) $200&nbsp;million
or b) the Group Amount .



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. If a Life Trigger occurs, then on the Purchase Date Guarantor
will purchase from the Company, and the Company will execute and deliver
to Guarantor against payment therefore, a surplus note in the form and
having the terms set forth in the form of Life Surplus Note attached as
Exhibit&nbsp;B hereto (the &#147;Life Surplus Note&#148;). The original principal
amount of the Life Surplus Note shall be the lesser of a) $300&nbsp;million or
b) the Life Amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<u>DEMANDS AND NOTICE</u>. Promptly following the occurrence of either a Group
Trigger or a Life Trigger, but in no event later than the Trigger Date, the
Company shall make a demand upon Guarantor (a &#147;Demand&#148;). A Demand shall be in
a writing signed by the Company&#146;s Chief Financial Officer and shall reasonably
and briefly specify the nature of the event and the calculation of the original
principal amount of the Group Surplus Note and/or the Life Surplus Note to be
purchased by Guarantor, with a specific statement that the Company is calling
upon Guarantor to perform under this Guaranty. A Demand satisfying the
foregoing requirements shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it
must perform under this Guaranty.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<u>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</u>. Guarantor&#146;s obligation to purchase a
Group Surplus Note or a Life Surplus Note hereunder shall be subject to the
condition that the representations and warranties made by the Company and CNAF
in the Capital Support Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects on the date the Demand is delivered to Guarantor hereunder as if made
on and as of such date and CNAF and CCC shall have performed in all material
respects all of their agreements and obligations hereunder and under the
Capital Support Agreement.

Life Trigger, the Company may take whatever action at law or in equity to
protect and enforce its rights or remedies, including without limitation
specific performance of any covenant, agreement, or other provision contained

payment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1.&nbsp;Term. This Surplus Note shall have a term of twenty (20)&nbsp;years (&#147;Term&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Assume that the Life Surplus Notes are funded at $300&nbsp;million on February&nbsp;15,
2004. On August&nbsp;11, 2004, the Life Transaction occurs and is completed in the
form of a reinsurance transaction. Assume that on August&nbsp;16, 2004 (the
mandatory prepayment date), the amount of accrued and unpaid interest owed by
the Company to the Noteholder is $9,050,000. Also, assume that the Director of
the Illinois Department of Insurance consents to the payment of each of the
amounts upon the closing of the Life Transaction and that there are no tax
consequences from the Life Transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1.&nbsp;The ceding commission and the related increase in surplus to the Company
from the Life Transaction is $500&nbsp;million. The Company will owe the Noteholder
$309,050,000 which is the entire principal balance along with all accrued and
unpaid interest.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">2.&nbsp;The ceding commission and the related increase in surplus to the Company
from the Life Transaction is $200,000,000. The Company will owe the Noteholder
$200,000,000 which represents $9,050,000 in accrued and unpaid interest and a
reduction in outstanding principal of $190,950,000.

2004. On August&nbsp;11, 2004, a portion of the Life Transaction occurs and is
completed in the form of a reinsurance transaction. Assume that on August&nbsp;16,
2004 (the first mandatory prepayment date), the amount of accrued and unpaid
interest owed by the Company to the Noteholder is $9,050,000. Also assume that
the ceding commission and the related increase in surplus to the Company from
the first Life Transaction is $200,000,000. The Company will owe the
Noteholder $200,000,000 which represents $9,050,000 in accrued and unpaid
interest and a reduction in outstanding principal of $190,950,000 with a
remaining outstanding principal balance of $109,050,000. Assume further that
the remainder of the Life Transaction occurs in the form of a sale of the
businesses on February&nbsp;10, 2005 and the second repayment date is February&nbsp;15,
2005. On February&nbsp;15, 2005, the amount of accrued and unpaid interest from
August&nbsp;16, 2004 is $3,253,325. Also, assume that the Director of the Illinois
Department of Insurance consents to the payment of each of the amounts upon the
closing of the Life Transactions and that there are no tax consequences from
the Life Transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1.&nbsp;The sale of the businesses in the second Life Transaction is $300&nbsp;million.

$46,746,675 of the outstanding principal and $3,253,325 in accrued and unpaid
interest. The outstanding principal balance after the second mandatory
prepayment date will be $62,303,325.

approves such payment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1.&nbsp;Term. This Surplus Note shall have a term of twenty (20)&nbsp;years (&#147;Term&#148;).

written approval of the Director, following the consummation of a

outstanding principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on this
Surplus Note and (y)&nbsp;an amount equal to the increase in the

Such determination shall be made based upon the Company&#146;s
underlying statutory equity, adjusted for unamortized goodwill, of
CNA Group Life Assurance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, as
reflected in its third quarter 2003 statutory financial statement
filed with its domiciliary regulator. &#147;Group Transaction&#148; means

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">Attachment A



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">Mandatory Principal Prepayment Example



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Assume that the Group Surplus Notes are funded at $200,000,000 on February&nbsp;15,
2004. Further assume that the Company&#146;s underlying statutory equity, adjusted
for unamortized goodwill, of CNA Group Life Assurance Company (GLA), a
subsidiary of the Company, as reflected in its third quarter 2003 statutory
financial statement filed with its domiciliary regulator is $500,000,000. On
August&nbsp;11, 2004, the Group Transaction occurs and is completed in the form of a
sale of GLA. Assume that on August&nbsp;16, 2004 (the mandatory prepayment date),
the amount of accrued and unpaid interest owed by the Company to the Noteholder
is $6,033,333.33. Also, assume that the Director of the Illinois Department of
Insurance consents to the payment of each of the amounts upon the closing of
the Group Transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;GLA is sold for $1,000,000,000 and the related increase in surplus to the
Company from the Group Transaction is $500,000,000. The Company will owe the
Noteholder $206,033,333.33 which is the entire principal balance along with all
accrued and unpaid interest.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;GLA is sold for $510,000,000 and the related increase in surplus to the
Company from the Group Transaction is $10,000,000. The Company will owe the
Noteholder $10,000,000 which represents $6,033,333.33 in accrued and unpaid
interest and a reduction in outstanding principal of $3,966,666.67 with a
remaining outstanding principal balance of $196,033,333.33.
