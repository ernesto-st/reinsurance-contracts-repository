     The foregoing definitions shall be equally applicable to both the singular

                                   ARTICLE III

                                   THE CREDIT
                                   ----------

     2.1 Generally. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Lenders severally agree to make a single initial Advance through the
Administrative Agent to Borrower in the amount of the Aggregate Commitment.

     Each Lender shall fund its Percentage of such initial Advance and no Lender
will be required to fund any amounts which would exceed such Lender's
Commitment. This facility ("Facility") is not a revolving credit facility and,
therefore, notwithstanding repayment of all or any portion of such Advance, the
Borrower shall have no right to reborrow Advances thereafter. For convenience,
portions of such single initial disbursement bearing different interest rates
are referred to herein as "Advances" but such reference shall not be deemed in
any way to create such a revolving credit facility.

     2.2 Ratable Advances. The initial Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans
made from the several Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio their
respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment and may be Floating Rate
Advances, LIBOR Rate Advances or a combination thereof, selected by the Borrower
in accordance with Section 2.7.

     2.3 Final Principal Payment. Any outstanding Advances and all other unpaid
Obligations shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the Facility Termination
Date.

     2.4 Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay an upfront fee to the Administrative
Agent on the date of the initial Advance equal to sixty one hundredth of one
percent (0.6%) of the Aggregate Commitment.

     2.5 Intentionally Omitted.

     2.6 Optional Prepayments; Mandatory Prepayments.

          (a) The Borrower may, upon at least one (1) Business Day's notice to
     the Administrative Agent, prepay all or any portion of the Advances, which
     notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and whether the
     prepayment is of LIBOR Rate Advances or Floating Rate Advances, or a
     combination thereof, and if a combination thereof, the amount allocable to
     each; provided, however, that (i) any partial prepayment under this
     Subsection shall be in an amount not less than $1,000,000 or a whole
     multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and; (ii) any LIBOR Rate Advance
     prepaid on any day other than the last day of the applicable LIBOR Interest
     Period must be accompanied by any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.4.
     Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly
     notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount
     specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified
     therein, together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.4.

          (b) If GPLP shall either replace the GPLP Revolver with a new facility
     or amend and restate the GPLP Revolver to increase the aggregate commitment
     available thereunder, then, the Borrower shall make a mandatory prepayment


                                      -12-
<PAGE>

     of the Loans in an amount sufficient to reduce the outstanding Advances
     hereunder to $25,000,000 or less upon the date of such a replacement or
     amendment and restatement. The failure of the Borrower to make any
     prepayment as required under this subsection shall constitute a Default
     under this Agreement. Each prepayment required to be made under this
     subsection shall include any amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.4. Such
     prepayment shall be of applied first to Floating Rate Advances, and then to
     LIBOR Rate Advances.

     2.7 Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods. The Borrower shall
select the Type of each Advance comprising the initial disbursement hereunder
and, in the case of each LIBOR Rate Advance, the Interest Period applicable to
such Advance from time to time. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent
irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") in the form attached as Exhibit G
hereto (i) not later than 1:00 p.m. Cleveland time on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Borrowing Date of each Floating Rate Advance, and (ii)
not later than noon Cleveland time, at least three (3) Business Days before the
Borrowing Date for each LIBOR Rate Advance:

               (i) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
          Advance,

               (ii) the aggregate amount of such Advance,

               (iii) the Type of Advance selected, and

               (iv) in the case of each LIBOR Rate Advance, the LIBOR Interest
          Period applicable thereto.

     Each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans, in funds immediately
available in Cleveland to the Administrative Agent at its address specified
pursuant to Article XIII on each Borrowing Date not later than (i) 11:00 a.m.
(Cleveland time), in the case of Floating Rate Advances which have been
requested by a Borrowing Notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than
1:00 p.m. (Cleveland time) on the Business Day immediately preceding such
Borrowing Date, or (ii) noon (Cleveland time) in the case of all other Advances.
The Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders
available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

     No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date and, unless
the Lenders otherwise agree in writing, in no event may there be more than six
(6) different Interest Periods for LIBOR Rate Advances outstanding at any one
time.

     2.8 Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating Rate
Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating
Rate Advances are converted into LIBOR Rate Advances. Each LIBOR Rate Advance
shall continue as a LIBOR Rate Advance until the end of the then applicable
LIBOR Interest Period therefor, at which time such LIBOR Rate Advance shall be
automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless the Borrower shall
have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice requesting
that, at the end of such LIBOR Interest Period, such LIBOR Rate Advance either
continue as a LIBOR Rate Advance for the same or another Interest Period or be
converted to an Advance of another Type. Subject to the terms of Section 2.5,
the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of an
Advance of any Type into any other Type or Types of Advances; provided that any
conversion of any LIBOR Rate Advance shall be made on, and only on, the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Borrower shall give the


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation Notice") of
each conversion of an Advance to a LIBOR Rate Advance or continuation of a LIBOR
Rate Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. (Cleveland time), at least three Business
Days, in the case of a conversion into or continuation of a LIBOR Rate Advance,
prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:

               (i) the requested date which shall be a Business Day, of such
          conversion or continuation;

               (ii) the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
          converted or continued; and

               (iii) the amount and Type(s) of Advance(s) into which such
          Advance is to be converted or continued and, in the case of a
          conversion into or continuation of a LIBOR Rate Advance, the duration
          of the LIBOR Interest Period applicable thereto.

     2.9 Changes in Interest Rate, Etc. Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a LIBOR Rate
Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.8 to but excluding
the date it becomes due or is converted into a LIBOR Rate Advance pursuant to
Section 2.8 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day.
Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a
Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the
Alternate Base Rate. Each LIBOR Rate Advance shall bear interest from and
including the first day of the LIBOR Interest Period applicable thereto to (but
not including) the last day of such LIBOR Interest Period at the interest rate
determined as applicable to such LIBOR Rate Advance.

     2.10 Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 2.7 or 2.8, during the continuance of a Default or
Unmatured Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the
Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders
notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the
Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no Advance may be converted
into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Advance. During the continuance of a Default
the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which
notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any
provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes
in interest rates), declare that the Default Rate shall apply, provided,
however, that the Default Rate shall become applicable automatically if a
Default occurs under Section 7.1 or 7.2, unless waived by the Required Lenders.

     2.11 Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be
made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds
to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's address specified
pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the
Administrative Agent specified in writing at least three (3) Business Days in
advance by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, by noon (Cleveland time) on
the date when due and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among
the Lenders. As provided elsewhere herein, all Lenders' interests in the
Advances and the Loan Documents shall be ratable undivided interests and none of
such Lenders' interests shall have priority over the others. Each payment
delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender or amount to
be applied or paid by the Administrative Agent to any Lender shall be paid
promptly (on the same day as received by the Administrative Agent if received


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

prior to noon (Cleveland time) on such day and otherwise on the next Business
Day) by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that
the Administrative Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article
XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the
Administrative Agent from such Lender. Payments received by the Administrative
Agent but not timely funded to the Lenders shall bear interest payable by the
Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date due until
the date paid. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge the
account of the Borrower maintained with KeyBank for each payment of principal,
interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

     2.12 Notes; Telephonic Notices. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record
the principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on the schedule
attached to its Note, provided, however, that the failure to so record shall not
affect the Borrower's obligations under such Note. The Borrower hereby
authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or
continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds
based on written notices made by any Authorized Officer and Borrower agrees to
deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent such written notice. The
Administrative Agent will at the request of the Borrower, from time to time, but
not more often than monthly, provide notice of the amount of the outstanding
Aggregate Commitment, the Type of Advance, and the applicable interest rate, if
for a LIBOR Rate Advance. Upon a Lender's furnishing to Borrower an affidavit to
such effect, if a Note is mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, Borrower shall
deliver to such Lender, in substitution therefore, a new note containing the
same terms and conditions as such Note being replaced.

     2.13 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued on
each Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first
such date to occur after the date hereof, at maturity, whether by acceleration
or otherwise. Interest shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis
of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but
not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior
to noon (Cleveland time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of
or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case
of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest in connection with such payment.

     2.14 Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments. The
Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Borrowing
Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it
hereunder not later than the close of business on the Business Day such notice
is received by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent will notify
each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each LIBOR Rate Advance promptly
upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice
of each change in the Alternate Base Rate

     2.15 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending
Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation
from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending
Installation and the Notes shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit
of such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written or telex notice at
least three (3) Business Days in advance to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through which Loans will be made by
it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.

     2.16 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Borrower
or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the

time at which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i)
in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the
Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The
Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on
demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount
so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during
the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the
Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (ii) in the case of payment by the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan. If such Lender so
repays such amount and interest thereon to the Administrative Agent within one
Business Day after such demand, all interest accruing on the Loan not funded by
such Lender during such period shall be payable to such Lender when received
from the Borrower.

     2.17 Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances. The Borrower shall
be permitted to replace any Lender which (a) is not capable of receiving
payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income
tax pursuant to Section 3.5, or (b) cannot maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans at a
suitable Lending Installation pursuant to Section 3.3, with a replacement bank
or other financial institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not
conflict with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements affecting the
Lenders, (ii) no Default or (after notice thereof to the Borrower) no Unmatured
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement,
(iii) the Borrower shall repay (or the replacement bank or institution shall
purchase, at par) all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender
prior to the date of replacement, (iv) the Borrower shall be liable to such
replaced Lender under Sections 3.4 and 3.6 if any LIBOR Rate Loan owing to such
replaced Lender shall be prepaid (or purchased) other than on the last day of
the Interest Period relating thereto, (v) the replacement bank or institution,
if not already a Lender, and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vi) the replaced Lender
shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of
Section 12.3 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
processing fee referred to therein), (vii) until such time as such replacement
shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any)
required pursuant to Section 3.5 and (viii) any such replacement shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any rights which the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

     2.18 Usury . This Agreement and each Note are subject to the express
condition that at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay
interest on the principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject any
Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of
the Maximum Legal Rate. If by the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents,
Borrower is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal
balance due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the
interest rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be
immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in
excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in
reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder. All
sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention
of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated
term of the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on
account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time
to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is
outstanding.

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
                             -----------------------

     3.1 Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

               (i) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to
          any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than
          with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its LIBOR
          Rate Loans, or

               (ii) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
          assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
          against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
          extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other
          than the Reserve Requirement and any other reserves and assessments
          taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to
          LIBOR Rate Advances), or

               (iii) imposes any other condition the direct result of which is
          to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending
          Installation of making, funding or maintaining its LIBOR Rate Loans,
          or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable
          Lending Installation in connection with its LIBOR Rate Loans, or
          requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any
          payment calculated by reference to the amount of LIBOR Rate Loans, by
          a material amount.

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation, as the case may be, of making or maintaining
its LIBOR Rate Loans or Commitment or to reduce the return received by such
Lender or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such LIBOR Rate
Loans or Commitment, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower
shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.

     3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender in good faith
determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling
such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as hereinafter defined), then,
within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the
amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the
portion of such increased capital which such Lender in good faith determines is
attributable to this Agreement, its outstanding credit exposure hereunder or its
obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's
policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the date
of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines (as hereinafter defined)
or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this
Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

     3.3 Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender in good faith
determines that maintenance of any of its LIBOR Rate Loans at a suitable Lending
Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive,
whether or not having the force of law, the Administrative Agent shall, with
written notice to Borrower, suspend the availability of the affected Type of
Advance and require any LIBOR Rate Advances of the affected Type to be repaid;
or if the Required Lenders in good faith determine that (i) deposits of a type
or maturity appropriate to match fund LIBOR Rate Advances are not available, the
Administrative Agent shall, with written notice to Borrower, suspend the
availability of the affected Type of Advance with respect to any LIBOR Rate
Advances made after the date of any such determination, or (ii) an interest rate
applicable to a Type of Advance does not accurately reflect the cost of making a
LIBOR Rate Advance of such Type, then, if for any reason whatsoever the
provisions of Section 3.1 are inapplicable, the Administrative Agent shall, with
written notice to Borrower, suspend the availability of the affected Type of
Advance with respect to any LIBOR Rate Advances made after the date of any such
determination. If the Borrower is required to so repay a LIBOR Rate Advance, the
Borrower may concurrently with such repayment borrow from the Lenders, in the
amount of such repayment, a Loan bearing interest at the Floating Rate.

     3.4 Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a ratable LIBOR Rate Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a ratable LIBOR
Rate Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason
other than default by the Lenders or as a result of unavailability pursuant to
Section 3.3, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost
incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or
cost (incurred or expected to be incurred) in liquidating or employing deposits
acquired to fund or maintain the ratable LIBOR Rate Advance and shall pay all
such losses or costs within fifteen (15) days after written demand therefor.

     3.5 Taxes.

               (i) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any
          Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall
          be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes.
          If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
          in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the
          Administrative Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as
          necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
          deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
          3.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
          receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
          deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (c)
          the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
          authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall
          furnish to the Administrative Agent the original copy of a receipt
          evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.


                                      -18-

               (ii) In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present
          or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
          taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
          hereunder or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or
          otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").

               (iii) The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Administrative
          Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
          (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on
          amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Administrative
          Agent or such Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest
          and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payments due
          under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date
          the Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant
          to Section 3.6.

               (iv) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
          United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender")
          agrees that it will, not more than ten Business Days after the
          Agreement Execution Date, (i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the
          Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States
          Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in either
          case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
          Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States
          federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of the Borrower and the
          Administrative Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9,
          as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption
          from United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender
          further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the
          Administrative Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form
          (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form expires
          or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event
          requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such
          additional forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested
          by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments
          described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is
          entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
          withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event
          (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation)
          has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
          otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or
          which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering
          any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises
          the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of
          receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
          States federal income tax.

               (v) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
          provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv),
          above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or
          regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration
          thereof by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the
          date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such
          Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
          Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States.

               (vi) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
          reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
          Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

          or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
          Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
          law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
          applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without
          withholding or at a reduced rate following receipt of such
          documentation.

               (vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other
          governmental authority of the United States or any other country or
          any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the
          Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid
          to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was
          not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to
          notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which
          rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other
          reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully
          for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative
          Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties
          and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
          amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this subsection,
          together with all costs and expenses related thereto (including
          attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative
          Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent).
          The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall
          survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this
          Agreement and any such Lender obligated to indemnify the
          Administrative Agent shall not be entitled to indemnification from the
          Borrower with respect to such amounts, whether pursuant to this
          Article or otherwise, except to the extent the Borrower participated
          in the actions giving rise to such liability.

     3.6 Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of LIBOR
Rate Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender
shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Sections 3.1, 3.2,
3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a LIBOR
Rate Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its LIBOR Rate Loan
through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the
deposit used as a reference in determining the LIBOR Rate applicable to such
Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein,
the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on
demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations
of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         ------------------------------

     GPLP and Owner each represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

     5.1 Existence. GPLP and Owner are each a limited partnership duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal
place of business in Columbus, Ohio and each is duly qualified as a foreign
limited partnership, properly licensed (if required), in good standing and has
all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which
its business is conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
and in good standing and to have the requisite authority would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     5.2 Authorization and Validity. Each of GPLP and Owner has the limited
partnership power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan
Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery
by GPLP and Owner of the Loan Documents and the performance of their respective
obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper limited partnership
proceedings, and the Loan Documents constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of each of them enforceable against them in accordance with their
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

     5.3 No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery by
GPLP and Owner of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate
any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award
binding on GPLP or Owner, or GPLP's or Owner's articles of incorporation,
operating agreements, partnership agreement, or by-laws, or the provisions of
any indenture, instrument or agreement to which GPLP or Owner is a party or is
subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder, except where such violation, conflict or
default would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of GPLP or Owner, pursuant to
the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent,
approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with, or exemption by, any governmental or public body or
authority, or any subdivision thereof, is required to authorize, or is required
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of, or the legality,
validity, binding effect or enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents other
than the filing of a copy of this Agreement.

     5.4 Financial Statements; Material Adverse Effect. All consolidated
financial statements of the Loan Parties heretofore or hereafter delivered to
the Lenders were prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect on the preparation
date of such statements and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition and operations of the Loan Parties at such date
and the consolidated results of their operations for the period then ended,
subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal and customary
year-end adjustments. From the preparation date of the most recent financial

Effect.

     5.5 Taxes. The Loan Parties have filed all United States federal tax
returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid
all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by
GPLP or Owner except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith
and as to which adequate reserves have been provided. No tax liens have been
filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to such taxes. The charges,
accruals and reserves on the books of GPLP and Owner in respect of any taxes or
other governmental charges are adequate.

     5.6 Litigation and Guarantee Obligations. Except as set forth on Schedule 2
hereto or as set forth in written notice to the Administrative Agent from time
to time, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation,
proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge of any of their officers,
threatened against or affecting the Loan Parties which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither GPLP nor Owner has any
material contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial
statements referred to in Section 6.1 or as set forth in written notices to the
Administrative Agent given from time to time after the Agreement Execution Date
on or about the date such material contingent obligations are incurred.

     5.7 Intentionally Omitted

applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic
or foreign government or any instrumentality or agency thereof, having
jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of

warranties is true and correct on and as of the Agreement Execution Date except

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES
                 ----------------------------------------------

     8.1 Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.7 or 7.8 occurs
with respect to GPLP or Owner, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, so long as a
Default exists Lenders shall have no obligation to make any Loans and the
Required Lenders, at any time prior to the date that such Default has been fully
cured, may permanently terminate the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder and declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon
if the Required Lenders elected to accelerate (i) the Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives and (ii) if any
automatic or optional acceleration has occurred, the Administrative Agent, as
directed by the Required Lenders (or if no such direction is given within 30
days after a request for direction, as the Administrative Agent deems in the
best interests of the Lenders, in its sole discretion), shall use its good faith
efforts to collect, including without limitation, by filing and diligently
pursuing judicial action, all amounts owed by the Borrower and any Guarantor
under the Loan Documents.

     If, within 10 days after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or
termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder as a
result of any Default (other than any Default as described in Section 7.7 or 7.8
with respect to GPLP or Owner) and before any judgment or decree for the payment
of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, all of the Lenders
(in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by
notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.

     8.2 Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII the Required
Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any
Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement or
waiver shall, without the consent of all Lenders:

               (i) Extend the Facility Termination Date, or forgive all or any
          portion of the principal amount of any Loan or accrued interest
          thereon, reduce the Applicable Margins (or modify any definition
          herein which would have the effect of reducing the Applicable Margins)
          or the underlying interest rate options or extend the time of payment
          of any such principal, interest or facility fees.

               (ii) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
          Required Lenders.

               (iii) Increase the Aggregate Commitment beyond $30,000,000.

               (iv) Permit the Borrower to assign its rights under this
          Agreement.

               (v) Amend Sections 8.1, 8.2 , or 8.4.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Administrative
Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Administrative
Agent.


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

     8.3 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or
the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan
shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise
of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the
terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid
unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and
then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies
contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all
shall be available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the
Obligations have been paid in full.

     8.4 Foreclosure. The Lenders hereby agree to the following in the event of
foreclosure under the Mortgage or any other attempt at realization of the
security thereunder:

          (a) To subscribe to and accept its Percentage of the ownership
     interests in any entity organized to hold title to the Collateral Asset and
     that the nature of such entity shall be determined by the Required Lenders,
     subject to each Lender's right to hold its interests in such entity in, and
     assign such interests to, any affiliate of such Lender or any other entity
     required by laws or regulations governing such Lender. The Administrative
     Agent is hereby authorized to act for and on behalf of the Lenders in all
     day-to-day matters with respect to the exercise of rights described herein
     such as the supervision of attorneys, accountants, appraisers or others
     acting for the benefit of all of the Lenders in connection with litigation,
     foreclosure or realization of all or any security given as Collateral for
     the Obligations or other similar actions.

          (b) If the Lenders acquire the Collateral Asset either by foreclosure
     or deed in lieu of foreclosure, to negotiate in good faith to reach
     agreement in writing relating to the ownership, operation, maintenance,
     marketing and sale of Collateral Asset and that such agreement shall be
     consistent with the following:

               (i) The Collateral Asset will not be held as a long-term
          investment but will be marketed in an attempt to sell them in a time
          period consistent with the regulations applicable to national banks
          for owning real estate. Current appraisals of the Collateral Asset
          shall be obtained by the Administrative Agent from time to time during
          the ownership period at Lenders' expense (without diminishing or
          releasing any obligation of the Borrower to pay for such costs) and an
          appraised value shall be established and updated from time to time
          based on such appraisals.

               (ii) Certain decision making with respect to the day-to-day
          operations of the Collateral Asset will be delegated to management and
          leasing agents. All agreements with such management and leasing agents
          will be subject to the approval of the Required Lenders. The
          day-to-day supervision of such agents shall be done by the
          Administrative Agent.

               (iii) Except as provided in the following sentences, all
          decisions as to whether to sell the Collateral Asset shall be subject
          to the approval of all the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
          Lenders agree that if the Administrative Agent receives a bona fide
          "all cash" offer from an entity not affiliated with the Borrower or
          any Lender for the purchase of any of the Collateral Asset and such
          offer equals or exceeds ninety percent (90%) of the most recent


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

          Appraised Value of such Collateral Asset as established by an
          Appraisal prepared in accordance with the standards established in
          this Agreement that has been completed within six months of such
          offer, then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice of such
          offer to the Lenders and request their approval for sale at such a
          price. If the Required Lenders approve of such a sale (or are deemed
          to approve of such a sale) then the Administrative Agent, acting on
          behalf of the Lenders, is irrevocably authorized to accept such offer.

               (iv) All expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and
          Lenders in connection with the ownership, operation, maintenance,
          marketing and sale of the Collateral Asset shall be allocated among
          the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Percentages.

               (v) All expenditures and other actions taken with respect to the
          Collateral Asset shall at all times be subject to the regulations and
          requirements pertaining to national banks applicable thereto. Without
          limiting the generality of the foregoing, all necessary approvals from
          regulatory authorities in connection with any expenditure of funds by
          the Lenders shall be a condition to such expenditure.

     8.5 Insolvency of Borrower. In the event of the insolvency of GPLP or
Owner, the Lenders shall have no obligation to make further disbursements of the
Facility, and the outstanding principal balance of the Facility, including
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be immediately due and payable.

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Administrative Agent shall
have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be
furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at such time, but is
voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (either in its
capacity as Administrative Agent or in its individual capacity).

     10.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder
and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed
by the required percentage of the Lenders needed to take such action or refrain
from taking such action, and such instructions and any action taken or failure
to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders
hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to take
any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in
writing to do so by the Required Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under
any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction
by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it
may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

telegram, statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect
to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative
Agent, which counsel may be employees of the Administrative Agent.

     10.8 Administrative Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders
agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in proportion
to their respective Commitments (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the
Borrower for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the
Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan
Documents, if not paid by Borrower and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to
or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in
connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including without
limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative
Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement
of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct or a breach of the Administrative
Agent's express obligations and undertakings to the Lenders. The obligations of
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under this Section 10.8 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     10.9 Rights as a Lender. In the event the Administrative Agent is a Lender,
the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and
under any other Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though
it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
at any time when the Administrative Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such
Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

     10.10 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     10.11 Successor Administrative Agent. Except as otherwise provided below,
KeyBank National Association shall at all times serve as the Administrative
Agent during the term of this Facility. The Administrative Agent may resign at
any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such
resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Administrative
Agent. If the Administrative Agent has been grossly negligent in the performance
of its obligations hereunder, the Administrative Agent may be removed at any
time by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from all other
Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the other
Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall
appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative
Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Administrative Agent's
giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Administrative
Agent shall appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor
Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Administrative


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint
any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Administrative
Agent hereunder. No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be
appointed hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the
appointment. Any such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $500,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the resigning or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

     10.12 Notice of Defaults. If a Lender becomes aware of a Default or
Unmatured Default, such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
fact provided that the failure to give such notice shall not create liability on
the part of a Lender. Upon receipt of such notice that a Default or Unmatured
Default has occurred, the Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Lenders
of such fact.

     10.13 Requests for Approval. If the Administrative Agent requests in
writing the consent or approval of a Lender, such Lender shall respond and
either approve or disapprove definitively in writing to the Administrative Agent
within ten (10) Business Days (or sooner if such notice specifies a shorter
period for responses based on Administrative Agent's good faith determination
that circumstances exist warranting its request for an earlier response) after
such written request from the Administrative Agent. If the Lender does not so
respond, that Lender shall be deemed to have approved the request.

     10.14 Defaulting Lenders. At such time as a Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, such Defaulting Lender's right to vote on matters which are subject to
the consent or approval of the Required Lenders, each affected Lender or all
Lenders shall be immediately suspended until such time as the Lender is no
longer a Defaulting Lender, except that the amount of the Commitment of the
Defaulting Lender may not be changed without its consent. If a Defaulting Lender
has failed to fund its pro rata share of any Advance and until such time as such
Defaulting Lender subsequently funds its pro rata share of such Advance, all
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be subordinated in
right of payment, as provided in the following sentence, to the prior payment in
full of all principal of, interest on and fees relating to the Loans funded by
the other Lenders in connection with any such Advance in which the Defaulting
Lender has not funded its pro rata share (such principal, interest and fees
being referred to as "Senior Loans" for the purposes of this section). All
amounts paid by the Borrower, the Parent Entities or the Guarantors and
otherwise due to be applied to the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to
the other Lenders in accordance with their respective pro rata shares
(recalculated for the purposes hereof to exclude the Defaulting Lender) until
all Senior Loans have been paid in full provided, however, in no event will any
such distribution to the other Lenders give rise to any liability of the
Borrower to the Defaulting Lender. After the Senior Loans have been paid in full
equitable adjustments will be made in connection with future payments by the
Borrower to the extent a portion of the Senior Loans had been repaid with
amounts that otherwise would have been distributed to a Defaulting Lender but
for the operation of this Section 10.14. This provision governs only the
relationship among the Administrative Agent, each Defaulting Lender and the
other Lenders; nothing hereunder shall limit the obligation of the Borrower to


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

repay all Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The provisions
of this section shall apply and be effective regardless of whether a Default
occurs and is continuing, and notwithstanding (i) any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, (ii) any instruction of the Borrower as to its
desired application of payments or (iii) the suspension of such Defaulting
Lender's right to vote on matters which are subject to the consent or approval
of the Required Lenders or all Lenders.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                     RELEASE OF PORTION OF COLLATERAL ASSET
                     --------------------------------------

     11.1 Transfer. Provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and remain
uncured and provided Borrower desires to transfer the Expansion Parcel for
commercial purposes compatible with the use and operation of the Property as a
regional shopping center, Borrower shall have the right from time to time prior
to the Facility Termination Date to obtain a release of the lien of the Mortgage
(and related Loan Documents) as to the Expansion Parcel and to modify the Ground
Lease (as such term is defined in the Mortgage) or assign a portion thereof so
as to exclude the Expansion Parcel from the premises demised thereby upon
satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

               (i) Borrower shall provide Administrative Agent not less than
          thirty (30) days notice (or a shorter period of time if permitted by
          Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) specifying the date (the
          "Expansion Date") on which the partial release is to occur provided,
          however, that Borrower may postpone the Expansion Date from time to
          time as long as the extended date is at least ten (10) Business Days
          after notice of such extension;

               (ii) Borrower shall have delivered to Administrative Agent
          evidence that Borrower has complied with all requirements of and
          obtained all approvals required under any leases of the Collateral
          Asset and any operating agreements applicable to the release of the
          Expansion Parcel and that the partial release does not violate any of
          the provisions of such leases and operating agreements including,
          without limitation, provisions relating to the availability of parking
          at the Collateral Asset provided, however, that an Authorized
          Officer's certificate to that effect shall be sufficient evidence of
          such compliance and obtaining of such approvals as to tenants which
          are not Major Tenants;

               (iii) Borrower shall have delivered to Lender (A) at Borrower's
          option, (x) an endorsement to the Lenders' title insurance policy, (y)
          an opinion of counsel (from counsel reasonably to Administrative
          Agent) or (z) a certificate of an architect (from an architect
          reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and licensed to practice
          in Kansas) indicating that the Expansion Parcel has been legally
          subdivided for zoning lot purposes from the remainder of the
          Collateral Asset pursuant to a zoning lot subdivision in accordance
          with applicable law, (B) at Borrower's option (x) an endorsement to
          the Lenders' title insurance policy, (y) an opinion of counsel (from
          counsel reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent) or (z) a

<PAGE>

          that the balance of the Collateral Asset separately conforms to and is
          in material compliance with all applicable legal requirements and
          constitutes one or more separate tax lots, (C) a certificate from an
          architect or engineer licensed to practice in Kansas and reasonably
          acceptable to Administrative Agent to the effect that the Expansion
          Parcel is not necessary for the uses of the remainder of the
          Collateral Asset, including, without limitation, for support, access,
          driveways, parking, utilities, drainage flows or any other purpose,
          (after giving effect to any easements therefor reserved over the
          Expansion Parcel for the benefit of the remainder of the Collateral
          Asset) and (D) an Authorized Officer's certificate with supporting
          documentation indicating that either (y) sufficient parking remains on
          the remainder of the Collateral Asset to comply with all leases of
          such remainder and with all operating agreements and which is adequate
          for the proper use and enjoyment of the balance of the Collateral
          Asset; or (z) reservations of parking spaces (in favor of such
          remainder) in the Expansion Parcel are sufficient (when added to
          parking otherwise available to the remainder) to comply with all
          leases of such remainder and with all operating agreements and which
          are adequate for the proper use and enjoyment of the remainder of the
          Collateral Asset;

               (iv) Borrower shall have delivered a metes and bounds description
          of the Expansion Parcel and a survey of the Expansion Parcel and the
          remainder of the Property which would be standard in commercial
          lending transactions;

               (v) Borrower shall have delivered to Administrative Agent on the
          date of the release an endorsement to the policy or policies of title
          insurance insuring the Mortgage reflecting the release and (A)
          insuring Lenders' interest in any easements created in connection with
          the release, (B) extending the effective date of the policy or
          policies to the effective date of the release, and (C) confirming no
          change in the priority of the Mortgage on the remainder of the
          Collateral Asset or in the amount of the insurance or the coverage
          under the policy or policies; and

               (vi) Borrower shall pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
          Administrative Agent incurred in connection with the partial release,
          including its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.

     11.2 Release. If Borrower has elected to release the Expansion Parcel and
the requirements of this Article 11 have been satisfied, the Expansion Parcel
shall be released from the Lien of the Mortgage (and related Loan Documents) and
the Ground Lease modification or partial assignment may be executed. In
connection with the release of the Lien, Borrower shall submit to Administrative
Agent, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Expansion Date (or such
shorter time as is acceptable to Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), a
release of Lien (and related Loan Documents) for execution by Administrative
Agent. Such release and consent and subordination shall be in a form appropriate
in the jurisdiction in which the Collateral Asset is located and shall contain
standard provisions protecting the rights of a releasing lender. In addition,
Borrower shall provide all other documentation Administrative Agent reasonably
requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such release, together
with an Authorized Officer's certificate certifying that such documentation (i)
is in compliance with all legal requirements, and (ii) will effect such release
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrower shall pay all costs,
taxes and expenses associated with the release of the Lien of the Mortgage,
including Administrative Agent's reasonable attorneys' fees. Borrower shall
cause leasehold title to the Expansion Parcel so released from the Lien of the
Mortgage to be transferred to and held by a Person other than Borrower.

     11.3 Subdivision Alternative. If Borrower is unable to legally subdivide
the Expansion Parcel from the remainder of the Collateral Asset, or if Borrower
desires to enter into a ground sublease in lieu of conveying leasehold title to


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

the Expansion Parcel, Borrower shall have the right to sublease the Expansion
Parcel to a Person other than Borrower in lieu of such conveyance and
Administrative Agent shall subordinate the Lien of the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents to such sublease, provided (A) Borrower complies with all of the
conditions to release set forth in this Article 11 other than the requirements
that such Expansion Parcel be legally subdivided from the remainder of the
Collateral Asset, (B) the request for such ground sublease shall be accompanied
by, at Borrower's option, (1) an endorsement to the title insurance policy, (2)
an opinion of counsel (from counsel reasonably acceptable to Administrative
Agent) or (3) an architect's or surveyor's certificate from an architect or
surveyor reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and licensed in Kansas,
stating that a subdivision is not required in order for the remainder of the
Collateral Asset to comply with the legal requirements after the commencement of
the ground sublease, (C) Borrower delivers evidence to Administrative Agent
indicating that either (1) financing is available from a reliable funding source
to fund the cost of the improvements to be constructed on the Expansion Parcel
or (2) the tenant has sufficient financial wherewithal to pay for the cost of
construction of such improvements, (D) such ground sublease shall contain the
following provisions: (1) the Expansion Parcel shall not be used for any purpose
other than that which is compatible with the regional shopping center at the
Collateral Asset, (2) the ground sublease shall require that the tenant be
responsible for construction of improvements (however, Borrower, as the landlord
thereunder, may be responsible for construction of the improvements provided
that Borrower complies with the applicable provisions of the Mortgage), all
allocable taxes and all insurance, maintenance, utility, repair and other
similar obligations with respect to the tenant's improvements, (3) the tenant
shall be required to restore the demised premises in the case of casualty and
condemnation to a safe and habitable condition and/or to remove any damaged
structures or debris therefrom so as to leave the demised premises in a safe
condition, and (4) the tenant shall discharge (unless the same have been bonded
or otherwise secured to Administrative Agent's satisfaction) within thirty (30)
days any mechanic's lien filed against the demised premises by reason of the
acts of the tenant or Persons claiming by, through or under the tenant. Such
ground sublease may permit the tenant to procure mortgage financing secured by
the leasehold estate created thereby and such ground lease will contain no
provisions which are inconsistent with Borrower's obligations under the Loan
Documents or which would be unacceptable to a prudent lender subordinating its
mortgage to same (including any provisions which are materially detrimental to
the interests of such lender).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS
                -------------------------------------------------

     12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Lenders
and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrower shall
not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents
and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section
12.3. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section
12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit assignments
creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or
assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender
which is a fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations
to its trustee; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment creating a
security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations
hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions
of Section 12.3. The Administrative Agent and Borrower may treat the Person
which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent and Borrower may in its
discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person
which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such
Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any
Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and
provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any
Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been
issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent
holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

     12.2 Participations.

          12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
     course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time
     sell to one or more banks, financial institutions, pension funds, or any
     other funds or entities ("Participants") participating interests in any
     Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of
     such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.
     In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
     Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
     remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
     parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall
     remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes under the Loan
     Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall
     be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests,
     and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely
     and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
     obligations under the Loan Documents.

          12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
     approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
     modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than
     any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or
     Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require
     consent of all the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of any
     other Loan Document.

     12.3 Assignments.

          12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course
     of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign
     to any of such Lender's affiliates or to one or more banks, financial
     institutions or pension funds, or with the prior approval of the Borrower,
     which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, any other entity
     ("Purchasers") all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the
     Loan Documents provided that any assignment of only a portion of such
     rights and obligations shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000. In
     addition, KeyBank National Association agrees that it will not assign any
     portion of its Commitment or Commitments of its affiliates, if such
     assignment will result in the amount of the Commitment to be held by
     KeyBank National Association and its affiliates to be less than the next
     highest Commitment amount held by any other Lender provided that no Default
     has occurred and is continuing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no approval
     of the Borrower shall be required for any such assignment if a Default has
     occurred and is then continuing. Such assignment shall be substantially in
     the form of Exhibit D hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by
     the parties thereto. The consent of the Administrative Agent shall be


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

     required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a
     Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof. Such consent shall
     not be unreasonably withheld.

          12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative
     Agent and Borrower of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form
     attached as Exhibit "I" to Exhibit D hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"),
     together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of
     a $3,500 fee by the assignor or assignee to the Administrative Agent for
     processing such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the
     effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of
     Assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect
     that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment
     and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets" as
     defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in
     and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and
     after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all
     purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document
     executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a
     Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an
     original party hereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrower,
     the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release the
     transferor Lender, and the transferor Lender shall automatically be
     released on the effective date of such assignment, with respect to the
     percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such
     Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant
     to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and
     the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes
     are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate,
     replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal
     amounts reflecting their Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to such
     assignment.

     12.4 Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, subject to
Section 9.11 of this Agreement.

"Assignee") is dated as of _____________, 200_. The parties hereto agree as
follows:

     1. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. The Assignor is a party to a Term Loan Agreement
(which, as it may be amended, modified, renewed or extended from time to time is

hereto ("Schedule 1"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit Agreement.

     2. ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION. The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the
Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the Assignor, an

specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1 of all outstanding rights and obligations
under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Commitment
purchased by the Assignee hereunder is set forth in Item 4 of Schedule 1.

     3. EFFECTIVE DATE. The effective date of this Assignment Agreement (the
"Effective Date") shall be the later of the date specified in Item 5 of Schedule

Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, (i) the Assignee shall have the rights
and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to the rights
and obligations assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall
relinquish its rights and be released from its corresponding obligations under

assigned hereby. In consideration for the sale and assignment of Loans
hereunder, the Assignee shall pay the Assignor, on the Effective Date, an amount
equal to the principal amount of the portion of all Loans assigned to the
Assignee hereunder which is outstanding on the Effective Date. The Assignee will
promptly remit to the Assignor (i) the portion of any principal payments
assigned hereunder and received from the Agent and (ii) any amounts of interest
on Loans and fees received from the Agent to the extent either (i) or (ii)
relate to the portion of the Loans assigned to the Assignee hereunder for
periods prior to the Effective Date and have not been previously paid by the
Assignee to the Assignor. In the event that either party hereto receives any
payment to which the other party hereto is entitled under this Assignment
Agreement, then the party receiving such amount shall promptly remit it to the
other party hereto.

writ, judgment, injunction or decree and that any consent required under the
terms of the Loan Documents has been obtained and (ii) unless the prior written
consent of the Assignor is obtained, the Assignee is not thereby released from
its obligations to the Assignor hereunder, if any remain unsatisfied, including,

Commitment occurs between the date of this Assignment Agreement and the

remain the same, but the dollar amount purchased shall be recalculated based on
the reduced Aggregate Commitment.

     10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Assignment Agreement and the attached Notice of
Assignment embody the entire agreement and understanding between the parties
hereto and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the parties
hereto relating to the subject matter hereof.

     Phase I Environmental Site Assessments to be prepared in accordance with
the ASTM Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment Process (ASTM Designation E1527-94), a summary of
which follows:

     This ASTM practice is generally considered the industry standard for
     conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA). The purpose of
     this standard is to "define good commercial and customary practice in the
     United States of America for conducting an ESA of a parcel of commercial
     real estate with respect to the range of contaminants within the scope of
     the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
     (CERCLA) and petroleum products." The ASTM Phase I ESA is intended to
     permit a user to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the
     innocent landowner defense to CERCLA liability; that is, the practice that
     constitutes "all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses
     of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practices" as
     defined in 42 USC 9601(35)(B).

     The goal of the ASTM Phase I ESA is to identify "recognized environmental
     conditions." Recognized environmental conditions means the presence or
     likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products on a
     property under conditions that indicate an existing release, a past
     release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substances or
     petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground,
     groundwater, or surface water of the property. The term includes hazardous
     substances or petroleum products even under conditions in compliance with
     laws. The term is not intended to include de minimus conditions that
     generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to
     the attention of appropriate governmental agencies.

     The ASTM standard indicates that a Phase I ESA should consist of four main
     components: 1) Records Review; 2) Site Reconnaissance; 3) Interviews; and
     4) Report. The purpose of the records review is to obtain and review
     records that will help identify recognized environmental conditions in
     connection with the property. The site reconnaissance involves physical
     observation of the property's exterior and interior, as well as an
     observation of adjoining properties. Interviews with previous and current
     owners and occupants, and local government officials provides insight into
     the presence or absence of recognized environmental conditions in
     connection with the property. The final component of the ESA, the report,
     contains the findings of the ESA and conclusions regarding the presence or
     absence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the
     property. It includes documentation to support the analysis, opinions, and
     conclusions found in the report.

     While the use of this practice is intended to constitute appropriate
     inquiry for purposes of CERCLA's innocent landowner defense, it is not
     intended that its use be limited to that purpose. The ASTM standard is
     intended to be an approach to conducting an inquiry designed to identify
     recognized environmental conditions in connection with a property, and
     environmental site assessments.

KeyBank,
as Administrative Agent for the Lenders
127 Public Square, 8th Floor
Cleveland, Ohio

     Re:  $30,000,000 Term Loan to Glimcher Properties Limited Partnership and
          GM Olathe, LLC (collectively, the "Borrower")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     We have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with a $30,000,000
secured term loan , (the "Loan"), which Loan is being made pursuant to that
certain Term Loan Agreement dated as of January __, 2006 (the "Loan Agreement")
between Borrower, KeyBank and the several lenders from time to time parties
thereto (collectively, the "Lenders"), and KeyBank, as Administrative Agent (the
"Agent").

     In connection with the Loan we have been furnished with originals or copies
certified to our satisfaction of the partnership agreements and certificates of
limited partnership, and Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the general
partners of the entities comprising the Borrower (as defined in the Loan
Agreement), and all such corporate and other records of the Borrower and the
Parent Entities, with such declarations and agreements, and certificates of
officers and representatives of the Borrower, with such other documents, and we
have made such other examinations and investigations as we have deemed necessary
as a basis for the opinions expressed below.

     We have examined the originals of the following documents, each of which is
addressed to the Lender or to which the Lender is a party (all of which are
sometimes collectively referred to as the "Loan Documents"):

     1.   The Loan Agreement; and

     2.   [describe promissory notes and other Loan Documents].

     Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

     1.   The entities comprising the Borrower include a limited liability
          company and a limited partnership, both duly formed, validly existing
          and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Borrower
          has all requisite power and authority to own its properties, carry on
          its business and to deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan
          Documents.

     2.   Each of the general partners of Borrower is a corporation or trust
          duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
          of the State of Delaware. Each of the general partners of Borrower has
          all requisite power and authority to own its properties, carry on its
          business and to deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan
          Documents.


                                       F-1
<PAGE>

     3.   The execution, delivery, and performance by each of the entities
          comprising the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party
          has been duly authorized by all necessary action of the Borrower and
          does not (i) require any consent or approval of any partner or
          shareholder of such entity or any other person or entity excepting
          such consents or approvals as have actually been obtained; (ii)
          violate any provision of any law, rule, or regulation of the United
          States or the State of Ohio, or any provision of the partnership or
          corporate law presently in effect having applicability to the Borrower
          or its general partners, as applicable; (iii) violate any provision of
          the partnership agreements of the Borrower or the articles of
          incorporation or bylaws of its general partners; (iv) violate any
          presently existing statutory or administrative provision or judicial
          decision applicable to the Borrower or its general partners; or (v)
          result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or
          instrument affecting the Borrowers or its general partners.

     4.   Each Loan Document to which it is a party (a) has been properly
          authorized, executed and delivered by each of the entities comprising
          the Borrower, (b) constitutes the legal, valid, and binding
          obligations of the Borrower, and (c) is enforceable in accordance with
          its terms, except that we express no opinion regarding the
          enforceability of the Mortgage under Kansas law.

     5.   To our knowledge, no presently existing authorization, exemption,
          consent, approval, license, or registration with any court or
          governmental department, commission, bureau, agency, or
          instrumentality will be necessary for the valid, binding, and
          enforceable execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the
          Loan Documents.

     6.   To our knowledge, there are no actions, suits, or proceedings pending
          or threatened against the Borrower before any court or governmental
          entity or instrumentality which could reasonably be expected to have a
          Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Loan Agreement).

     7.   The Loan Documents (other than the Mortgage) are governed by the laws
          of the State of Ohio, and the Loan, including the interest rate
          reserved in the applicable Note and all fees and charges paid or to be
          paid by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with such Loan pursuant
          to the applicable Loan Documents, is not in violation of the usury
          laws of the State of Ohio.

     The opinions expressed herein are expressly made subject to and qualified
by the following:

     (a) We have assumed that the Loan Documents are duly authorized and validly
executed and delivered by the Agent, the Lenders and all other parties other
than the Borrower.

     (b) This opinion is based upon existing laws, ordinances and regulations in
effect as of the date hereof.

     (c) This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Ohio and applicable
federal law and no opinion is expressed as to the laws of any other

Property to any party, except as contained herein and in the Loan Documents.

     Each Indemnitor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Administrative
Agent free and harmless from and against all loss, cost, damage and expense,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, which the Administrative Agent
may sustain by reason of the inaccuracy or breach of any of the foregoing
representations and warranties as of the date the foregoing representations and
warranties are made and are deemed remade; provided, however, that nothing
hereunder shall constitute or be deemed to constitute any indemnity of
Administrative Agent for loss, costs, damages, etc. caused by such
Administrative Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     3. Covenants. Indemnitors shall

     a. comply, and use best efforts to cause all other persons on or occupying
the Property to comply, with all Environmental Laws;

     b. not install, use, generate, manufacture, store, treat, release or
dispose of, nor permit the installation, use, generation, storage, treatment,
release or disposal of, Materials of Environmental Concern on, under or about
the Property except Materials of Environmental Concern used in the operation of
the Property and held as inventory for sale by Tenants in customary amounts and
in compliance with Environmental Laws;

     c. immediately advise Administrative Agent in writing of:

          (i) any and all Environmental Proceedings;


                                      I-2
<PAGE>

          (ii) the presence of any Materials of Environmental Concern on, under
     or about the Property of which Administrative Agent has not previously been
     advised in writing except Materials of Environmental Concern used in the
     operation of the Property and held as inventory for sale by Tenants in
     customary amounts and in compliance with Environmental laws;

          (iii) any remedial action taken by, or on behalf of, any Indemnitor in
     response to any Materials of Environmental Concern on, under or about the
     Property or to any Environmental Proceedings of which Administrative Agent
     has not previously been advised in writing;

          (iv) the discovery by any Indemnitor of the presence of any Materials
     of Environmental Concern on, under or about any real property or bodies of
     water adjoining or in the vicinity of the Property that are likely to have
     Material Adverse Effect; and

          (v) the discovery by any Indemnitor of any occurrence or condition on
     any real property adjoining or in the vicinity of the Property that could
     cause the Property or any part thereof to be subject to any restrictions on
     the ownership, occupancy, transferability or use of the Property under any
     Environmental Laws;

     d. provide Administrative Agent with copies of all reports, analyses,
notices, licenses, approvals, orders, correspondences or other written materials
in its possession or control relating to the environmental condition of the
Property or real property or bodies of water adjoining or in the vicinity of the
Property or environmental proceedings immediately upon receipt, completion or
delivery of such materials;

     e. not install or allow to be installed any tanks on, at or under the
Property;

     f. not create or permit to continue in existence any lien (whether or not
such lien has priority over the lien created by the Mortgage) upon the Property
imposed pursuant to any Laws relating to Materials of Environmental Concern; and

     g. not change or alter the present use of the Property unless Indemnitors
shall have notified Administrative Agent thereof in writing and Administrative
Agent shall have determined, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such
change or modification will not result in the presence of Materials of
Environmental Concern on the Property in question in such a level that would
increase the potential liability for Environmental Proceedings.

     4. Right of Entry and Disclosure of Environmental Reports. Borrower hereby
grants to Administrative Agent its agents, employees, consultants and
contractors, an irrevocable license and authorization to enter upon and inspect
the Property at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, and,
subject to the rights of tenants, conduct such environmental audits and tests,
including, without limitation, subsurface testing, soils and groundwater
testing, and other tests which may physically invade the Property.
Administrative Agent shall consult with Borrower in advance of such tests.
Administrative Agent agrees, however, that it shall not conduct any such audits,
unless an Event of Default exists under the Loan Documents or Administrative
Agent has reason to believe that such audit may disclose the presence or release
of Materials of Environmental Concern other than materials used in the operation
of the Property or held as inventory for sale by Tenants in customary amounts
and in compliance with Environmental Laws, or unless an environmental audit


                                      I-3
<PAGE>

deems further testing necessary. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Borrower agrees that Administrative Agent shall have the right to
appoint a receiver to enforce this right to enter and inspect the Property to
the extent such authority is provided under applicable law. All reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
with any inspection, audit or testing conducted in accordance with this Section
4 shall be paid by Borrower. The results of all investigations and reports
prepared by Administrative Agent shall be and at all times remain the property
of Administrative Agent and under no circumstances shall Administrative Agent
have any obligation whatsoever to disclose or otherwise make available to
Indemnitors or any other party such results or any other information obtained by
it in connection with such investigations and reports; provided, however, that
if requested by Borrower, Administrative Agent shall provide to Borrower a copy
of the written report with respect to any inspection, audit or testing for which
Borrower has paid hereunder. If Administrative Agent becomes the owner of the
Property, Administrative Agent may, and Indemnitors hereby expressly authorize
Administrative Agent to make available to any party in connection with a sale of
the Property any and all reports, whether prepared by Administrative Agent or
prepared by Borrower and provided to Administrative Agent (collectively, the
"Environmental Reports") which Administrative Agent may have with respect to the
Property. Borrower consents to Administrative Agent notifying any party under
such circumstances of the availability of any or all of the Environmental
Reports and the information contained therein. Each Indemnitor further agrees
that Administrative Agent may disclose such Environmental Reports to any
governmental agency or authority if they reasonably believe, upon advice of
counsel that they are required to disclose any matter contained therein to such
agency or authority; provided that Administrative Agent shall give Borrower at
least 48 hours prior written notice before so doing. Each Indemnitor
acknowledges that Administrative Agent cannot control or otherwise assure the
truthfulness or accuracy of the Environmental Reports, and that the release of
the Environmental Reports, or any information contained therein, to prospective
bidders at any foreclosure sale of the Property may have a material and adverse
effect upon the amount which a party may bid at such sale. Each Indemnitor
agrees that Administrative Agent shall not have any liability whatsoever as a
result of delivering any or all of the Environmental Reports or any information
contained therein to any third party, and each Indemnitor hereby releases and
forever discharges Administrative Agent from any and all claims, damages, or
causes of action arising out of connected with or incidental to the
Environmental Reports or the delivery thereof.

     5. Indemnitor's Remedial Work. Indemnitors shall promptly perform or cause
to be performed any and all necessary remedial work ("Remedial Work") in
response to any Environmental Proceedings or the presence, storage, use,
disposal, transportation, discharge or release of any Materials of Environmental
Concern on, under or about any of the Property; provided, however, that Borrower
shall perform or cause to be performed such Remedial Work so as to minimize any
impairment to Lenders' security under the Loan Documents.

     All Remedial Work shall be conducted:

     a. in a diligent and timely fashion by licensed contractors acting under
the supervision of a consulting environmental engineer;

     b. pursuant to a detailed written plan for the Remedial Work approved by
any public or private agencies or persons with a legal or contractual right to
such approval;


                                      I-4
<PAGE>

     c. with such insurance coverage pertaining to liabilities arising out of
the Remedial Work as is then customarily maintained with respect to such
activities; and

     d. only following receipt of any required permits, licenses or approvals.

     The selection of the Remedial Work contractors and consulting environmental
engineer, the contracts entered into with such parties, any disclosures to or
agreements with any public or private agencies or parties relating to Remedial
Work and the written plan for the Remedial Work (and any changes thereto) shall
each be subject to Administrative Agent's prior written approval, which shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. In addition, Indemnitors
shall submit to Administrative Agent, promptly upon receipt or preparation,
copies of any and all reports, studies, analyses, correspondence, governmental
comments or approvals, proposed removal or other Remedial Work contracts and
similar information prepared or received by Indemnitors in connection with any
Remedial Work, or Materials of Environmental Concern relating to the Property.
All costs and expenses of such Remedial Work shall be paid by Indemnitors,
including, without limitation, the charges of the Remedial Work contractors and
the consulting environmental engineer, any taxes or penalties assessed in
connection with the Remedial Work and Administrative Agent's reasonable expenses
and out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with monitoring or review of such
Remedial Work. Lenders shall have the right but not the obligation to join and
participate in, as a party if it so elects, any legal proceedings or actions
initiated in connection with any Environmental Proceedings.

     6. Indemnity. Indemnitors shall protect, indemnify, defend and hold the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any successors to Lenders' interest in the
Property, and any other Person who acquires any portion of the Property at a
foreclosure sale or otherwise through the exercise of Lenders' rights and
remedies under the Loan Documents, and all directors, officers, employees and
agents of all of the aforementioned indemnified parties, harmless from and
against any and all actual or potential claims, liabilities, damages (direct or
indirect), losses, fines, penalties, judgments, awards, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and
expenses of investigation) (collectively, "Expenses") which arise out of or
relate in any way to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained herein, or any Environmental Proceedings or any use, handling,
production, transportation, disposal, release or storage of any Materials of
Environmental Concern in, under or on the Property, whether by any Indemnitor or
any other person, including, without limitation:

     a. all foreseeable and all unforeseeable Expenses arising out of:

          (i) Environmental proceedings or the use, generation, storage,
     discharge or disposal of Materials of Environmental Concern by Indemnitors,
     any prior owner or operator of the Property or any person on or about the
     Property, unless caused by the willful misconduct, gross negligence, or bad
     faith of the Lenders or Administrative Agent;

          (ii) any residual contamination affecting any natural resource or the
     environment; or

          (iii) any exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any of
     their rights and remedies hereunder unless caused by the willful
     misconduct, gross negligence, or bad faith of the Lenders or Administrative
     Agent; and


                                      I-5
<PAGE>

     b. the costs of any required or necessary investigation, assessment,
testing, remediation, repair, cleanup, or detoxification of the Property and the
preparation of any closure or other required plans.

     Indemnitors' liability to the aforementioned indemnified parties shall
arise upon the earlier to occur of (1) discovery of any Materials of
Environmental Concern on, under or about the Property, or (2) the institution of
any Environmental Proceedings, and not upon the realization of loss or damage,
and Indemnitors shall pay to Lenders from time to time, immediately upon
request, an amount equal to such Expenses, as reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent upon submission of an invoice therefore and reasonable
supporting documentation. In addition, in the event any Materials of
Environmental Concern is removed, or caused to be removed from the Property, by
Indemnitors, Lenders or any other person, the number assigned by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to such Environmental Proceedings or any similar
identification shall in no event be in the name the of Administrative Agent or
of the Lenders or identify the Administrative Agent or the Lenders as a
generator, arranger or other such designation. The foregoing indemnity shall not
include Expenses arising solely from Materials of Environmental Concern which
first exist on the Property following the date on which the Lenders take title
to the Property, whether by foreclosure of the Mortgage, deed-in-lieu thereof or
otherwise.

     7. Remedies Upon Default. In addition to any other rights or remedies
Lenders may have under this Indemnity Agreement, at law or in equity, in the
event that Indemnitors shall fail to timely comply with any of the provisions
hereof, or in the event that any representation or warranty made herein proves
to be false or misleading in any material respect, then, in such event, after
(i) delivering written notice to Indemnitors, which notice specifically states
that Indemnitors have failed to comply with the provisions of this Indemnity
Agreement; and (ii) the expiration of the earlier to occur of the thirty (30)
day period after receipt of such notice or the cure period, if any, permitted
under any applicable law, rule, regulation or order with which Indemnitors shall
have failed to comply, Lenders may declare an Event of Default under the Loan
Documents and exercise any and all remedies provided for therein, and/or do or
cause to be done whatever is reasonably necessary to cause the Property to
comply with all Environmental Laws and the cost thereof shall constitute an
Expense hereunder and shall become immediately due and payable without notice
and with interest thereon at the Default Rate until paid. Indemnitors shall give
to Administrative Agent and its agents and employees access to the Property for
the purpose of effecting such compliance and hereby specifically grant to
Administrative Agent a license, effective upon expiration of the applicable
period as described above, if any, subject to the rights of tenants to do
whatever is reasonably necessary to cause the Property to so comply, including,
without limitation, to enter the Property and remove therefrom any Materials of
Environmental Concern or otherwise comply with any Environmental Laws.

     8. Obligations. The obligations set forth herein, including, without
limitation, Indemnitors' obligation to pay Expenses hereunder, are collectively
referred to as, the "Environmental Obligations". Notwithstanding any term or
provision contained herein or in the Loan Documents, the Environmental
Obligations are unconditional. Indemnitors shall be fully and personally liable
for the Environmental Obligations hereunder, and such liability shall not be
limited to the original principal amount of the Loan. The Environmental
Obligations shall survive the repayment of the Loan and any foreclosure,
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or similar proceedings by or through which Lenders
or any of their affiliates, nominees, successors or assigns or any other person
bidding at a foreclosure sale may obtain title to the Property or any portion
thereof.

<PAGE>

     9. Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Indemnity Agreement nor
consent to any departure by Indemnitors therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Administrative Agent
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on
Indemnitors shall in any case entitle Indemnitors to any other or further notice
or demand in similar or other circumstances.

     10. Exercise of Remedies. No failure on the part of Lenders to exercise and
no delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, at law or in equity, shall
operate as a waiver thereof. Lenders shall not be estopped to exercise any such
right or remedy at any future time because of any such failure or delay; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other
right or remedy.

     11. Assignment. The Administrative Agent and Lender may assign their
respective interests under this Indemnity Agreement to any successor to its
respective interests in the Property or the Loan Documents however, no further
assignment by any such successor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
shall be permitted. This Indemnity Agreement may not be assigned or transferred,
in whole or in part, by Indemnitors and any purported assignment by Indemnitors
of this Indemnity Agreement shall be void ab initio and of no force or effect.

     12. Counterparts. This Indemnity Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of such
counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

     13. Governing Law. This Indemnity Agreement shall be governed by, and shall
be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio.

     14. Modifications. This Indemnity Agreement may be amended or modified only
by an instrument in writing which by its express terms refers to this Indemnity
Agreement and which is duly executed by Indemnitors and consented to in writing
by Administrative Agent.

     15. Attorneys' Fees. If Administrative Agent commences litigation for the
interpretation, enforcement, termination, cancellation or rescission of this

                      CERTIFICATION FOR SURVEYS (LONG-FORM)


I hereby certify to KeyBank National Association, its successors and assigns,
and GM Olathe, LLC, and Glimcher Properties Limited Partnership, as Borrowers,
and [insert Title Insurance Company] that the survey prepared by me entitled "
________ " was actually made upon the ground and that it and the information,
courses and distances shown thereon are correct; that the title lines and lines
of actual possession are the same; that the size, location and type of buildings
and improvements are as shown and all are within the boundary lines of the
property; that the property is zoned as ___________ and any required setbacks
are as shown; that there are no easements, encroachments or use affecting this
property appearing from a careful physical inspection of the same, other than
those shown and depicted thereon; that all utility services required for the
operations of the premises either enter the premises through adjoining public
streets, or the survey shows the point of entry and location of any utilities
which pass through or are located on adjoining private land; that the survey
shows the location of all visible storm drainage systems for the collection and
disposal of all roof and surface drainage; that any discharge into streams,

                                   SCHEDULE 6
                                   ----------

                               TITLE REQUIREMENTS
                               ------------------

1.   Title Insurance Company Requirements. The maximum single risk (i.e., the
     amount insured under any one policy) by a title insurer may not exceed 25%
     of that insurer's surplus and statutory reserves. Reinsurance must be
     obtained by closing for any policy exceeding such amount.

2.   Loan Policy Forms. Standard 1992 American Land Title Association ("ALTA")
     form of loan title insurance policy, or the 1970 (amended October 17, 1970)
     ALTA loan form policies must be used.

3.   Insurance Amount. The amount insured must equal at least the original
     principal amount of the Loan.

4.   Named Insured. The named insured under the Title Policy must be
     substantially the same as the following: "KeyBank National Association, and
     its respective successors and assigns."

5.   Creditors' Rights. Any "creditors' rights" exception or other exclusion
     from coverage for voidable transactions under bankruptcy, fraudulent
     conveyance, or other debtor protection laws or equitable principles must be
     removed by either an endorsement or a written waiver.

6.   Arbitration. In the event that the form policy which is utilized includes a
     compulsory arbitration provision, the insurer must agree that such
     compulsory arbitration provisions do not apply to any claims by or on
     behalf of the insured. Please note that the 1987 and 1992 ALTA form loan
     policies include such provisions.

7.   Date of Policy. The effective date of the Title Policy must be as of the
     date and time of the closing.

8.   Legal Description. The legal description of the property contained in the
     Title Policy must conform to (a) the legal description shown on the survey
     of the property, and (b) the legal description contained in the Mortgage.
     In any event, the Title Policy must be endorsed to provide that the insured
     legal description is the same as that shown on the survey.

9.   Easements. Each Title Policy shall insure, as separate parcels: (a) all
     appurtenant easements and other estates benefiting the property, and (b)
     all other rights, title, and interests of the borrower in real property
     under reciprocal easement agreements, access agreements, operating
     agreements, and agreements containing covenants, conditions, and
     restrictions relating to the Project.

10.  Exceptions to Coverage. With respect to the exceptions, the following
     applies:

     a)   Each Title Policy shall afford the broadest coverage available in the
          state in which the subject property is located.


                               Schedule 6 - Pg. 1
<PAGE>

     b)   The "standard" exceptions (such as for parties in possession or other
          matters not shown on public records) must be deleted.

     c)   The "standard" exception regarding tenants in possession under
          residential leases, should also be deleted. For commercial properties,
          a rent roll should be attached in lieu of the general exception.

     d)   The standard survey exception to the Title Policy must be deleted.
          Instead, a survey reading reflecting the current survey should be
          incorporated.

     e)   Any exception for taxes, assessments, or other lienable items must
          expressly insure that such taxes, assessments, or other items are not
          yet due and payable.

     f)   Any lien, encumbrance, condition, restriction, or easement of record
          must be listed in the Title Policy, and the Title Policy must
          affirmatively insure that the improvements do not encroach upon the
          insured easements or insure against all loss or damage due to such
          encroachment

     g)   The Title Policy may not contain any exception for any filed or
          unfiled mechanics' or materialmen's liens.

     h)   In the event that a comprehensive endorsement has been issued and any
          Schedule B exceptions continue to be excluded from the coverage
          provided through that endorsement, then a determination must be made
          whether such exceptions would be acceptable to Bank. In the event that
          it is determined that such exception is acceptable, a written
          explanation regarding the acceptability must be submitted as part of
          the delivery of the loan documents.

If Schedule B indicates the presence of any easements that are not located on
the survey, the Title Policy must provide affirmative insurance against any loss
resulting from the exercise by the holder of such easement of its right to use
or maintain that easement. ALTA Form 103.1 or an equivalent endorsement is
required for this purpose.

1.   Endorsements. With respect to endorsements, the following applies:

     a)   Each Title Policy must include an acceptable environmental protection
          lien endorsement on ALTA Form 8.1. Please note that Form 8.1 may take
          exception for an entire statute which contains one or more specific
          sections under which environmental protection liens could take
          priority over the Mortgage; provided, however, that such specific
          sections under which the lien could arise must also be referenced.

     b)   Each Title Policy must contain an endorsement which provides that the
          insured legal description is the same as shown on the survey.

     c)   Each Title Policy must contain a comprehensive endorsement (ALTA Form
          9) if a lien, encumbrance, condition, restriction, or easement is
          listed in Schedule B to the title insurance policy.


                               Schedule 6 - Pg. 2

     d)   Lender may require the following endorsements where applicable and
          available:

          access                             doing business     reverter

1.   Other Coverages. Each Title Policy shall insure the following by
     endorsement or affirmative insurance to the extent such coverage is not
     afforded by the ALTA Form 9 or its equivalent in a particular jurisdiction:

a)   that no conditions, covenants, or restrictions of record affecting the
     property:

     (i) have been violated,
     (ii) create lien rights which prime the insured mortgage,
     (iii) contain a right of reverter or forfeiture, a right of reentry, or
     power of termination, or
     (iv) if violated in the future would result in the lien created by the
     insured mortgage or title to the property being lost, forfeited, or
     subordinated; and

b)   that except for temporary interference resulting solely from maintenance,
     repair, replacement, or alteration of lines, facilities, or equipment
     located in easements and rights of way taken as certain exceptions to each
     Title Policy, such exceptions do not and shall not prevent the use and
     operation of the Property or the improvements as used and operated on the
     effective date of the Title Policy.

1.   Informational Matters. The Policy must include, as an informational note,
     the following:

     a)   The recorded plat number together with recording information; and

     b)   The property parcel number or the tax identification number, as
          applicable.

     restrictions shown as exceptions on the Title Policy must be delivered with
     the first draft of the title commitment.
