irrevocably and unconditionally agrees, severally and for itself alone, so to
pay to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the Fronting
Bank's account the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment or
disbursement. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made such amount
available to the Administrative Agent by 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the
Business Day on which such Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent
of such payment or disbursement (it being understood that any such notice
received after noon, New York City time, on any Business Day shall be deemed to
have been received on the next following Business Day), such Lender agrees to
pay interest on such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Fronting Bank's
account forthwith on demand for each day from and including the date such amount
was to have been delivered to the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date
such amount is paid, at a rate per annum equal to (a) for the first three days

thereafter, 0.5% per annum above the latest Federal Funds Rate from time to time
in effect. Any Lender's failure to make available to the Administrative Agent
its Pro Rata Share of any such payment or disbursement shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative
Agent such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make available to the
Administrative Agent such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of any such payment or
disbursement.

which interest or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last
day thereof.

obligations of the Borrower to any Lender hereunder shall be subject to the
limitation that payments of interest shall not be required for any period for

Lender would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to such Lender

promptly distribute to the Fronting Bank or each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or
other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such payment in like
funds as received. Any payment received by the Administrative Agent later than
10:00 a.m. (New York time) shall be deemed to have been received on the
following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
accrue.

                (b)     Whenever any payment is due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and

and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the LC
     -

to share the excess payment pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that

if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the
purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each
other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid
therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required
                                 -
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
              --
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off, but subject to Section 10.10) with respect to such participation as
                        -------------
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall
be conclusive and binding in the

withholding for, any Taxes except as required by law. In addition, the Borrower
shall pay all Other Taxes.

                (b)     The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Fronting Bank, each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of
Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Fronting Bank,
such Lender or the Administrative Agent

and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and Attorney
Costs and other expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under
this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Fronting
Bank, such Lender or the Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor.

                (c)     If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or
withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to the Fronting Bank, any Lender or the Administrative Agent, then:

                        (i)     the sum payable shall be increased as necessary
                so that after making all required deductions and withholdings
                (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional
                sums payable under this Section) the Fronting Bank, such Lender
                or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an
                amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
                deductions or withholdings been made;

                        (ii)    the Borrower shall make such deductions or
                withholdings;

                        (iii)   the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
                or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority
                in accordance with applicable law; and

                        (iv) the Borrower shall also pay, without duplication,
                to the Fronting Bank, such Lender or the Administrative Agent,
                as the case may be, all additional amounts which the respective
                Person specifies as reasonably necessary to preserve the
                after-tax yield such Person would have received if such Taxes or
                Other Taxes had not been imposed.

                (d)     Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the
Borrower of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish the Administrative
Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof,
or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                (e)     If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to
the Fronting Bank, any Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
                                                                      -------
3.1(c), then such Person shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal
-----
and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office
so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Borrower which may
thereafter accrue, if such change in the judgment of such Person is not
otherwise disadvantageous to such Person or inconsistent with such Person's
internal policies.

                (f)     If the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or any
Lender receives a refund in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.1, which in the good faith judgment of such
                          -----------
Person is allocable to such payment, it shall

                                      28

<PAGE>

promptly pay such refund to the Borrower, net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including taxes) of such Person incurred in obtaining such refund, provided,
                                                                    --------
however, that the Borrower agrees to promptly return such refund to the
-------
applicable Person if it receives notice from such Person that such Person is
required to repay such refund. Nothing contained herein shall require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make its tax returns (or any other
information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) available to the
Borrower.

                Section 3.2 Illegality.
                            ----------

                (a)     If the Fronting Bank or any Lender determines that the
introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of
Law, or in the interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, in
each case after the date hereof, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank
or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the
Fronting Bank or any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make or
participate in any Credit Extensions, then, on notice thereof by the Fronting
Bank or such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, the
obligation of the Fronting Bank and all Lenders to make or participate in
Credit Extensions shall be suspended until Fronting Bank or such Lender
notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

                (b)     Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent
under this Section, the Fronting Bank or the affected Lender shall designate a
different Lending Office with respect to its Credit Extensions if such
designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand
and will not, in the sole judgment of such Person, be illegal or otherwise
disadvantageous to the Lender or inconsistent with such Person's internal
policies.

                Section 3.3 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.
                            ---------------------------------------

                (a)     If the Fronting Bank or any Lender determines that, due

any law or regulation, in each case after the date hereof, or (ii) the
                                                               --
compliance by the Fronting Bank or that Lender with any guideline or request
from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having
the force of law) after the date hereof, there shall be any increase in the
cost to the Fronting Bank or such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding
or maintaining any Credit Extensions, then the Borrower shall be liable for,
and shall from time to time, upon demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent
to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Fronting Bank or such Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to
compensate the Fronting Bank or such Lender for such increased costs; provided
                                                                      --------
that, to the extent such increased costs are not specifically related to the
Obligations, the Fronting Bank or such Lender is charging such amounts to its

Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Fronting Bank or such Lender (or its Lending

Capital Adequacy Regulation, in each case after the date hereof, affects or
would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by the
Fronting Bank or such Lender or any corporation controlling the Fronting Bank or
such Lender and (taking into consideration the Fronting Bank or such Lender's or
such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and the Fronting
Bank or such Lender's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of
such capital is increased or its rate of return is decreased as a consequence of
its Commitment, Credit Extensions, or obligations under this Agreement, then,
upon demand of the Fronting Bank or such Lender to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall pay to the Fronting Bank or such
Lender, from time to time as specified by the Fronting Bank or such Lender,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Fronting Bank or such Lender for
such increase; provided that to the extent such increased costs are not
               --------
specifically related to the Obligations, the Fronting Bank or such Lender is
charging such amounts to its customers on a non-discriminatory basis, provided,

further, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts

Subsidiaries arising out of any pending or threatened litigation will be
rendered at a time when, or in an amount such that, the Borrower or such
Subsidiary will be unable to satisfy such judgments promptly in accordance with
their terms (taking into account the maximum reasonable amount of such
judgments in any such actions and the earliest reasonable time at which such
judgments might be rendered); the cash available to the Borrower and each
relevant Subsidiary, after taking into account all other anticipated uses of
the cash of the Borrower and such Subsidiary, is anticipated to be sufficient
to pay all such judgments promptly in accordance with their terms; (x) the sum

to pay all such amounts on or in respect of debts of the Borrower and such

liability on a claim, and "claim" means (i) right of payment whether or not such
a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or

such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured, or unsecured. On the date of each issuance and renewal of a
Letter of Credit (and after giving effect to all Letters of Credit as of such
date) and the date of collateralization of a Letter of Credit, the
representations set forth in this Section 4.17 shall be true and correct with
respect to the Borrower and each Subsidiary which is a guarantor with respect to
any or all of such Letters of Credit. With respect to clauses (x) and (z), with
respect to the Subsidiaries of the Borrower, such representations and warranties
are made to the best of the knowledge of the Borrower except that such
representations and warranties are made without qualification to the extent that
the untruth or inaccuracies of any such representation or warranty could
reasonably be anticipated to result in a Materially Adverse Effect.

                    --------------------------------

        (a)     The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first
be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any

Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". The Administrative Agent will notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested
by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article VII; provided, however, that
                                           -----------  --------  -------
unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such request, the

refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and

relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to
enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished
to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the
possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

        Section 9.7 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions
                    ---------------
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the
Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the
Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), pro
                                                                        ---

any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Credit
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the
payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent.

        Section 9.8 Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity. HVB and its
                    -------------------------------------------
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the
Borrower and its Affiliates as though HVB were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, HVB or its Affiliates may receive
information regarding the Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that
may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower) and
acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to
provide such information to them. With respect to its Credit Extensions, HVB
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include HVB in its individual capacity.

        Section 9.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
                    ------------------------------
may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, resign as Administrative
Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent resigns
under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders
a successor agent for the Lenders which successor agent shall be approved by the
Borrower. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the
resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint,
after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among
the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent
hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent"
shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's
appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 10.4 and
                                             ----------     -------------
10.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
----
by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor
agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30
days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor agent as provided for above.

        Section 9.10 Withholding Tax.
                     ---------------

        If any Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of
any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all
amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or
otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by
any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this
Section, together with all costs and expenses

                                      54

(including Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Lenders under this subsection
shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement
of the Administrative Agent.

                              MISCELLANEOUS

provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, and no consent with
respect to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by the
Administrative Agent at the written request of the Required Lenders) and the
Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and then any such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or

                  -
aggregate amount of the Commitments and/or LC Obligations held by such assigning
Lender is at least $5,000,000 (unless such Lender has assigned the entire
Commitment and LC Obligations then held by it). The Borrower and the
Administrative Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until (i) written
                                                                  -

        (b)     From and after the date that the Administrative Agent notifies
the assignor Lender that it has received (and provided its consent with respect
to) an executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced
processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
                 -
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant

extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under the Credit
Documents.

        (c)     Immediately upon each Assignee's making its processing fee
payment under the Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to
be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the
addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising
therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such
Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.

interests of that Lender (the "Originating Lender") hereunder and under the

other Credit Documents; provided, however, that (i) the originating Lender's

obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating

                --

consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
except to the extent such amendment, consent or waiver would require unanimous
consent of the Lenders as described in the first proviso to Section 10.1. In the
                                           ----- -------    ------------
case of any such participation, the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit
of Sections 3.1, 3.3 and 10.5 to the extent the Lender selling such
   ------------  ---     ----
participation would be so entitled as though it were also a Lender hereunder,
and if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall
have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of
set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this
Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest
were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.

        (e)     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any
Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any
portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement and any LC Obligation
held by it in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A
of the FRB or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR ss.203.14, and such Federal
Reserve Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner
permitted under applicable law.

        (f)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fronting Bank may not assign
its obligation to issue Letters of Credit without the consent of the Borrower.

other Credit Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any
such information other than in connection with or in enforcement of this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents or in connection with other business
now or hereafter existing or contemplated with the Borrower; except to the
extent such information (a) was or becomes generally available to the public

at the Process Agent's above address, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes and directs the Process Agent to accept such service on its behalf.
The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Process Agent in connection with all
matters relating to its appointment as agent of the Borrower for such purposes,
to enter into any agreement relating to such appointment which such Process
Agent may customarily require, and to pay such Process Agent's customary fees

consents to the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding
by the mailing of copies of such process to the Borrower at its address
specified pursuant to Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.15(c) shall
                      ------------                  ----------------
affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of the

        Section 10.16 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER, THE FRONTING BANK, THE
                      --------------------
LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A
TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF
ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY
AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT
CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE BORROWER, THE FRONTING BANK, THE LENDERS
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING,
THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS
WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER
PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR
ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION
HEREOF OR THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT
DOCUMENTS.

        Section 10.17 Currency Indemnity. If, for the purposes of obtaining
                      ------------------
judgment in any court in any jurisdiction with respect to any Credit Document,
it becomes necessary to convert into the currency of such jurisdiction (the
"Judgment Currency") any amount due under any Credit Document in any currency
 -----------------
other than the Judgment Currency (the "Currency Due"), then conversion shall be
                                       ------------
made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day before the day on
which judgment is given. For this purpose, "rate of exchange" means the rate at
which the Administrative Agent is able, on the relevant date,

                                      63

<PAGE>

to purchase the Currency Due with the Judgment Currency in accordance with its
normal practice. In the event that there is a change in the rate of exchange
prevailing between the Business Day before the day on which the judgment is
given and the date of payment of the amount due, the Borrower will, on the day
of payment, pay such additional amount, if any, or be entitled to receive
reimbursement of such amount, if any, as may be necessary to ensure that the
amount paid on such date is the amount it the Judgment Currency which when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment is the
amount then due under any Credit Document in the Currency Due. If the amount of
the Currency Due which the Administrative Agent is so able to purchase is less
than the amount of the Currency Due originally due to it, the Borrower shall
indemnify and save the Administrative Agent harmless from and against loss or
damage arising as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute
an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in
any Credit Document, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of
action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Administrative
Agent from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an
amount due under any Credit Document or under any judgment or order.

        Section 10.18 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other
                      ----------------
Credit Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the
Borrower, the Fronting Bank, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings of such
Persons, verbal or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
