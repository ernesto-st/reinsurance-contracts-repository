                           THE CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE

This Certificate is a written statement prepared by Unum and may include
attachments. It tells you:
-  the coverage to which you may be entitled;
-  to whom Unum will make a payment;
-  the limitations, exclusions and requirements that apply within a plan.

ELIGIBILITY FOR COVERAGE

EMPLOYEE

If you are working for the Policyholder in an Eligible Group, the date you are
eligible for coverage is the later of:
- the Policy Effective Date; or
- the day after you complete your Waiting Period.

ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBERS

If you are an Eligible Family Member, you will be eligible to apply for
coverage on the later of:
- the Policy Effective Date; or
- the date the Employee is eligible to apply for coverage.

Although you may be eligible for coverage, your coverage will not begin until
the date shown on your SCHEDULE OF BENEFITS, subject to the timely payment of
premium for your coverage.

APPLICATION AND ENROLLMENT FOR COVERAGE

EMPLOYEE

During the initial enrollment period, you can enroll for coverage without
completing a Long Term Care Insurance Application for amounts that do not exceed
the Evidence of Insurability limits as shown in the BENEFITS AT A GLANCE. Simply
complete a benefit election form. You can obtain a benefit election form from
the Policyholder's plan administrator.

If the Policyholder pays the full amount of premium for your coverage, you do
not need to enroll for coverage. However, you may need to enroll for coverage,
by completing a benefit election form, when you pay all or a portion of the
premium.

If you enroll for coverage after the initial enrollment period, you may be
required to complete a Long Term Care Insurance Application in addition to the
benefit election form.

ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBERS

You can apply for coverage with Evidence of Insurability at any time after the
date you become eligible for coverage by completing the benefit election form
and the Long Term Care Insurance Application. These forms can be obtained from
the Policyholder or Unum.

COVERAGE EFFECTIVE DATE

Your coverage will begin at 12:01 a.m. on the latest of:
- the date you are eligible for coverage if we have received your benefit
  election form, and you applied for coverage on or before that date;
- the date you are eligible for coverage if we have received your benefit
  election form, and you applied for coverage within 31 days after your
  eligibility;
- the date Unum approves your Long Term Care Insurance application if
  Evidence of Insurability is required.







                           CERTIFICATE-1   (7/1/2005)




<PAGE>

Your Coverage Effective Date will be the date shown in your SCHEDULE OF BENEFITS
subject to the timely payment of premium for your coverage.

WHEN COVERAGE WILL BE DELAYED FOR EMPLOYEES

If you are absent from work due to injury, sickness, Temporary Layoff or Leave
of Absence on your Coverage Effective Date, coverage will not begin until you
return to work in Active Employment and we receive premium for your coverage.

TEMPORARY ABSENCE FROM WORK ONCE COVERAGE HAS BEGUN FOR EMPLOYEES

If you are on a Temporary Layoff, and if premium is paid, you will be covered
through the end of the month that immediately follows the month in which your
Temporary Layoff begins.

If you are on a Leave of Absence, and if premium is paid, you will be covered
through the end of the month that immediately follows the month in which your
Leave of Absence begins.

INCREASES IN COVERAGE

After your coverage is in force, you can apply to increase coverage, based on
the benefits available as shown in the BENEFITS AT A GLANCE, by sending us a new
benefit election form and a Long Term Care Insurance Application.

No increased or additional coverage will become effective unless we approve your
Long Term Care Insurance Application for such change. If we approve your changes
in coverage, you must pay the new premium due. You will be notified of the new
premium due amount and the date it is due.

You may apply for increases in coverage at any time. Premiums currently charged
may be adjusted due to changes or increases in coverage. Upon approval, the
change(s) you requested will replace existing benefit option(s) or your benefit
duration.

DECREASES IN COVERAGE

You have the right to lower premium by reducing coverage based on the benefits
available as shown in the BENEFITS AT A GLANCE. You can decrease coverage at any
time by sending us a new benefit election form. Premiums currently charged may
be adjusted due to changes or decreases in coverage. Your SCHEDULE OF BENEFITS
will reflect new premium due amount and the date it is due.

TERMINATION OF BENEFITS

Your benefit payments under the policy will end on the earliest of:
- the day after you are no longer Chronically Ill;
- the day after the expiration of your Licensed Health Care Practitioner's
  Certification;
- the day after you are no longer receiving Qualified Long Term
  Care Services;
- the day after your Lifetime Maximum Benefit has been reached;
- the day after you die.

TERMINATION OF COVERAGE

Your coverage will terminate on the earliest of:
- the day after your Lifetime Maximum Benefit has been reached;
- the day after the end of your Grace Period, if premiums for your coverage are
  not paid within the Grace Period;
- the day after we receive your written notification that you wish to cancel
  your coverage; or
- the day after you die.

Your coverage will also terminate on the earliest of the following events:
- the date the group policy terminates; or


                           CERTIFICATE-2   (7/1/2005)



<PAGE>

- the date you are no longer in an Eligible Group with the Policyholder; or
- the day after the pay period ends for which premiums were last paid to us by
  the Policyholder for your coverage; unless you elect to continue your coverage
  under the Continuation of Coverage provision.

CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE

You are eligible to continue coverage, upon approval of your Continuation of
Coverage form and completion of the Third Party Designation form, if any portion
of your premium:
- is paid for by the Policyholder; or
- is payroll deducted by the Policyholder.

If you meet the eligibility criteria listed below, you may elect to continue
coverage on a direct bill basis. You must contact the Policyholder or Unum to
obtain the Continuation of Coverage form and the Third Party Designation form.
You must fully complete both forms and return them to Unum, at the address
listed on the form within 60 days of:
- the date the group policy terminates; or
- the date you are no longer in an Eligible Group with the Policyholder; or
- the day after the pay period ends for which premiums were last paid to us by
  the Policyholder for your coverage.

If your coverage terminates because you are no longer eligible for coverage,
your continued coverage will remain in force under the existing group policy. If
the existing group policy terminates, your coverage will be continued under a
group continuation policy. Your continued coverage will remain in force as long
as you continue timely payment of premium when due. You must pay premium
directly to Unum for your continued coverage.

If you did not apply for coverage during the time you were otherwise eligible to
apply for coverage, or if you were not approved for coverage during the time you
were otherwise eligible for coverage, you are not eligible to apply for
Continuation of Coverage.

You may not elect to continue coverage if you are not insured under the group
policy on the date the group policy terminates.

The premium rate schedule for continued coverage may change in the future,
depending on:
- the overall use of the benefits by all insured persons; or
- changes in the benefit levels or other risk factors.

Any such change will be made for all insureds in the same class.

You may make changes at any time to your continued coverage. Changes must be
based on the current Benefit Options available under the group policy. To change
your coverage, you must contact Unum's home office for assistance. You will need
to complete the necessary forms which may include a Long Term Care Insurance
Application.

STATEMENTS

We consider any statements you make for insurance in any signed application for
coverage to be complete and true to the best of your knowledge and belief. In
the absence of fraud, all statements made in any application are considered
representations and not warranties (absolute guarantees).

If any of these statements are not complete and/or not true at the time they
were made, we can:
- reduce or deny any claim; or
- terminate your coverage from the original effective date.

No such statements made by you will be used to deny a claim unless a copy of
your statements has been given to you.

INCONTESTABILITY

If your coverage has been in force for six (6) months or less, we may:
- rescind your coverage upon a showing of misrepresentation that is material to
  the acceptance of coverage; or
- deny an otherwise valid claim relating to a Chronic Illness commencing prior
  to the expiration of such six (6) month period upon a showing of
  misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance of coverage.

If your coverage has been in force for at least six (6) months, we may:
- rescind your coverage upon a showing of misrepresentation that is both
  material to the acceptance of coverage and which pertains to the conditions
  of your Chronic Illness; or
- deny an otherwise valid claim relating to a Chronic Illness commencing during
  such six (6) months to two (2) year period, upon a showing of
  misrepresentation that is both material to the acceptance of coverage and
  which pertains to the conditions of your Chronic Illness.

If your coverage has been in force for two (2) years or more, your coverage may
be rescinded only upon a showing that you knowingly and intentionally
misrepresented relevant facts relating to your health. Your coverage can be
rescinded at any time for fraudulent misstatements. There is no time limit to
contest your coverage for such fraudulent misstatements.

If your coverage is reinstated, the time periods applicable to this provision
will be measured from the reinstatement date.

If we have paid benefits under the policy, the benefit payments may not be
recovered by us in the event that the coverage is rescinded unless the
rescission is due to your fraudulent misstatements.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION OR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE

The policy does not replace or affect the requirements for coverage by any
workers' compensation or state disability insurance.

AGENT

For all purposes of the policy, the Policyholder acts on its own behalf or as
your agent. Under no circumstances will the Policyholder be deemed our agent.

Facility is interrupted due to a stay in an acute care facility, or due to a
temporary absence, and a charge is made to reserve your LTC Facility
accommodations, you will be eligible for a Bed Reservation Benefit. We will pay
you 1/30th of the LTC Facility Monthly Benefit for each day you are absent from
the LTC Facility:
- up to 90 days per calendar year if your absence is due to a stay in an acute
  care facility; or
- up to 30 days per calendar year for a temporary absence not related to a stay
  in an acute care facility.

In no event will the total number of Bed Reservation days exceed 90 days per
calendar year. Bed Reservation payments will reduce your Lifetime Maximum
Benefit, and will no longer be available once your Lifetime Maximum Benefit has
been reached.

If your stay in a LTC Facility is interrupted while you are satisfying your
Elimination Period, such days will be used to help satisfy your Elimination
Period.

RESPITE CARE BENEFIT

a LTC Facility Monthly Benefit or a Home Care Monthly Benefit, if your coverage
includes home care, you will be eligible to receive Respite Care. The Respite
Care Benefit you will receive is equal to 1/30th of your LTC Facility Monthly
Benefit for each day you have Respite Care for up to 21 days each calendar year.
You do not need to complete your Elimination Period for Respite Care payments to
begin, and the days you are receiving Respite Care will count toward satisfying
your Elimination Period.

Respite Care can be provided in your home, an LTC Facility, an Adult Day Care
Facility or a similar facility approved by us. Such payments will reduce your
Lifetime Maximum Benefit, and will no longer be available once your Lifetime
Maximum Benefit has been reached.

Care at intervals determined by us, but no more often than every 60 days.

You will also be required to submit a Licensed Health Care Practitioner's
Certification every 12 months, as required under Section 7702B(b) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

You or your representative(s) must respond within 30 days of the request for an
updated Plan of Care, proof of continued Chronic Illness or additional
information for us to continue to evaluate and process your claim. We reserve
the right to deny your claim or stop sending you payments if the appropriate
information is not submitted.

You or your representative(s) must notify us immediately when you are no longer
Chronically Ill or you are no longer receiving Qualified Long Term Care
Services.

WHEN CLAIMS ARE PAID

Benefits payable under the policy will be paid before the end of the month for
each day for which you were entitled to benefits during the prior month. Benefit
payments will end as provided in the TERMINATION OF BENEFITS provision.

TO WHOM CLAIMS ARE PAID

All benefits are payable directly to you unless at the time of claim you or your
authorized representative have requested in writing that payment be made
otherwise.

If you are eligible to receive a benefit and you die prior to receiving the
benefit payment, any remaining benefits that are owed to you will be payable to
your probate estate, if one has been established. In the event that there is no
probate estate, the remaining benefits will be paid, at our option, to your
Family Member or to another recipient deemed by us to be entitled to such
benefits. If we pay benefits in good faith under this provision, we will have
satisfied our obligations under the policy and will not have to pay such
benefits again.

CLAIM OVERPAYMENT

If for any reason benefits have been paid for a period for which you were not
entitled to benefits, repayment of the overpayment must be made to us within 45
days of the notice to you or your representative. We may recover any amounts not
repaid by offsetting them against any amounts otherwise payable to you under the
policy or by other reasonable means.

RIGHT OF APPEAL

You have the right to appeal any claim decision. Your appeal must be in writing
and must be sent to us within 90 days of your denial notice.

We will notify you in writing if a claim or any part of a claim is denied. The
denial letter will state:
- the specific reason(s) for the denial with reference to the applicable policy
  provision(s);
- a description of any additional material or information that is necessary to
  complete the claim;
- an explanation of why the additional material or information is necessary;
- a statement describing your access to documents; and
- a statement describing your appeal and legal rights to bring suit.

If you are not satisfied with the reason for the denial, you or your authorized
representative may ask to have the claim reviewed by us. Your appeal must be in
writing and should include all supporting



                              CLAIM-2   (7/1/2005)



<PAGE>

materials or information that will help us to review the claim. We will review
your appeal and all new information submitted, and notify you or your
representative of our decision within 60 days of receiving the appeal. If
special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, you will be
notified of the reasons for the extension and the date by which we expect to
make a decision. A decision shall be made no later than 120 days following
receipt of the initial request for review. We can extend the time periods if we
have not received needed information from you. In some cases, we may request
that you provide additional information to assist in the review.

You or your authorized representative may request copies of those documents that
are relevant to your claim.



























                              CLAIM-3   (7/1/2005)



<PAGE>

                              GENERAL INFORMATION

PREMIUM DUE DATES AND PAYMENTS

All premiums due for your coverage, including any adjustments, must be paid on
or before the applicable Premium Due Date. Premium must be sent to us at 2211
Congress Street, Portland, Maine 04122 or at the address designated on the bill
for that purpose. Premiums are payable in U.S. currency only.

GRACE PERIOD

If premium for your coverage is payroll deducted, your Grace Period is the 45
consecutive days that begin with the day a premium is due. Your coverage will
remain in effect during that time. Termination of coverage will not prejudice
any payable claim for a covered loss that begins prior to termination of
coverage. There is no Grace Period for the first premium.

If premium for your coverage is billed directly to you and/or your designated
representative by Unum, your Grace Period is the 30 consecutive day period that
begins on the day you and/or your designated representative have been notified
that premium is 30 days past due. Your coverage will remain in effect during
that time. Notice will be given by first class United States mail, postage
prepaid. You and/or your designated representative will be deemed to have
received such notice five (5) days after the date of such mailing. Termination
of coverage will not prejudice any payable claim for a covered loss that begins
prior to termination of coverage. There is no Grace Period for the first
premium.

If Unum, at its sole discretion, agrees to waive your Grace Period in any
instance, such agreement will not preclude or prejudice enforcement of your
Grace Period in any other instance.

REINSTATEMENT

If your coverage terminates because a premium is not paid by the end of the
Grace Period, you may request to reinstate your coverage at any time after the
policy's termination date.

In order to reinstate coverage, the following requirements must be met:
- you must complete a Long Term Care Insurance Application;
- we must approve your Long Term Care Insurance Application; and
- you must pay all unpaid premium.

If we approve your reinstatement application, we will reinstate your coverage as
of the date it was terminated and all of its terms and conditions will apply. If
we issue a prepayment agreement and do not approve or disapprove your Long Term
Care Insurance Application within 45 days from the date of the prepayment
agreement, we will reinstate your coverage on that 45th day. The effective date
of the reinstatement will be the date your coverage terminated.

The reinstated coverage WILL NOT cover any Chronic Illness, which is excluded by
name or description in the policy.

REINSTATEMENT OF TERMINATED COVERAGE DUE TO CHRONIC ILLNESS

If you become Chronically Ill and your coverage terminates because a premium is
not paid by the end of the Grace Period, you may request to reinstate your
coverage at any time after the policy's termination date.

In order to reinstate your coverage, the following requirements must be met:
- you must provide proof that your Chronic Illness began prior to the date your
  coverage terminated; and
- you must pay all unpaid premium.




                           INFORMATION-1   (7/1/2005)




<PAGE>

If you meet these requirements, we will reinstate your coverage on the date your
coverage terminated and all the terms and conditions of the policy will apply.

The reinstated coverage WILL NOT cover any Chronic Illness, which is excluded by
name or description in the policy.

If the coverage is reinstated, the time periods applicable to this provision
will be measured from the reinstatement date.

REINSTATEMENT AFTER MILITARY SERVICE

You have the right to place your coverage in suspension while you are on a Leave
of Absence from the Policyholder for active military service. "Suspension" is a
process of placing your coverage on inactive status. No premium payments are
required while coverage is suspended, but there is no coverage during that
period of time. A request to suspend coverage due to entering full-time, active
military service must be made in writing and include the policy number.

If the duration of your active military service is five (5) years or less and
you return to Active Employment with the Policyholder within 90 days of the end
of that service, your coverage will be reactivated without evidence of
insurability so long as the policy remains in force. You must complete a written
election to restate and pay the required premium.

If you do not terminate your full-time active duty within five (5) years from
the date your coverage was suspended, or you do not reactivate your coverage
within 90 days following your return to Active Employment with the Policyholder,
your coverage will be deemed terminated as of the date suspension began. If your
coverage has terminated, you may re-apply for coverage with evidence of
insurability by filling out the benefit election form and the Long Term Care
Insurance Application so long as the policy remains in force.

WAIVER OF PREMIUM

After you have satisfied your Elimination Period, and while you are receiving
benefits under the policy and any attachments, we will waive premium payments.
However, premium payments will not be waived if you are only receiving Respite
Care Benefits or Additional Care Benefits.

If benefits are no longer payable, you must resume premium payments. We will
notify you of the amount of your next premium payment and the date it is due.

REFUND OF PREMIUM AFTER DEATH

If you die while insured under the policy, we will refund any pro rata portion
of your premium paid covering the period after your death. We will make the
refund within 30 days after we receive written notice of your death. Payment
will be made to your estate.

REFUND OF PREMIUM DUE TO CANCELLATION OF COVERAGE

In the event your coverage under the policy is cancelled by you, we will, within
30 days of the effective date of such cancellation, refund the premium paid for
any period beyond the end of the month following the date of cancellation of
coverage.

CONTINGENT NON-FORFEITURE

If your premium rates increase to a level which results in a cumulative
percentage increase in your annual premium over your initial annual premium,
that is greater than or equal to the percentage shown in the chart below based
on your original issue age, you may choose to do one (1) of the following:
(a) continue to pay the required premium;




                           INFORMATION-2   (7/1/2005)




<PAGE>

(b) reduce your benefits provided by the current coverage without the
    requirement of underwriting so that your required premium payments are not
    increased;
(c) elect to convert your coverage within 120 days of the premium increase
    effective date to a paid up status with Contingent Non-Forfeiture; or
(d) terminate your group coverage within 120 days of the premium increase
    effective date and be automatically converted to Contingent Non-Forfeiture.

The percentage increase in premium does not include increases to premium due to
changes you request be made to your Long Term Care insurance coverage.

If you stop making premium payments under (c) or (d) above, this means that the
Certificate will continue automatically with the same level of benefits, except
for a reduction in your Lifetime Maximum Benefit. Your Lifetime Maximum Benefit
under this provision will be equal to the total premium paid up to the date you
stopped paying premiums minus the total amounts of benefits already paid to you.

In no event will your Lifetime Maximum Benefit:
- be less than 30 days of your LTC Facility Monthly Benefit; or
- exceed that which would have been paid had you not stopped paying premiums.

If your coverage contains a Benefit Increase option, Inflation Protection
Benefit option, Return of Premium at Death option and/or Restoration of Benefits
option, no Benefit Increase, Inflation Protection Benefit, Return of Premium at
Death or Restoration of Benefits will be made after the end of the period for
which premiums were last remitted to us for your coverage.

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE

If your age has been misstated, any benefit payable will be changed to the
amount which the premium paid would have bought for the correct age.

If we accept premium for coverage that we would not have issued or which would
have ceased according to the correct age, our only liability is to refund the
premium for the period not covered.

CLERICAL ERROR

Clerical error or omission by us will not:
- prevent you from receiving coverage or benefits;
- entitle you to receive coverage or benefits;



                           INFORMATION-3   (7/1/2005)

<PAGE>

- affect the amount of your coverage; or
- cause your coverage to begin or continue when the coverage would not otherwise
  be effective.

CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL STATUTES

We have designed the policy to meet the qualified long term care insurance
requirements of Section 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. In the future if changes are needed to maintain the tax status of the
policy, we will make every reasonable effort to amend the policy to maintain its
tax status. The Policyholder will be given the opportunity to amend the policy
in order to preserve its favorable federal income tax treatment. Your
Certificate may be affected by any such amendments. If the required changes are
not made, the policy and your coverage may lose their status as a qualified long
term care insurance policy.

CONFORMITY WITH STATE STATUTES

Coverage under the policy may be amended as required to reflect the minimum
requirements of applicable state law.

TAX NOTE

Since benefits are paid without regard to actual charges you incur, part of the
benefit could be considered taxable income if they exceed the daily benefit
amount limit prescribed under Section 7702B(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (referred to as a "Per Diem" limit). This "Per Diem" limit is
indexed for inflation. You should consult with your tax advisor.

                                BENEFIT INCREASE


If your coverage includes:

5% SIMPLE BENEFIT INCREASE

Your LTC Facility Monthly Benefit will increase each year on the Coverage
Effective Date anniversary by 5% of your original LTC Facility Monthly Benefit.
Increases will be automatic and will occur regardless of your health and whether
or not you are eligible for or are receiving benefit payments under the policy
and attached rider(s). Your premium will not increase due to automatic increases
in your LTC Facility Monthly Benefit. Your remaining Lifetime Maximum Benefit
Amount will also increase 5%.

In the event you decide to terminate this Benefit Increase prior to a benefit
being paid, you have the right to purchase the inflated benefit amount at your
original issue age or you can revert the benefit amount to the one you chose
when you enrolled for this provision.

TERMINATION OF 5% SIMPLE BENEFIT INCREASE

Your Simple Benefit Increase will terminate on the earlier of:
- the day your coverage continues under any Non-Forfeiture Benefit; or
- the day any portion of your coverage terminates as provided in the Termination
  of Coverage provision.

POLICYHOLDER'S RIGHT TO AMEND THE PLAN

The Policyholder reserves the right, in it sole and absolute discretion, to
amend, modify, or terminate, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions
of this Plan (including any related documents and underlying policies), at any
time and for any reason or no reason. Any amendment, modification, or
termination must be in writing and endorsed on or attached to the Plan.

POLICYHOLDER'S RIGHT TO REQUEST POLICY CHANGE

The Policyholder can request a Policy change. Only an officer or registrar of
Unum can approve a change. The change must be in writing and endorsed on or
attached to the Policy.

MODIFYING OR CANCELLING THE POLICY OR A PLAN UNDER THE POLICY

The Policy can be terminated:
- by Unum; or
- by the Policyholder.

Unum may terminate the Policy by written notice of at least 45 days if:
- fewer than 10 Employee are covered by the Policy;
- the Policyholder does not promptly give Unum any information that Unum
  requires; or
- the Policyholder fails to perform any of its obligations that relate to the
  Policy.

The Policy will automatically terminate if the Policyholder does not pay all the
premiums due within the Grace period. The Policy will terminate at 12:00
midnight on the last day of the Grace Period.

The Policyholder must pay all of the premiums for the entire time that the
Policy is in effect and will be liable to Unum for any premiums that it does not
pay.

However, Unum cannot refuse to renew or otherwise terminate the Policy because
the insured persons grow older or because of the insured persons' use of the
benefits.

The Policyholder can terminate the Policy on any date if it delivers written
notice to Unum at least 45 days before the termination date.

If the Policyholder and Unum both agree, the Policy may be terminated less than
45 days after the Policyholder or Unum gives notice of termination. However, the
Policy will not be terminated during any period for which the Policyholder has
paid the premium.

If the Policy is terminated, Unum will stay pay any payable claim for an insured
person's Disability which began while this Policy was in effect.

HOW TO FILE A CLAIM

If you wish to file a claim for benefits, you should follow the claim procedures
described in your group insurance certificate. Unum must receive a completed
claim form. The form must be completed by you or your authorized representative.
If you or your authorized representative have any questions about what to do,
you or your authorized representative should contact Unum directly.

CLAIM PROCEDURES

The time periods provided in this section will apply to claims procedures under
the Policy unless a shorter time is stated in the Policy or required under state
law.

In the event that your claim is denied, either in full or in part, Unum will
notify you in writing within 90 days after your claim form was filed. Under
special circumstances Unum is allowed an additional period of not more than 90
days (180 days in total) within which to notify you of its decision. If such


                               ERISA-2 (7/1/2005)




<PAGE>

an extension is required, you will receive a written notice from Unum
indicating the reason for the delay and the date you may expect a final
decision. Unum's notice of denial shall include:
- the specific reason or reasons for denial with reference to those plan
  provisions on which the denial is based;
- a description of any additional material or information necessary to complete
  the claim and why that material or information is necessary; and
- a description of the plan's procedures and applicable time limits for
  appealing the determination, including a statement of your right to bring
  suit in federal court.

Notice of determination may be provided in written or electronic form.
Electronic notices will be provided in a form that complies with any applicable
legal requirements.

APPEAL PROCEDURES

The time period provided in this section for submitting an appeal will apply
unless a longer time period for submitting an appeal is stated in the Policy or
required under state law.

The time period provided in this section for making a final appeal decision will
apply unless a shorter time period for making a final appeal decision stated in
the Policy.

If you or your authorized representative appeal a denied claim, it must be
submitted within 90 days after you receive Unum's notice of denial. You have a
right to:
- submit a request for review, in writing, to Unum;
- upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of, all
  relevant documents as defined by applicable U.S. Department of Labor
  regulations; and
- submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to
  the claim to Unum.

Unum will make a full and fair review of the claim and all new information
submitted, whether or not presented or available at the initial determination,
and may require additional documents as it deems necessary or desirable in
making such a review. A final decision on the review shall be made not later
than 60 days following receipt of the written request for review. If special
circumstances require an extension of time for processing, you will be notified
of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the Plan expects to make
a decision. If an extension is required due to your failure to submit the
information necessary to decide the claim, the notice of extension will
specifically describe the necessary information and the date by which you need
to provide it to us. A 60-day extension of the appeal review period will begin
after you have provided that information.

The final decision on review shall be furnished in writing and shall include the
reasons for the decision with reference, again, to those Policy provisions upon
which the final decision is based. It will also include a statement describing
your access to documents and describing your right to bring civil suit under
federal law.

Notices of the determination may be provided in written or electronic form.
Electronic notices will be provided in a form that complies with any applicable
legal requirements.

Unless there are special circumstances, this administrative appeal process must
be completed before you begin any legal action regarding your claim.

Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries

In addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon
the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan.
The people who operate your Plan, called "fiduciaries" of the Plan, have a duty
to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and
beneficiaries. No one, including your Policyholder or any other person, may fire
you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from
obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.

Enforce Your Rights

If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have
a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the
decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time
schedules.

Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For
instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report
from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a
federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to
provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials. This does not apply if the materials were not sent because of reasons
beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.

If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part,
you may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen that Plan
fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for
asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of
Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should
pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the
person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, (for example, if
the courts find your claims frivolous) the court may order you to pay these
costs and fees.

Assistance with Your Questions

If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan
Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your
rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the
Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee
Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your
telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries,
Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200
Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain
publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the
publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

DISCRETIONARY ACTS

In exercising its discretionary powers under the Plan, the Plan Administrator,
or Unum as its designated Claims Administrator, will have the broadest
discretion permissible under ERISA and any other applicable laws, and its
decisions will constitute final review of your claim by the Plan. Benefits under
this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator, or Unum as its designated
Claims Administrator, decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled
to them.

                      UNUMPROVIDENT'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

UnumProvident understands your privacy is important. We value our relationship
with you and are committed to protecting the confidentiality of nonpublic
personal information (NPI). This notice explains why we collect NPI, what we do
with NPI and how we protect your privacy.

                             COLLECTING INFORMATION

We collect NPI about our customers to provide them with insurance products and
services. This may include telephone number, address, date of birth, occupation,
income and health history. We may receive NPI from your applications and forms,
medical providers, other insurers, employers, insurance support organizations,
and service providers.

                               SHARING INFORMATION

We share the types of NPI described above primarily with people who perform
insurance, business, and professional services for us, such as helping us pay
claims and detect fraud. We may share NPI with medical providers for insurance
and treatment purposes. We may share NPI with an insurance support organization.
The organization may retain the NPI and disclose it to others for whom it
performs services. In certain cases, we may share NPI with group policyholders
for reporting and auditing purposes. We may share NPI with parties to a proposed
or final sale of insurance business or for study purposes. We may also share NPI
when otherwise required or permitted by law, such as sharing with governmental
or other legal authorities. When legally necessary, we ask your permission
before sharing NPI about you. Our practices apply to our former, current and
future customers.

Please be assured we do not share your health NPI to market any product or
service. We also do not share any NPI to market non-financial products and
services. For example, we do not sell your name to catalog companies.

The law allows us to share NPI as described above (except health information)
with affiliates to market financial products and services. The law does not
allow you to restrict these disclosures. We may also share with companies that
help us market our insurance products and services, such as vendors that provide
mailing services to us. We may share with other financial institutions to
jointly market financial products and services. When required by law, we ask
your permission before we share NPI for marketing purposes.

When other companies help us conduct business, we expect them to follow
applicable privacy laws. We do not authorize them to use or share NPI except
when necessary to conduct the work they are performing for us or to meet
regulatory or other governmental requirements.

UnumProvident companies, including insurers and insurance service providers, may
share NPI about you with each other. The NPI might not be directly related to
our transaction or experience with you. It may include financial or other
personal information such as employment history. Consistent with the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, we ask your permission before sharing NPI that is not directly
related to our transaction or experience with you.

                            SAFEGUARDING INFORMATION

We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that protect the
confidentiality and security of NPI. We give access only to employees who need
to know the NPI to provide insurance products or services to you.

                              ACCESS TO INFORMATION

You may request access to certain NPI we collect to provide you with insurance
products and services. You must make your request in writing and send it to the
address below. The letter should include your full name, address, telephone
number and policy number if we have issued a policy. If you request, we will
send copies of the NPI to you. If the NPI includes health information, we may

<PAGE>

provide the health information to you through a health care provider you
designate. We will also send you information related to disclosures. We may
charge a reasonable fee to cover our copying costs.

This section applies to NPI we collect to provide you with coverage. It does not
apply to NPI we collect in anticipation of a claim or civil or criminal
proceeding.

                            CORRECTION OF INFORMATION

If you believe NPI we have about you is incorrect, please write to us. Your
letter should include your full name, address, telephone number and policy
number if we have issued a policy. Your letter should also explain why you
believe the NPI is inaccurate. If we agree with you, we will correct the NPI and
notify you of the correction. We will also notify any person who may have
received the incorrect NPI from us in the past two years if you ask us to
contact that person.

If we disagree with you, we will tell you we are not going to make the
correction. We will give you the reason(s) for our refusal. We will also tell
you that you may submit a statement to us. Your statement should include the NPI
you believe is correct. It should also include the reason(s) why you disagree
with our decision not to correct the NPI in our files. We will file your
statement with the disputed NPI. We will include your statement any time we
disclose the disputed NPI. We will also give the statement to any person
designated by you if we may have disclosed the disputed NPI to that person in
the past two years.

                               COVERAGE DECISIONS

If we decide not to issue coverage to you, we will provide you with the specific
reason(s) for our decision. We will also tell you how to access and correct
certain NPI.

            UNUMPROVIDENT UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR PRIVACY

This Notice describes your rights concerning "protected health information"
("PHI") about you. PHI is information that may identify you and that relates to
(a) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition or (b)

UnumProvident is committed to preserving the confidentiality of PHI about its
customers and in accordance with the requirements of the law, we pledge to:

we maintain about you, including PHI we created or maintained in the past. If we
make material changes to our privacy practices, copies of revised notices will
be mailed to all policyholders then covered by a health plan.

USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PHI FOR TREATMENT, PAYMENT OR OPERATIONS

- For Treatment - UnumProvident is not a health care provider and does not
  engage in "treatment" of individuals as a health care provider (a doctor, for
  example) would. Accordingly, although we are permitted to use or disclose PHI
  about you for treatment purposes, we do not do so.

- For Payment - We may use and disclose PHI about you in order to obtain
  premiums or to determine or fulfill our responsibility to provide you with
  insurance coverage or benefits under your policy. For example, we may use or
  disclose PHI about you in order to determine whether you are eligible for
  coverage or to decide your claim for benefits under your policy.

- For Health Care Operations - We may use and disclose PHI about you in order
  to operate our business. For example, we use PHI about you in order to
  underwrite your insurance policy.





* A "health plan" under the HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually
Identifiable Health Information is an individual or group plan that provides or
pays the cost of medical care.

                           NOTICE CONCERNING COVERAGE
                  LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS UNDER THE LIFE AND
                    HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION ACT


Residents of Tennessee who purchase life insurance, annuities or health
insurance should know that the insurance companies licensed in this state to
write these types of insurance are members of the Tennessee Life and Health
Insurance Guaranty Association. The purpose of this association is to assure
that policyholders will be protected, within limits, in the unlikely event that
a member insurer becomes financially unable to meet its obligations. If this
should happen, the guaranty association will assess its other member insurance
companies for the money to pay the claims of insured persons who live in this
state and, in some cases, to keep coverage in force. The valuable extra
protection provided by these insurers through the guaranty association is not
unlimited, however. This protection is not a substitute for consumers' care in
selecting companies that are well-managed and financially stable.

The state law that provides for this safety-net coverage is called the Tennessee
Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act. The following is a brief
summary of this law's coverages, exclusions and limits. This summary does not
cover all provisions of the law; nor does it in any way change anyone's rights
or obligations under the act or the rights or obligations of the guaranty
association.

COVERAGE

Generally, individuals will be protected by the Life and Health Insurance
Guaranty Association if they live in this state and hold a life or health
insurance contract, or an annuity, or if they are insured under a group
insurance contract, issued by a member insurer authorized to conduct business in
Tennessee. The beneficiaries, payees or assignees of insured persons are
protected as well, even if they live in another state.

EXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGE

However, persons holding such policies are not protected by this Association if:

- they are eligible for protection under the laws of another state (this may
  occur when the insolvent insurer was incorporated in another state whose
  guaranty association protects insureds who live outside that state);
- the insurer was not authorized to do business in this state;
- their policy was issued by a nonprofit hospital or medical service
  organization (the "Blues"), an HMO, a fraternal benefit society, a mandatory
  state pooling plan, a mutual assessment company or similar plan in which the
  policyholder is subject to future assessments, or by an insurance exchange.

The association also does not provide coverage for:

- any policy or portion of a policy which is not guaranteed by the insurer or
  for which the individual has assumed the risk, such as a variable contract
  sold by prospectus;
- any policy of reinsurance (unless an assumption certificate was issued);
- interest rate yields that exceed an average rate;
- dividends;
- credits given in connection with the administration of a policy by a group
  contractholder;
- employers' plans to the extent they are self-funded (that is, not insured by
  an insurance company, even if an insurance company administers them);
- unallocated annuity contracts (which give rights to group contractholders,
  not individuals), unless qualified under Section 403(b) of the Internal
  Revenue Code, except that, even if qualified under Section 403(b),
  unallocated annuities issued to employee benefit plans protected by the
  federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation are not covered.






                              GUAR-1   (7/1/2005)

<PAGE>

LIMITS ON AMOUNT OF COVERAGE

The act also limits the amount the Association is obligated to pay out; the
association cannot pay more than what the insurance company would owe under a
policy or contract. Also, for any one insured life, the association will pay a
maximum of $300,000 no matter how many policies and contracts that were with the
same company, even if they provided different types of coverage. Within this
overall $300,000 limit, the association will not pay more than $100,000 in cash
surrender values, $100,000 in health insurance benefits, $100,000 in present
value of annuities, or $300,000 in life insurance death benefits - again, no
matter how many policies and contracts there were with the same company, and no
matter how many different types of coverages.


................................................................................



The Tennessee Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association may not provide
coverage for this policy. If coverage is provided, it may be subject to
substantial limitations or exclusions, and require continued residency in
Tennessee. You should not rely on coverage by the Tennessee Life and Health
Insurance Guaranty Association in selecting an insurance company or in selecting
an insurance policy.

Coverage is NOT provided for your policy or any portion of it that is not
guaranteed by the insurer or for which you have assumed the risk, such as a
variable contract sold by prospectus.

Insurance companies or their agents are required by law to give or send you this
notice. However, insurance companies and their agents are prohibited by law from
using the existence of the, Guaranty Association to induce you to purchase any
kind of insurance policy.
