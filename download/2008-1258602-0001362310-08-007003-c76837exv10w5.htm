</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">This is a Master Loan Sale Agreement, dated July&nbsp;25, 2008 (&#147;<U>Master Loan Sale
Agreement</U>&#148;), among the United States Department of Education (&#147;<U>Department</U>&#148;) and
an individual Eligible Lender (as defined below) or the holder of beneficial interests
in Loans (such entity, &#147;<U>Seller</U>&#148;), and if the latter, the related Eligible Lender
Trustee, in each case made party to this Master Loan Sale Agreement by executing an
Adoption Agreement in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, pursuant to Section&nbsp;459A of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended
by the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (Pub. L. No.&nbsp;110-227)
(&#147;<U>Higher Education Act</U>&#148;), the Department has the authority to purchase
Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, on such terms as the Secretary of Education, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
jointly determine are in the best interest of the United States to encourage Eligible
Lenders to provide students and parents access to Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans made
under the Federal Family Education Loan Program for the 2008-2009 academic year;
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Seller has an ownership interest in certain Stafford Loans and
PLUS Loans guaranteed under the Higher Education Act;
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Seller may desire to sell its interest in such loans from time to
time and the Department may desire to purchase such loans from the Seller;
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, to the extent that the Department, the Seller and the Eligible Lender
Trustee (if applicable) enter into an Adoption Agreement, this Master Loan Sale
Agreement shall provide for the Seller to sell to the Department certain of such loans
by sale and transfer to the Department of all of the Seller&#146;s and the Eligible Lender
Trustee&#146;s (if applicable) right, title and interest in, to and under such loans
(including the right to service such loans) as authorized by the Higher Education Act,
all on the terms and conditions set forth below; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, by its execution of an Adoption Agreement to this Master Loan Sale
Agreement, and upon each transfer hereunder, the Seller shall represent to the
Department that it shall continue to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan
Program and that at such time as funds become reasonably available to it from private
sources, it will originate new FFELP loans or acquire FFELP loans made by other lenders
after the Department&#146;s purchases of Loans from the Seller.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, in connection with the mutual promises contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1. <U>Terms</U>. This Master Loan Sale Agreement establishes the terms
under which the Seller, together with an Eligible Lender Trustee, if any, which holds
legal title to Eligible Loans on behalf of the Seller and which is authorized to sell
Eligible Loans on behalf of the Seller, may sell, and the Department shall purchase,
the Eligible Loans (and all obligations of the Borrowers thereunder) specified on each
Loan Schedule attached to each Bill of Sale as the parties may execute from time to
time pursuant to this Master Loan Sale Agreement, subject to the terms of this Master
Loan Sale Agreement. Each such Bill of Sale
shall
be substantially in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U>, attached hereto, incorporating by reference the terms of
this Master Loan Sale Agreement, and shall be a separate agreement among the Seller, the
Eligible Lender Trustee (if applicable) and the Department with respect to the Loans
covered by the terms of such Bill of Sale for all purposes. If the terms of a Bill of
Sale conflict with the terms of this Master Loan Sale Agreement, the terms of this Master
Loan Sale Agreement shall supersede and govern except to the extent that such conflict is
specifically noted in the Bill of Sale and the parties acknowledge and agree that
notwithstanding such conflict, the terms of the Bill of Sale shall govern.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">In order to sell any Loans pursuant to this Master Loan Sale Agreement, the Seller
must notify the Department that it will sell such Loan(s) no later than August&nbsp;14, 2009,
and must complete the sale on or before September&nbsp;30, 2009. If an Eligible Lender fails
to meet one or both of these dates, the right to sell Loans hereunder shall terminate
and the Department will not honor any commitment to purchase loans.

Department receives such Notice of
Intent to Participate on or before July&nbsp;31, 2008, such Eligible Lender shall be permitted
to sell to the Department Eligible Loans that were first disbursed on or after May&nbsp;1,
2008.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">If an Eligible Lender wishes to sell a Loan to the Department that it did not
originate, both the Eligible Lender and the originating Lender must each deliver a
completed Notice of Intent to Participate to the Department prior to the date on which
it originated or acquired the Loan, as the case may be. In addition, a Loan disbursed
on or after May&nbsp;1, 2008 will be eligible for sale hereunder to the Department from the
Eligible Lender that acquired such Loan, if the Department receives the Notice of Intent
to Participate from the originating Lender by July&nbsp;31, 2008.

Lender Trustee) and that at such time as funds become reasonably available to it from
private sources, it will originate new FFELP loans or acquire FFELP loans made by other
lenders after the date of the sale of the Loans to the Department hereunder.</B>
