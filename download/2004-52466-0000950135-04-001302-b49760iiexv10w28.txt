                  (c)      Except with respect to Loans made pursuant to Section
2.18(e)(ii), each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
credit the amounts so received to an account maintained by the Administrative
Agent and then distributed as directed by Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such

date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met,
return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with paragraph (c) above, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds
available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and Borrower
severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to Borrower until the date such amount is repaid
to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount (exclusive of any interest paid
thereon by the applicable Lender in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence) shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement, and Borrower's obligation to repay the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount pursuant to this Section 2.02(d)
shall cease.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto
would end after the Revolving Maturity Date or Term Loan Maturity Date, as
applicable.

                  SECTION 2.03      BORROWING PROCEDURE. To request a
Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing, Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery
or telecopy, a duly completed and executed Borrowing Request to the
Administrative Agent (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the
proposed Borrowing or (ii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each Borrowing
Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information in
compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (a)      whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Borrowing
         of Revolving Loans or Term Loans;

                  (b)      the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

                  (c)      the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
         Day;

                  (d)      whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
         Eurodollar Borrowing;

                  (e)      in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial
         Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
         contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; provided
         that until the date on which the Administrative Agent shall have
         notified Borrower that a Successful Syndication has been achieved, the
         Interest Period shall be seven days;

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

                  (f)      the location and number of Borrower's account to
         which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
         requirements of Section 2.02(c); and

                  (g)      that the conditions set forth in Sections 4.02(b)-(d)
         have been satisfied as of the date of the notice.

                  If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then
the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is
specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration (subject to the proviso in clause (e) above). Promptly following
receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.04      EVIDENCE OF DEBT; REPAYMENT OF LOANS.
(a) Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Term Loan Lender, the principal amount of each
Term Loan of such Term Loan Lender as provided in Section 2.09, (ii) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender, the then unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Revolving Lender on the
Revolving Maturity Date and (iii) to the Swingline Lender, the then unpaid
principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity
Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or
last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such
Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is
made, Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the date
such Borrowing was requested.

                  (b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
         usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of
         Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender
         from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
         payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in
         which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the
         Type and Class thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto; (ii)
         the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become
         due and payable from Borrower to each Lender hereunder; and (iii) the
         amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for
         the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant
         to paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence of the
         existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided
         that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
         such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
         obligations of Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with their
         terms.

                  (e)      Any Lender by written notice to Borrower (with a copy
         to the Administrative Agent) may request that Loans of any Class made
         by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, Borrower shall
         prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable
         to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such
         Lender and its registered assigns) in the form of Exhibit K-I, K-2 or
         K-3, as the case may be. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such
         promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including
         after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by one or
         more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee
         named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to
         such payee and its registered assigns).

                  SECTION 2.05      FEES.

                  (a)      Commitment Fee. Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee (a
"COMMITMENT FEE") equal to 0.50% per annum on the average daily unused amount of
each Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the date
hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued
Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears (A) on the last Business Day of
March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such
date to occur after the date hereof, and (B) on the date on which such
Commitment terminates. Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
Commitment Fees with respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of
a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving
Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender
shall be disregarded for such purpose).

                  (b)      Administrative Agent Fees. Borrower agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative fees set forth
in the Fee Letter or such other fees payable in the amounts and at the times
separately agreed upon between Borrower and the Administrative Agent (the
"ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES").

                  (c)      LC and Fronting Fees. Borrower agrees to pay (i) to
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a
participation fee ("LC PARTICIPATION FEE") with respect to its participations in
Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin
(together with any additional interest that may then be applicable pursuant to
Section 2.06(c)) from time to time used to determine the interest rate on
Eurodollar Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 on the average daily amount
of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
Reimbursement Obligations) during the period from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Revolving
Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC
Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee ("FRONTING FEE"), which
shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the
LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to Reimbursement
Obligations) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and
the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing
Bank's customary fees with respect to the administration, negotiation, issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of
drawings thereunder. Accrued LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees shall be
payable in arrears (i) on the last Business Day of March, June, September and
December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
Closing Date, and (ii) on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate.
Any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank
pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand
therefor. All LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (d)      All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds in dollars, to the Administrative Agent for
distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders, except that Borrower
shall pay the Fronting Fees directly to the Issuing Bank. Once paid, none of the
Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.06      INTEREST ON LOANS. (a) Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.06(c), the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing,
including each Swingline Loan, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.

                  (b)      Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), the
Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for
such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, during a Default, all
Obligations shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, bear interest,
after as well as before judgment, at a per annum rate equal to (i) in the case
of principal of or interest on any Loan, 2% plus the rate applicable to such
Loan at such time as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 2.06
or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR
Revolving Loans as provided in Section 2.06(a).

                  (d)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to Section 2.06(c) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the
event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an
ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Loan), accrued interest on the principal
amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or
prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior
to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

                  (e)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366
days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The
applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and
such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.07      TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.
(a) The Term Loan Commitments shall automatically terminate at 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Closing Date. The Revolving Commitments, the Swingline
Commitment and the LC Commitment shall automatically terminate on the Revolving
Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all the Commitments shall
automatically terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 31, 2004, if
the initial Credit Extension shall not have occurred by such time.

                  (b)      At its option, Borrower may at any time terminate, or
from time to time permanently reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount
that is an integral multiple of $1 million and not less than $5 million, (ii)
the Revolving Commitments shall not be terminated or reduced if, after giving
effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with
Section 2.10, the aggregate amount of Revolving Exposures would exceed the
aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments and (iii) any reduction of the
Revolving Commitments shall reduce the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments and
the LC Commitment on a pro rata basis.

                  (c)      Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in
writing of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under Section
2.07(b) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

contents thereof. Each notice delivered by Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any
Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall
be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitments of such Class.

                  SECTION 2.08      INTEREST ELECTIONS. (a) Each Revolving
Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the
applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall
have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.
Thereafter, Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or
to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect
Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, Borrower shall not be entitled to request any conversion or
continuation that, if made, would result in more than five Eurodollar Borrowings
outstanding hereunder at any one time. This Section shall not apply to Swingline
Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

                  (b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section,
Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery or telecopy, a duly completed and
executed Interest Election Request to the Administrative Agent not later than
the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if
Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing of the Type
resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.
Each Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable.

                  (c)      Each Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (i)      the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
         applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
         different portions thereof, or if outstanding Borrowings are being
         combined, allocation to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
         information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below
         shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii)     the effective date of the election made pursuant to
         such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
         Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                  (iv)     if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing,
         the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
         such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition
         of the term "Interest Period"; provided that until the date on which
         the Administrative Agent shall have notified Borrower that a Successful
         Syndication has been achieved, the Interest Period shall be seven days.

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period of one month's duration (subject to the proviso in clause
(iv) above).

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
         Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
         details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting
         Borrowing.

                  (e)      If an Interest Election Request with respect to a
         Eurodollar Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the
         Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is
         repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such
         Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any
         contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may
         require, by notice to Borrower, that (i) no outstanding Borrowing may
         be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless
         repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
         Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

                  SECTION 2.09      AMORTIZATION OF TERM BORROWINGS. (a)
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders,
on the dates set forth on Annex II, or if any such date is not a Business Day,
on the immediately preceding Business Day (each such date, a "TERM LOAN
REPAYMENT DATE"), a principal amount of the Term Loans equal to the amount set
forth on Annex II for such date (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
Section 2.10(g)), together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the
principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment.

                  (b)      To the extent not previously paid, Term Loans shall
be due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

                  SECTION 2.10      OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS.

                  (a)      Optional Prepayments. Borrower shall have the right
at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part,
subject to the requirements of this Section 2.10; provided that each partial
prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1 million and
not less than $5 million.

                  (b)      Mandatory Revolving Loan Prepayments. (i) In the
event of the termination of all the Revolving Commitments, Borrower shall, on
the date of such termination, repay or prepay all outstanding Revolving
Borrowings and all outstanding Swingline Loans and replace all outstanding
Letters of Credit or cash collateralize all outstanding Letter of Credit in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.18(i).

                  (ii)     In the event of any partial reduction of the
Revolving Commitments, then (x) at or prior to the effective date of such
reduction, the Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and the Revolving
Lenders of the sum of the Revolving Exposures after giving effect thereto and
(y) if the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of
Revolving Commitments after giving effect to such reduction, then Borrower
shall, on the date of such reduction, first, repay or prepay Swingline Loans,
second, repay or prepay Revolving Borrowings and third, replace outstanding
Letters of Credit or cash collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.18(i), in an aggregate
amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                  (iii)    In the event that the sum of all Lenders' Revolving
Exposures exceeds the Revolving Commitments then in effect, Borrower shall,
without notice or demand, immediately first, repay or prepay Revolving
Borrowings, and second, replace outstanding Letters of Credit or cash

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.18(i), in an aggregate amount sufficient to eliminate
such excess.

                  (iv)     In the event that the aggregate amount of outstanding
Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans exceeds the Aggregate Revolving Loan
Commitments, Borrower shall, without notice or demand, immediately repay or
prepay Revolving Loans and/or Swingline Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient
to eliminate such excess.

                  (v)      In the event that the aggregate LC Exposure exceeds
the LC Commitment then in effect, Borrower shall, without notice or demand,
immediately replace outstanding Letters of Credit or cash collateralize
outstanding Letters of Credit in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.18(i), in an aggregate amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                  (c)      Mandatory Asset Sale Prepayments. Not later than one
Business Day following the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale by
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, Borrower shall apply an amount equal to
100% of such Net Cash Proceeds to make prepayments in accordance with Sections
2.10(g) and (h); provided that:

                  (i)      so long as no Default shall then exist or would arise
         therefrom, no such prepayment shall be required under this Section
         2.10(c) with respect to (A) any Asset Sale permitted by Section
         6.06(a), (B) the disposition of property which constitutes a Casualty
         Event, or (C) Asset Sales for fair market value resulting in no more
         than $100,000 in Net Cash Proceeds per Asset Sale (or series of related
         Asset Sales) and less than $3 million in Net Cash Proceeds in any
         fiscal year; provided that clause (C) shall not apply in the case of
         any Asset Sale described in clause (b) of the definition thereof or,
         with respect to Net Cash Proceeds in an amount not to exceed $15
         million in the aggregate, Section 6.06(c); and

                  (ii)     so long as no Default shall then exist or would arise
         therefrom, the Net Cash Proceeds in an aggregate amount not to exceed
         $25 million in any fiscal year in respect of any Asset Sales permitted
         under Section 6.06(c) (to the extent not excluded from the prepayment
         requirement pursuant to paragraph (c)(i) above) and any other Asset
         Sales shall not be required to be so applied on such date to the extent
         that (A) Borrower shall have delivered an Officers' Certificate to the
         Administrative Agent on or prior to such date stating that such Net
         Cash Proceeds are expected to be reinvested in fixed or capital assets
         within 365 days following the date of such Asset Sale (which Officers'
         Certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be so
         expended); and (B) all Net Cash Proceeds in respect of all Asset Sales
         (other than those referred to in clause (C) of Section 2.10(c)(i)) in
         excess of $3 million in the aggregate at any time shall be held in the
         Collateral Account and released therefrom only in accordance with the
         provisions of Article IX; provided that if all or any portion of such
         Net Cash Proceeds is not so reinvested within such 365-day period, such
         unused portion shall be applied on the last day of such period as a
         mandatory prepayment as provided in this Section 2.10(c); and provided,
         further, that if the property subject to such Asset Sale constituted
         Collateral, then all property purchased with the Net Cash Proceeds
         thereof pursuant to this subsection shall be made subject to the Lien
         of the applicable Security Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent,
         for its benefit and for the benefit of the other Secured Parties in
         accordance with Sections 5.11 and 5.12.

in accordance with Sections 2.10(g) and (h) in an aggregate principal amount
equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds.

                  (e)      Casualty Events. Not later than one Business Day
following the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from a Casualty Event by Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, Borrower shall apply an amount equal to 100% of such
Net Cash Proceeds to make prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(g) and
(h); provided that:

                  (i)      so long as no Default shall then exist or arise
         therefrom, such proceeds shall not be required to be so applied on such
         date to the extent that Borrower shall have delivered an Officers'
         Certificate to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such date
         stating that such proceeds are expected to be used to repair, replace
         or restore any property in respect of which such Net Cash Proceeds were
         paid, no later than 365 days following the date of receipt of such
         proceeds; provided that if the property subject to such Casualty Event
         constituted Collateral under the Security Documents, then all property
         purchased with the Net Cash Proceeds thereof pursuant to this
         subsection shall be made subject to the Lien of the applicable Security
         Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and for the
         benefit of the other Secured Parties in accordance with Sections 5.11
         and 5.12;

                  (ii)     all Net Cash Proceeds in respect of all Casualty
         Events in excess of $3 million in the aggregate shall be held in the
         Collateral Account and released therefrom only in accordance with the
         provisions of Article IX; and

                  (iii)    if any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds shall not be
         so applied within such 365-day period, such unused portion shall be
         applied on the last day of such period as a mandatory prepayment as
         provided in this Section 2.10(e).

                  (f)      Mandatory Excess Cash Flow Prepayment. No later than
         the earlier of (i) 90 days after the end of each Excess Cash Flow
         Period and (ii) the date on which the financial statements with respect
         to such fiscal year in which such Excess Cash Flow Period occurs are
         delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a), Borrower shall make prepayments
         in accordance with Sections 2.10(g) and (h) in an aggregate principal
         amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow
         Period unless the Total Funded Debt Leverage Ratio for the Test Period
         ending on the last day of such Excess Cash Flow Period is equal to or
         less than 2.50 to 1.00, in which case no such prepayment shall be
         required.

                  (g)      Application of Prepayments. (i) Prior to any optional
         or mandatory prepayment hereunder, Borrower shall select the Borrowing
         or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the
         notice of such prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(h), subject to the
         provisions of this Section 2.10(g). Any prepayments of Loans required
         or made pursuant to Section 2.10 (a), (c), (d), (e) or (f) shall be
         applied to reduce scheduled amortization payments required under
         Section 2.09(a), on a pro rata basis among such amortization payments
         as are remaining to be made on each remaining Term Loan Repayment Date.
         After application of mandatory prepayments described above in this
         Section 2.10(g) and to the extent there are mandatory prepayment
         amounts remaining after such application in respect of any prepayment
         required pursuant to Section 2.10(c) or (f), the Revolving Commitments
         shall be permanently reduced ratably among the Revolving Lenders in
         accordance with their applicable Revolving Commitments in an aggregate
         amount equal to such excess, and Borrower shall comply with Section
         2.10(b).

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     Amounts to be applied pursuant to this Section 2.10
to the prepayment of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be applied, as
applicable, first to reduce outstanding ABR Term Loans and ABR Revolving Loans,
respectively. Any amounts remaining after each such application shall be applied
to prepay Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Loans, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of any prepayment of Loans required
under this Section 2.10 shall be in excess of the amount of the ABR Loans at the
time outstanding (an "EXCESS AMOUNT"), only the portion of the amount of such
prepayment as is equal to the amount of such outstanding ABR Loans shall be
immediately prepaid and, at the election of Borrower, the balance of such
required prepayment shall be either (A) deposited in the Collateral Account and
applied to the prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on the last day of the then
next-expiring Interest Period for Eurodollar Loans; provided that (i) interest
in respect of such Excess Amount shall continue to accrue thereon at the rate
provided hereunder for the Loans which such Excess Amount is intended to repay
until such Excess Amount shall have been used in full to repay such Loans and
(ii) at any time while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, and upon written direction from the Required Lenders
shall, apply any or all proceeds then on deposit in the Collateral Account to
the payment of such Loans in an amount equal to such Excess Amount or (B)
prepaid immediately, together with any amounts owing to the Lenders under
Section 2.13.

                  (h)      Notice of Prepayment. Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the
Swingline Lender) by written notice of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case
of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case
of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment and (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable. Each such
notice shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing
or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a
reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment. Promptly
following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to
Swingline Loans), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
contents thereof. Such notice to the Lenders may be by electronic communication.
Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be
permitted in the case of a Credit Extension of the same Type as provided in
Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a
mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to
the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing and otherwise in accordance with
this Section 2.10. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.06.

                  SECTION 2.11      ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. If prior to
the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a)      the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which
         determination shall be final and conclusive absent manifest error) that
         adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
         Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period; or

                  (b)      the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by the
         Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period
         will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
         making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such
         Interest Period;

                                      -47-

<PAGE>

then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof to Borrower and
the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative
Agent notifies Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to
such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the
conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request
requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.12      INCREASED COSTS. (a) If any Change in
Law shall:

                  (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
         special deposit or similar requirement against property of, deposits
         with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except
         any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBOR Rate) or
         the Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii)     impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
         London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
         Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
         participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender, the
Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, of
participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the
amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then Borrower will pay
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered, it being
understood that this Section 2.12 shall not apply to Taxes.

                  (b)      If any Lender or the Issuing Bank reasonably
determines in good faith (which determination shall be final and conclusive
absent manifest error) that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made
by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters
of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or
the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could
have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time
to time Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, upon delivery of a certificate of such Lender or Issuing Bank in accordance
with paragraph (c) below, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c)      A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting
forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as
specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.12 shall be delivered to
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within
5 days after receipt thereof.

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such
compensation; provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended back to the date of
effectiveness of the Change in Law so long as Borrower receives notice thereof
on or before the date that is 180 days after the enactment of such Change in
Law.

                  SECTION 2.13      BREAKAGE PAYMENTS. In the event of (a)
the payment or prepayment, whether optional or mandatory, of any principal of
any Eurodollar Loan earlier than the last day of an Interest Period applicable
thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of
any Eurodollar Loan earlier than the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving
Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan earlier than the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant
to Section 2.16, then, in any such event, Borrower shall compensate each Lender
for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate that would have been
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 2.13 shall be delivered to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. Borrower shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 5 days
after receipt thereof.

                  SECTION 2.14      PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT;
SHARING OF SETOFFS. (a) Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by
it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest,
fees or Reimbursement Obligations, or of amounts payable under Section 2.12,
2.13 or 2.15, or otherwise) on or before the time expressly required hereunder
or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim,
other than deductions for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes. Any amounts received
after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent,
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes
of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the
Administrative Agent at its offices at 677 Washington Boulevard, Stamford,
Connecticut, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 and 11.03 shall be made directly to the persons
entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to
the persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any
such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is
not a Business Day, unless specified otherwise, the date for payment shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment
accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such
extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars,
except as expressly specified otherwise.

                  (b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
Reimbursement Obligations, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and Reimbursement Obligations then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal
and Reimbursement Obligations then due to such parties.

                  (c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
setoff or counterclaim or otherwise (including by exercise of its rights under
Section 9.1(a)(viii) of the Security Agreement), obtain payment in respect of
any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or
participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender
receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its
Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline
Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other
Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for
cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans, LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan
Party in the amount of such participation. If under applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or any similar law any Secured Party receives a secured claim in lieu
of a setoff or counterclaim to which this Section 2.14(c) applies, such Secured
Party shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such
secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights to which the Secured Party
is entitled under this Section 2.14(c) to share in the benefits of the recovery
of such secured claim.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that Borrower will
not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has
made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon
such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally
agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

                  (e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required
to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.14(d), 2.17(d), 2.18(d), 2.18(e)
or 11.03(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy
such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied
obligations are fully paid.

                  SECTION 2.15      TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by or
on account of any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense and free
and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any and all Indemnified
Taxes; provided that if any Indemnified Taxes are required to be deducted or
withheld from such payments, then (i) the sum payable by Borrower shall be
increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or withholdings
(including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.15) the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) Borrower shall
make, or cause to be made, such deductions or withholdings and (iii) Borrower
shall pay, or cause to be paid, the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b)      In addition, Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c)      Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 Business Days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 2.15) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower
by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own
behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

                  (d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to Section 2.15(a) or (b) above, and
in any event within 30 days of any such payment being due, Borrower shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e)      Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law,
such

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and
reasonably requested (in writing) by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as
will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
In addition, each Foreign Lender shall (i) furnish on or before it becomes a
party to this Agreement either (a) two accurate and complete originally executed
U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) or (b) an accurate
and complete U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form),
certifying, in either case, to such Foreign Lender's legal entitlement to an
exemption or reduction from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to all
interest payments hereunder, and (ii) provide a new Form W-8BEN (or successor
form) or Form W-8ECI (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of
any previously delivered form to reconfirm any complete exemption from, or any
entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to any
interest payment hereunder; provided that any Foreign Lender that is not a
"bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and is relying on
the so-called "portfolio interest exemption" shall also furnish a "Non-Bank
Certificate" in the form of Exhibit Q together with a Form W-8BEN.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Foreign Lender shall
not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Foreign
Lender is not legally able to deliver.

                  (f)      If the Administrative Agent or a Lender (or an
assignee) determines in its reasonable discretion that it has received a refund
of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by
Borrower or with respect to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant
to this Section 2.15, so long as there is no Default, it shall pay over such
refund to Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section 2.15 with respect to the
Indemnified Taxes or the Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or assignee)
and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided, however, that Borrower, upon
the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or assignee), agrees to
repay the amount paid over to Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative
Agent or such Lender (or assignee) within a reasonable time (not to exceed 20
days) after receipt of written notice that the Administrative Agent or such
Lender (or assignee) is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority. Nothing contained in this Section 2.15(f) shall require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender (or assignee) to make available its tax
returns or any other information which it deems confidential to Borrower or any
other person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event will any
Lender be required to pay any amount to Borrower the payment of which would
place such Lender in a less favorable net after-tax position than such Lender
would have been in if Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes had never been imposed.

                  SECTION 2.16      MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF
LENDERS.

                  (a)      Mitigation of Obligations. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender,
such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii)
would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

with any such designation or assignment. A certificate setting forth such costs
and expenses in reasonable detail submitted by such Lender to the Administrative
Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (b)      Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation
to fund Loans hereunder, then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon
notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 11.04), all of its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee selected by Borrower that shall
assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that (i) Borrower shall have received the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving
Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender), which
consents shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have
received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (assuming
for this purpose that the Loans of such Lender were being prepaid) from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of
any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12
or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will
result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall
not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as
a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling
Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                  SECTION 2.17      SWINGLINE LOANS.

                  (a)      Swingline Commitment. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans
to Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i)
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $7.5
million or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the total
outstanding Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not
be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan.
Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

                  (b)      Swingline Loans. To request a Swingline Loan,
Borrower shall deliver, by hand delivery or telecopy, a duly completed and
executed Borrowing Request to the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender,
not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline
Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date
(which shall be a Business Day) and the amount of the requested Swingline Loan.
Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. The Swingline Lender shall make each
Swingline Loan available to Borrower by means of a credit to an account
maintained by the Administrative Agent for Borrower and then distributed as
directed by Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request (or, in the case of a
Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
provided in Section 2.18(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. Borrower shall
not request a Swingline Loan if at the time of or immediately after giving
effect to the Extension of Credit contemplated by such request a Default has
occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom. Swingline Loans shall be
made in minimum amounts of $1 million and integral multiples of $500,000 above
such amount.

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

                  (c)      Prepayment. Borrower shall have the right at any time
and from time to time to repay any Swingline Loan, in whole or in part, upon
giving written notice to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent
before 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the proposed date of repayment.

                  (d)      Participations. The Swingline Lender may at any time
in its discretion by written notice given to the Administrative Agent (provided
such notice requirement shall not apply if the Swingline Lender and the
Administrative Agent are the same entity) not later than 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on the next succeeding Business Day following such notice require the
Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a
portion of the Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such notice shall specify the
aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate.
Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice
thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Pro
Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above,
to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender,
such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each
Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever (so long as such
payment shall not cause such Lender's Revolving Exposure to exceed such Lender's
Revolving Commitment). Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation
under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the
same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to Loans made by such
Lender (and Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of any
participations in any Swingline Loan acquired by the Revolving Lenders pursuant
to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan
shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any
amounts received by the Swingline Lender from Borrower (or another party on
behalf of Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the
Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be
promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent. Any such amounts received by the
Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
paragraph, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a
Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve Borrower of any
default in the payment thereof.

                  SECTION 2.18      LETTERS OF CREDIT

                  (a)      General. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Borrower may request the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank
agrees, to issue Letters of Credit for Borrower's own account or the account of
a Subsidiary in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving
Availability Period (provided that Borrower shall be a co-applicant, and be
jointly and severally liable, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for
the account of a Subsidiary). The Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to
issue, and Borrower shall not request the issuance of, any Letter of Credit at
any time if after giving effect to such issuance, the LC Exposure would exceed
the LC Commitment or the total Revolving Exposure would exceed the total
Revolving Commitments. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter
of credit application or

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

other agreement submitted by Borrower to, or entered into by Borrower with, the
Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

                  (b)      Request for Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension;
Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit, Borrower
shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) an LC Request
to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on
the third Business Day preceding the requested date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (or such later date and time as is acceptable to the
Issuing Bank).

                  A request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit shall
specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank:

                  (i)      the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of
         Credit (which shall be a Business Day);

                  (ii)     the amount thereof;

                  (iii)    the expiry date thereof (which shall not be later
         than the close of business on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date);

                  (iv)     the name and address of the beneficiary thereof;

                  (v)      whether the Letter of Credit is to be issued for its
         own account or for the account of one of its Subsidiaries (provided
         that Borrower shall be a co-applicant, and therefore jointly and
         severally liable, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for the
         account of a Subsidiary);

                  (vi)     the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in
         connection with any drawing thereunder;

                  (vii)    the full text of any certificate to be presented by
         such beneficiary in connection with any drawing thereunder; and

                  (viii)   such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require.

                  A request for an amendment, renewal or extension of any
outstanding Letter of Credit shall specify in form and detail reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuing Bank:

                  (i)      the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
         extended;

                  (ii)     the proposed date of amendment, renewal or extension
         thereof (which shall be a Business Day);

                  (iii)    the proposed expiry date thereof (which shall not be
         later than the close of business on the Letter of Credit Expiration
         Date);

                  (iv)     the nature of the proposed amendment, renewal or
         extension; and

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

                  (v)      such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require.

                  If requested by the Issuing Bank, Borrower also shall submit a
letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection
with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued,
amended, renewed or extended only if (and, upon issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of each Letter of Credit, Borrower shall be deemed to represent and
warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Commitment, (ii) the
total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments and
(iii) the conditions set forth in Article IV in respect of such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension shall have been satisfied. Unless the Issuing
Bank shall agree otherwise, no Letter of Credit shall be in an initial amount
less than $100,000, in the case of a Commercial Letter of Credit, or $500,000,
in the case of a Standby Letter of Credit.

                  (c)      Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire
at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) in the case of a
Standby Letter of Credit, (x) the date which is one year after the date of the
issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) or such later date
as may be agreed by the Issuing Bank and (y) the Letter of Credit Expiration
Date and (ii) in the case of a Commercial Letter of Credit, (x) the date that is
180 days after the date of issuance of such Commercial Letter of Credit (or, in
the case of any renewal or extension thereof, 180 days after such renewal or
extension) and (y) the Letter of Credit Expiration Date. If Borrower so
requests, the Issuing Bank may, in its reasonable discretion, agree to issue a
Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an "AUTO-RENEWAL
LETTER OF CREDIT"); provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must
permit the Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal at least once in each
twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day
in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of
Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Bank, Borrower shall
not be required to make a specific request to the Issuing Bank for any such
renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving
Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing
Bank to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry
date not later than the earlier of (i) one year from the date of such renewal
and (ii) the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided that the Issuing Bank
shall not permit any such renewal if (x) the Issuing Bank has determined that it
would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its
renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section
2.18(l) or otherwise), or (y) it has received notice on or before the day that
is two Business Days before the date which has been agreed upon pursuant to the
proviso of the first sentence of this paragraph, (1) from the Administrative
Agent that any Revolving Lender directly affected thereby has elected not to
permit such renewal or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or Borrower
that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 are not
then satisfied.

                  (d)      Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the
Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably grants to each Revolving Lender, and each
Revolving Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such
Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the
aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of
each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by Borrower on
the date due as provided in Section 2.18(e), or of any reimbursement payment

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

required to be refunded to Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e)      Reimbursement. (i) If the Issuing Bank shall make any
LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such
LC Disbursement is made if Borrower shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by Borrower prior to such time on such date, then
not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately
following the day that Borrower receives such notice; provided that Borrower
may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in
accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with ABR Revolving
Loans in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, Borrower's
obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the
resulting ABR Revolving Loans.

                  (ii)     If Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the
Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the
payment then due from Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender's
Pro Rata Percentage thereof. Each Revolving Lender shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00
p.m., New York City time, on such date (or, if such Revolving Lender shall have
received such notice later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on any day, not
later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business
Day), an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the
unreimbursed LC Disbursement in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c)
with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender, and the
Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent will
promptly pay to the Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from Borrower
pursuant to the above paragraph prior to the time that any Revolving Lender
makes any payment pursuant to the preceding sentence and any such amounts
received by the Administrative Agent from Borrower thereafter will be promptly
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have
made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as appropriate.

                  (iii)    If any Revolving Lender shall not have made its Pro
Rata Percentage of such LC Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as
provided above, each of such Revolving Lender and Borrower severally agrees to
pay interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date such
amount is required to be paid in accordance with the foregoing to but excluding
the date such amount is paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank at (i) in the case of Borrower, the rate per annum set forth in
Section 2.18(h) and (ii) in the case of such Lender, at a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules or practices on
interbank compensation.

                  (f)      Obligations Absolute. The Reimbursement Obligation of
Borrower as provided in Section 2.18(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable, and shall be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any

                                      -57-

<PAGE>

term or provision therein; (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
Letter of Credit being proved to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect; (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document that fails to comply with the terms of
such Letter of Credit; (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether
or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of
this Section 2.18, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a
right of setoff against, the obligations of Borrower hereunder; (v) the fact
that a Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or (vi) any material
adverse change in the business, property, results of operations, prospects or
condition, financial or otherwise, of Borrower and its Subsidiaries. None of the
Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or any of their Affiliates shall have any
liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or
transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment
thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the
preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in
transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or
relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from
liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to
consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by Borrower
to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by Borrower that are caused
by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts
and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank
may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

                  (g)      Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall
promptly give written notice to the Administrative Agent and Borrower of such
demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC
Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving
such notice shall not relieve Borrower of its Reimbursement Obligation to the
Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement
(other than with respect to the timing of such Reimbursement Obligation set
forth in Section 2.18(e)).

                  (h)      Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any
LC Disbursement, then, unless Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest payable on demand, for each day from and including the date such
LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that Borrower reimburses such
LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum determined pursuant to Section 2.06(c).
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Revolving Lender pursuant to Section 2.18(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank
shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                                      -58-

<PAGE>

                  (i)      Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that Borrower receives notice from
the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the
Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph, Borrower shall deposit in the LC
Sub-Account, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the
Revolving Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date
plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to
deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to
Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Article VIII. Funds in the LC
Sub-Account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of outstanding
Reimbursement Obligations or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated
(but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement. If Borrower is required to provide
an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event
of Default, such amount plus any accrued interest or realized profits with
respect to such amounts (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be
returned to Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have
been cured or waived.

                  (j)      Additional Issuing Banks. Borrower may, at any time
and from time to time, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders to act
as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement, with the consent of the
Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the
Issuing Bank and such Revolving Lender(s). Any Lender designated as an issuing
bank pursuant to this paragraph (j) shall be deemed (in addition to being a
Revolving Lender) to be the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit
issued or to be issued by such Revolving Lender, and all references herein and
in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall, with respect to
such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Revolving Lender in its
capacity as Issuing Bank, as the context shall require.

                  (k)      Resignation or Removal of the Issuing Bank. The
Issuing Bank may resign as Issuing Bank hereunder at any time upon at least 30
days' prior notice to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and Borrower. The
Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower,
each Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank or any such additional Issuing Bank. At the time any such
resignation or replacement shall become effective, Borrower shall pay all unpaid
fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.05(c). From and after the effective date of any such resignation or
replacement or addition, as applicable, (i) the successor or additional Issuing
Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and
(ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to
such successor or such addition or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such
successor or such addition and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall
require. After the resignation or replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or replacement, but
shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. If at any time
there is more than one Issuing Bank hereunder, Borrower may, in its discretion,
select which Issuing Bank is to issue any particular Letter of Credit.

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

                  (l)      Other. The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation
to issue any Letter of Credit if:

                  (i)      any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
         Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or
         restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any
         law applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether
         or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with
         jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the
         Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally
         or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing
         Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or
         capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise
         compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall
         impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense
         which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Issuing Bank
         in good faith deems material to it; or

                  (ii)     the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate
         one or more policies of the Issuing Bank.

                  The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any
Letter of Credit if (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time
to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or
(B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed
amendment to such Letter of Credit.

                  (m)      Existing Issuing Bank Letters of Credit. Set forth on
Schedule 2.18(m) is a description of certain letters of credit (together with
the outstanding balances thereof as of the Closing Date) that were previously
issued by the Issuing Bank for Borrower's account or for the account of a
Subsidiary (collectively, the "EXISTING ISSUING BANK LETTERS OF CREDIT"). On and
after the Closing Date and upon the fulfillment of each of the conditions set
forth in Section 4.01, each such Existing Issuing Bank Letter of Credit shall be
deemed and treated for all purposes hereof (including, without limitation, the
calculation of applicable fees under Section 2.05(c) and the calculation of LC
Exposure) as a "Letter of Credit" hereunder, any participation interest of any
Lender existing on or prior to the Closing Date in each such Existing Issuing
Bank Letter of Credit shall, without further action, be deemed to have been
extinguished in full and the Issuing Bank, without further action, shall be
deemed to have issued each such Existing Issuing Bank Letter of Credit as
provided in this Section 2.18.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Each Loan Party represents and warrants to the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and each of the Lenders (with
references to the Companies being references thereto after giving effect to the
Transactions unless otherwise expressly stated) that:

                  SECTION 3.01      ORGANIZATION; POWERS. Each Company (a)
is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (b) has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business
as now conducted and to own and lease its property and (c) is qualified and in
good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable in the applicable
jurisdiction) to do business in every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or be in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. There is no existing default
under any Organizational Document of

                                      -60-

<PAGE>

each Company or any event which, with the giving of notice or passage of time or
both, would constitute a default by any party thereunder. Copies of the
Organizational Documents of each Company previously delivered to the
Administrative Agent are true and complete and have not been amended or modified
since the date of such delivery.

                  SECTION 3.02      AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. The
Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's
powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such
Loan Party. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Loan
Party and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is
to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute,
a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally
and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law.

                  SECTION 3.03      NO CONFLICTS. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.03, the Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of,
registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority,
except (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect,
(ii) filings necessary to perfect Liens created by the Loan Documents and (iii)
consents, approvals, registrations, filings, permits or actions the failure of
which to obtain or perform could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate the Organizational Documents of
any Company or any judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Authority, (c)
will not violate or result in a default or require any consent or approval under
any indenture, agreement, Organizational Document or other instrument binding
upon any Company or its property, or give rise to a right thereunder to require
any payment to be made by any Company, except for violations, defaults or the
creation of such rights that could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any property of any Company, except Liens created by the Loan
Documents and Permitted Liens.

                  SECTION 3.04      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) Borrower has
heretofore furnished to the Lenders the consolidated balance sheets and related
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of Borrower and the
Acquired Business (i) as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31 in each
of 2000, 2001 and 2002 in respect of Borrower, audited by and accompanied by the
unqualified opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public
accountants, and for the fiscal years ended September 30 in each of 2001, 2002
and 2003 in respect of the Acquired Business, audited by and accompanied by the
unqualified opinion of KPMG, LLP, independent public accountants, and (y) as of
and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 in respect of Borrower
and for the three-month period ended December 31, 2003 in respect of the
Acquired Business and for the comparable period of the preceding fiscal year, in
each case in respect of Borrower's financial statements, certified by the chief
financial officer of Borrower. Such financial statements and all financial
statements delivered pursuant to Sections 5.01(a), (b) and (c) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and present fairly and
accurately in all material respects the financial condition and results of
operations and cash flows of Borrower and the Acquired Business as of the dates
and for the periods to which they relate. Except as set forth in such financial
statements, there are no liabilities of any Company of any kind, whether
accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, which
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and there
is no existing condition, situation or set of circumstances which could
reasonably be expected to result in such a liability, other than liabilities
under the Loan Documents.

                                      -61-

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Borrower has heretofore delivered to the Lenders
Borrower's unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statements of
income and cash flows, pro forma EBITDA, for the four-quarter period ending
September 30, 2003, in each case after giving effect to the Transactions as if
they had occurred on such date in the case of the balance sheet and as of the
beginning of all periods presented in the case of the statements of income and
cash flows. Such pro forma financial statements have been prepared in good faith
by the Loan Parties, based on the assumptions stated therein (which assumptions
are believed by the Loan Parties on the date hereof to be reasonable), are based
on the best information available to the Loan Parties as of the date of delivery
thereof, accurately reflect all adjustments required to be made to give effect
to the Transactions, in accordance with Regulation S-X, and present fairly in
all material respects the pro forma consolidated financial position and results
of operations of Borrower and the Acquired Business as of such date and for such
periods, assuming that the Transactions had occurred at such dates.

                  Since September 30, 2003, there has been no event, change,
circumstance or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or indicates
a material worsening in respect of the business, property, results of
operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Acquired Business and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

                  SECTION 3.05      PROPERTIES. (a) Each Company has good
and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its property
material to its business, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted
Collateral Liens. The property of the Companies, taken as a whole, (i) is in
good operating order, condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted),
except to the extent that the failure to be in such condition could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
constitutes all the property which is required for the business and operations
of the Companies as presently conducted.

                  (b)      Schedule 3.05(b) contains a true and complete list of
each interest in Real Property owned, leased or subleased by any Company as of
the date hereof and (i) if owned by any Company as of the date hereof, describes
the type of interest therein held by such Company and (ii) if leased, subleased
or otherwise occupied or utilized by any Company, as lessee, sublessee,
franchisee or licensee, as of the date hereof, describes the type of interest
therein held by such Company and whether such lease, sublease or other
instrument requires the consent of the landlord thereunder or other parties
thereto to the Transactions.

                  (c)      No Company has received any notice of, nor has any
knowledge of, the occurrence or pendency or contemplation of any Casualty Event
affecting all or any portion of its Real Property that has or could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d)      Each Company owns or has rights to use all of the
Collateral and all rights with respect to any of the foregoing used in,
necessary for or material to each Company's business as currently conducted. The
use by each Company of such Collateral and all such rights with respect to the
foregoing do not infringe on, misappropriate or violate the rights of any person
other than such infringement, misappropriation or violation which could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. No claim has been made and remains outstanding that any
Company's use of any Collateral does or may violate the rights of any third
party that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

                  (e)      The Equipment of each Company is in good repair,
working order and condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Each Company
shall cause the Equipment to be maintained and preserved in good repair, working
order and condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and shall as quickly as
commercially practicable make or cause to be made all repairs, replacements and
other improvements which are necessary or appropriate in the conduct of each
Company's business.

                  SECTION 3.06      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                  (a)      Ownership/No Claims. Each Loan Party owns, or is
licensed to use, all Intellectual Property necessary for or useful in the
conduct of its business as currently conducted, except for those the failure of
which to own or license, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.06(a), no material claim has been asserted and is pending by any
person challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual Property or
the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor does any
Loan Party know of any valid basis for any such claim. The use of such
Intellectual Property by each Loan Party does not infringe the rights of any
person, except for such claims and infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (b)      Registrations. Except pursuant to licenses and other
user agreements entered into by each Loan Party in the ordinary course of
business that are listed in Schedules 13(a) and 13(b) to the Perfection
Certificate, on and as of the date hereof (i) each Loan Party owns and possesses
the right to use, and has done nothing to authorize or enable any other person
to use, any Copyright, Patent or Trademark (as such terms are defined in the
Security Agreement) listed in Schedules 13(a) and 13(b) to the Perfection
Certificate or any other Intellectual Property used or useful in the conduct of
its business as presently conducted and (ii) all registrations listed in
Schedules 13(a) and 13(b) to the Perfection Certificate are valid and in full
force and effect.

                  (c)      No Violations or Proceedings. To each Loan Party's
knowledge, on and as of the date hereof, except as set forth on Schedule
3.06(c), (i) there is no material violation by others of any right of such Loan
Party with respect to any Copyright, Patent or Trademark listed in Schedules
13(a) and 13(b) to the Perfection Certificate or any other Intellectual Property
pledged by it under the name of such Loan Party, (ii) such Loan Party is not
infringing upon, misappropriating or violating any Copyright, Patent, Trademark
or other Intellectual Property of any person other than such infringement,
misappropriation or violation that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the value or utility of
the Intellectual Property or any portion thereof material to the use and
operation of the Collateral, and (iii) no proceedings have been instituted or
are pending against such Loan Party or threatened, and no claim against such
Loan Party has been received by such Loan Party, alleging any such violation,
except as may be set forth in Schedule 3.06(c).

                  SECTION 3.07      EQUITY INTERESTS AND SUBSIDIARIES. (a)
Schedule 3.07(a) sets forth a list of (i) all the Subsidiaries of Borrower
(other than immaterial or inactive Subsidiaries designated in paragraph (d)
below) and their jurisdiction of organization as of the Closing Date and (ii)
the number of each class of its Equity Interests authorized, and the number
outstanding, on the Closing Date and the number of shares covered by all
outstanding options, warrants, rights of conversion or purchase and similar
rights at the Closing Date. All Equity Interests of each Company are duly and
validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and, other than the Equity
Interests of Borrower or as set forth on Schedule 3.07(a), are owned by
Borrower, directly or indirectly through Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. Each Loan
Party is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good and marketable title
to, the Equity Interests pledged by it under the Security Agreement, free of any
and all Liens, rights or claims of other

                                      -63-

<PAGE>

persons, except the security interest created by the Security Agreement, and
there are no outstanding warrants, options or other rights to purchase, or
shareholder, voting trust or similar agreements outstanding with respect to, or
property that is convertible into, or that requires the issuance or sale of, any
such Equity Interests.

                  (b)      No consent of any person including any other general
or limited partner, any other member of a limited liability company, any other
shareholder or any other trust beneficiary is necessary or reasonably desirable
(from the perspective of a secured party) in connection with the creation,
perfection or first priority status of the security interest of the Collateral
Agent in any Equity Interests pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of
the Secured Parties under the Security Agreement or other Security Documents or
the exercise by the Collateral Agent of the voting or other rights provided for
in the Security Agreement or other Security Documents or the exercise of
remedies in respect thereof.

                  (c)      An accurate organization chart, showing the ownership
structure of Borrower and each Subsidiary on the Closing Date, and after giving
effect to the Transactions, is set forth on Schedule 3.07(c).

                  (d)      Schedule 3.07(d) sets forth a list of (i) all
immaterial or inactive Subsidiaries of Borrower (collectively, the "IMMATERIAL
SUBSIDIARIES") and their jurisdiction of organization as of the Closing Date and
(ii) the number of each class of its Equity Interests authorized, and the number
outstanding, on the Closing Date and the number of shares covered by all
outstanding options, warrants, rights of conversion or purchase and similar
rights at the Closing Date. None of the Immaterial Subsidiaries has any assets
with a fair market value exceeding $100,000 in the aggregate or any ongoing
business operations or other activities and each will be dissolved by Borrower
or an applicable Subsidiary Guarantor as provided in Section 5.14.

                  SECTION 3.08      LITIGATION; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. (a)
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.08(a), there are no actions, suits or
proceedings at law or in equity by or before any Governmental Authority or in
any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution proceeding now pending
or, to the knowledge of any Company, threatened against or affecting any Company
or any business, property or rights of any Company (i) that involve any Loan
Document or any of the Transactions or (ii) as to which there is a reasonable
likelihood of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      Except for matters covered by Section 3.18, no
Company or any of its property is in violation of, nor will the continued
operation of its property as currently conducted violate, any Requirements of
Law (including any zoning or building ordinance, code or approval or any
building permits) or any restrictions of record or agreements affecting any
Company's Real Property or is in default with respect to any judgment, writ,
injunction, decree, rule or order of any Governmental Authority, where such
violation or default, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.09      AGREEMENTS. (a) No Company is a party
to (and there are no assets of any Company that are subject to) any agreement or
instrument or subject to any corporate or other constitutional restriction that
has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                                      -64-

<PAGE>

                  (b)      No Company is in default in any manner under any
provision of any indenture or other agreement or instrument evidencing
Indebtedness, or any other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by
which it or any of its property is or may be bound, where such default could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and no condition
exists which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default.

                  (c)      Schedule 3.09(c) accurately and completely lists all
material agreements (other than leases of Real Property set forth on Schedule
3.05(b)) to which any Company is a party which are in effect on the date hereof
in connection with the operation of the business conducted thereby and Borrower
has delivered to the Administrative Agent complete and correct copies of all
such material agreements, including any amendments, supplements or modifications
with respect thereto, and all such agreements are in full force and effect.

                  SECTION 3.10      FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS. (a) No
Company is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of buying or carrying Margin Stock.

                  (b)      No part of the proceeds of any Loan or any Letter of
Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately,
incidentally or ultimately, for any purpose that entails a violation of, or that
is inconsistent with, the provisions of the regulations of the Board, including
Regulation T, U or X. The pledge of the Securities Collateral pursuant to the
Security Agreement does not violate such regulations.

                  SECTION 3.11      INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT. No Company is (a) an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company," as defined in, or subject to regulation
under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (b) a "holding
company," an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company," as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

                  SECTION 3.12      USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower will use the
proceeds of (a) the Term Loans to effect the Acquisition and the Refinancing and
pay related fees and expenses and (b) the revolving extensions of credit after
the Closing Date for general corporate purposes (including to make payments with
respect to the Acquisition and to effect Permitted Acquisitions), it being
understood that no Revolving Loans shall be made on the Closing Date (except to
the extent of replacement letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $60
million and otherwise on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent).

                  SECTION 3.13      TAXES. Each Company has (a) timely
filed or caused to be timely filed all federal Tax Returns and all material
state, local and foreign Tax Returns or materials required to have been filed by
it and all such Tax Returns are true and correct in all material respects except
where the failure to so file or cause to be so filed, or the failure of such Tax
Returns to be true and correct, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (b) duly and timely paid or caused to be duly and timely paid all Taxes
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return) due and payable by it and all
assessments received by it, except (i) Taxes that are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which such Company has set aside on its
books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP or (ii) where the failure to so
pay or cause to be so paid would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Company has made adequate provision in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes not
yet due and payable. Each Company is unaware of any proposed or pending tax
assessments, deficiencies or audits that could be

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

reasonably expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Borrower, except for the Transactions, no
Company has ever been a party to any understanding or arrangement constituting a
"tax shelter" within the meaning of Section 6111(c), Section 6111(d) or Section
6662(d)(2)(C)(iii) of the Code, or has ever "participated" in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4, except
as could not be reasonably expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.14      NO MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS. No information,
report, financial statement, certificate, Borrowing Request, LC Request, exhibit
or schedule furnished by or on behalf of any Company to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of any Loan Document or
included therein or delivered pursuant thereto (including the Confidential
Information Memorandum), taken as a whole, contained or contains any material
misstatement of fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were or are made, not misleading as of the date such information is dated or
certified; provided that to the extent any such information, report, financial
statement, exhibit or schedule was based upon or constitutes a forecast or
projection, each Company represents only that it acted in good faith and
utilized reasonable assumptions and due care in the preparation of such
information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule.

                  SECTION 3.15      LABOR MATTERS. As of the Closing Date,
there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against any Company pending or, to
the knowledge of any Company, threatened and after the Closing Date, there are
no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against any Company pending or, to the
knowledge of any Company, threatened which could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The hours worked by and payments made to
employees of any Company have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards
Act or any other applicable federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with
such matters in any manner which could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. All payments due from any Company, or for which any
claim may be made against any Company, on account of wages and employee health
and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a
liability on the books of such Company except where the failure to do so could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination
or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective
bargaining agreement to which any Company is bound.

                  SECTION 3.16      SOLVENCY. Immediately after the
consummation of the Transactions to occur on the Closing Date and immediately
following the making of each Loan and after giving effect to the application of
the proceeds of each Loan, (a) the fair value of the assets of each Loan Party
(individually and on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) will exceed its
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair
saleable value of the assets of each Loan Party (individually and on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) will be greater than the amount that
will be required to pay the probable liability of its liabilities as such
liabilities become due and payable; (c) each Loan Party (individually and on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) will be able to pay its debts and
liabilities as such debts and liabilities become due and payable; and (d) each
Loan Party (individually and on a consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries) will
not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which
it is engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted
following the Closing Date.

                  SECTION 3.17      EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Each Company and
its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events, could reasonably be expected to result in material liability of any
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or the imposition of a Lien on any of the
property of any Company. The present value of all accumulated benefit
obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the actuarial assumptions and
methods utilized under Section 4001(A)(18) of ERISA) did not, as of the date of
the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $6.5 million the fair market value of the property of all such underfunded
Plans. Using actuarial assumptions and computation methods consistent with
subpart I of subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, the aggregate liabilities of each
Company or its ERISA Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans in the event of a
complete withdrawal therefrom, as of the close of the most recent fiscal year of
each such Multiemployer Plan, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      To the extent applicable, each Foreign Plan has been
maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements of
any and all applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has
been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities. No Company has incurred any material obligation in connection with
the termination of or withdrawal from any Foreign Plan. The present value of the
accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign Plan
which is funded, determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year
of the respective Company on the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of which
is reasonable, did not exceed the current value of the property of such Foreign
Plan, and for each Foreign Plan which is not funded, the obligations of such
Foreign Plan are properly accrued.

                  SECTION 3.18      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (a) Except as
set forth in Schedule 3.18 and except as, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect:

                  irrevocable commitment to issue a policy) of title insurance
                  insuring (or irrevocably committing to insure) the Lien of
                  such Mortgage as a valid first mortgage Lien on the Mortgaged
                  Property and fixtures described therein in the amount equal to
                  not less than 100% of the fair market value of such Mortgaged
                  Property (to the extent a tie-in endorsement is available with
                  respect to such Mortgaged Property and 115% in all other
                  cases) and fixtures as reasonably determined by the Collateral
                  Agent, which fair market value is set forth on Schedule

                  extent necessary, include such co-insurance and/or reinsurance
                  arrangements (with provisions for direct access, if necessary)
                  as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent, (C)
                  contain a "tie-in" or "cluster" endorsement, if available
                  under applicable law (i.e., policies which insure against
                  losses regardless of location or allocated value of the
                  insured property up to a stated maximum coverage amount), (D)
                  have been supplemented by such endorsements as shall be
                  reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent (including
                  endorsements on matters relating to usury, first loss, last
                  dollar, zoning, contiguity, revolving credit, doing business,
                  non-imputation, public road access, survey, variable rate,
                  environmental lien and so-called comprehensive coverage over

                  event a zoning endorsement is not available or is not
                  available at commercially reasonable rates, the Collateral
                  Agent shall have received a zoning report in form and
                  substance reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent from
                  The Planning and Zoning Resource Corporation with respect to
                  such Mortgaged Property), and (E) contain no exceptions to

                  than Permitted Collateral Liens and such other exceptions
                  reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent;

                           (iv)     with respect to each Mortgaged Property
                  located in the United States of America, such affidavits,
                  certificates, information (including financial data) and
                  instruments of indemnification (including a so-called "gap"
                  indemnification) as shall be required to induce the Title
                  Company to issue the Title Policy/ies (or commitment) and
                  endorsements contemplated above;

                           (v)      evidence reasonably acceptable to the
                  Collateral Agent of payment by Borrower of all Title Policy
                  premiums, search and examination charges, and related charges,
                  mortgage recording taxes, fees, charges, costs and expenses
                  required for the recording of the Mortgages, the filing of the
                  fixture filings, if applicable, and issuance of the Title
                  Policies referred to above;

                           (vi)     with respect to each Real Property or
                  Mortgaged Property, copies of all Leases in which Borrower or
                  any Subsidiary holds the lessor's interest or other agreements
                  relating to possessory interests, if any. To the extent any of
                  the foregoing affect any Mortgaged Property, such agreement
                  shall be subordinate to the Lien of the Mortgage to be
                  recorded against such Mortgaged Property, either expressly by
                  its terms or pursuant to a subordination, non-disturbance and
                  attornment agreement in form and substance reasonably
                  acceptable to the Collateral Agent, and shall otherwise be
                  reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent;

                           (vii)    with respect to each Mortgaged Property,
                  each Company shall have made all notifications, registrations
                  and filings, to the extent required by, and in accordance
                  with, all Governmental Real Property Disclosure Requirements
                  applicable to such Mortgaged Property; and

                           (viii)   Surveys with respect to each Mortgaged
                  Property.

                  (q)      Insurance. The Administrative Agent shall have
         received a copy of, or a certificate as to coverage under, the
         insurance policies required by Section 5.04 and the applicable
         provisions of the Security Documents, each of which shall be endorsed
         or otherwise amended to include a "standard" or "New York" lender's
         loss payable or mortgagee endorsement (as applicable) and shall name
         the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, as additional
         insured, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent.

                  SECTION 4.02      CONDITIONS TO ALL CREDIT EXTENSIONS.
The obligation of each Lender and each Issuing Bank to make any Credit Extension
(including the initial Credit Extension) shall be subject to, and to the
satisfaction of, each of the conditions precedent set forth below.

                  (a)      Notice. The Administrative Agent shall have received
         a Borrowing Request as required by Section 2.03 (or such notice shall
         have been deemed given in accordance with Section 2.03) if Loans are
         being requested or, in the case of the issuance, amendment, extension
         or renewal of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank and the
         Administrative Agent shall have received a notice requesting the
         issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of such Letter of Credit as
         required by Section 2.18(b) or, in the case of the Borrowing of a
         Swingline Loan, the

         Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent shall have received a
         Borrowing Request as required by Section 2.17(b).

                  (b)      No Default. Borrower and each other Loan Party shall
         be in compliance in all material respects with all the terms and
         provisions set forth herein and in each other Loan Document on its part
         to be observed or performed, and, at the time of and immediately after
         giving effect to such Credit Extension and the application of the
         proceeds thereof, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on
         such date.

                  (c)      Representations and Warranties. Each of the
         representations and warranties made by any Loan Party set forth in
         Article III hereof or in any other Loan Document shall be true and
         correct in all material respects (except that any representation and
         warranty that is qualified as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse
         Effect" shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the
         date of such Credit Extension with the same effect as though made on
         and as of such date, except to the extent such representations and
         warranties expressly relate to an earlier date.

                  (d)      No Legal Bar. No order, judgment or decree of any
         Governmental Authority shall purport to restrain any Lender from making
         any Loans to be made by it. No injunction or other restraining order
         shall have been issued shall be pending or noticed with respect to any
         action, suit or proceeding seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent the
         consummation of, or to recover any damages or obtain relief as a result
         of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the making of
         Loans hereunder.

                  Each of the delivery of a Borrowing Request or notice
requesting the issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit
and the acceptance by Borrower of the proceeds of such Credit Extension shall
constitute a representation and warranty by Borrower and each other Loan Party
that on the date of such Credit Extension (both immediately before and after
giving effect to such Credit Extension and the application of the proceeds
thereof) the conditions contained in this Section 4.02 have been satisfied.
Borrower shall provide such information (including calculations in reasonable
detail of the covenants in Section 6.10) as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request to confirm that the conditions in this Section 4.02 have been
satisfied.

         Collateral or (ii) the occurrence of any other event which could
         materially affect the value of the Collateral.

                  SECTION 5.03      EXISTENCE; BUSINESSES AND PROPERTIES.
(a) Do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and maintain
in full force and effect its legal existence, except as otherwise expressly
permitted under Section 6.05 or Section 6.06 or, in the case of any Subsidiary,

                  SECTION 5.04      INSURANCE. (a) Keep its insurable
property adequately insured at all times by financially sound and reputable

the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent); provided that with respect
to physical hazard insurance, neither the Collateral Agent nor the applicable
Company shall agree to the adjustment of any claim thereunder without the

Event of Default.

                  (b)      All such insurance shall (i) provide that no
cancellation, material reduction in amount or material change in coverage
thereof shall be effective until at least 30 days after receipt by the

Section 5.04 is taken out by any Company; and promptly deliver to the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent a duplicate original copy of such
policy or policies.

                  (d)      With respect to each Mortgaged Property, obtain flood
insurance in such total amount as the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders may from time to time require, if at any time the area in which any
improvements located on any Mortgaged Property is designated a "flood hazard
area" in any Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (or any successor agency), and otherwise comply with the
National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Flood Disaster Protection

and such supplemental reports with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent
or the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request.

                  (f)      No Loan Party that is an owner of Mortgaged Property
shall take any action that is reasonably likely to be the basis for termination,
revocation or denial of any insurance coverage required to be maintained under
such Loan Party's respective Mortgage or that could be the basis for a defense
to any claim under any Insurance Policy maintained in respect of the Premises,
and each Loan Party shall otherwise comply in all material respects with all
Insurance Requirements in respect of each Premises; provided, however, that each
Loan Party may, at its own expense and after written notice to the
Administrative Agent, (i) contest the applicability or enforceability of any
such Insurance Requirements by appropriate legal proceedings, the prosecution of
which does not constitute a basis for cancellation or revocation of any
insurance coverage required under this Section 5.04 or (ii) cause the Insurance
Policy containing any such Insurance Requirement to be replaced by a new policy
complying with the provisions of this Section 5.04.

                  (g)      Unless Borrower provides evidence of the insurance
coverage required hereunder, Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent may
purchase insurance at the expense of the

                                      -81-

<PAGE>

applicable Subsidiary to protect the Secured Parties' interest in the Mortgaged
Property located in Missouri. This insurance may, but need not protect the
interest of such Subsidiary Guarantor. The coverage that Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent purchases may not pay any claim that such Subsidiary Guarantor
makes or claim that is made against such Subsidiary Guarantor in connection with
such Mortgaged Property. The applicable Subsidiary Guarantor may later cancel
any insurance purchased by Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, but only
after providing evidence that such Subsidiary Guarantor has obtained insurance
as required by this Credit Agreement. If Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent purchases insurance for such Mortgaged Property, the applicable Subsidiary
Guarantor will be responsible for the costs of that insurance, including the
insurance premium interest and any other charges Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent may impose in connection with the placement of the insurance,
until the effective date of the cancellation or expiration of the insurance. The
costs of the insurance may be added to the Indebtedness. The costs of the
insurance may be more than the cost of insurance the applicable Subsidiary
Guarantor may be able to obtain on its own.

                  SECTION 5.05      OBLIGATIONS AND TAXES. (a) Pay its
Indebtedness and other obligations promptly and in accordance with their terms
and pay and discharge promptly when due all Taxes, assessments and governmental
charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or in respect of
its property, before the same shall become delinquent or in default, as well as
all lawful claims for labor, services, materials and supplies or otherwise that,
if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien other than a Permitted Lien upon such
properties or any part thereof; provided that such payment and discharge shall
not be required with respect to any such Tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim
so long as (i) the validity or amount thereof shall be contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings timely instituted and diligently conducted and the
applicable Company shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves or other
appropriate provisions with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP, (ii) such
contest operates to suspend collection of the contested obligation, Tax,
assessment or charge and enforcement of a Lien other than a Permitted Lien and
(iii) in the case of Collateral, the applicable Company shall have otherwise
complied with the Contested Collateral Lien Conditions.

                  (b)      Timely and correctly file all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by it.

                  SECTION 5.06      EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) Comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and (b)
furnish to the Administrative Agent (x) as soon as possible after, and in any
event within 5 days after any Responsible Officer of any Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of any Company knows or has reason to know that, any ERISA Event has
occurred that, alone or together with any other ERISA Event could reasonably be
expected to result in liability of the Companies or any of their ERISA
Affiliates in an aggregate amount exceeding $500,000 or the imposition of a
Lien, a statement of a Financial Officer of Borrower setting forth details as to
such ERISA Event and the action, if any, that the Companies propose to take with
respect thereto, and (y) upon 10 days of becoming available to any Company,
copies of (i) each Schedule B (Actuarial Information) to the annual report (Form
5500 Series) filed by any Company or any ERISA Affiliate with the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to each Plan; (ii) the most recent actuarial
valuation report for each Plan; (iii) all notices received by any Company or any
ERISA Affiliate from a Multiemployer Plan sponsor or any governmental agency
concerning an ERISA Event; (iv) all non-routine correspondence with any
government agency with respect to any Plan or employee benefit plan sponsored or
contributed to by any Company; and (v) such other documents or governmental
reports or filings relating to any Plan (or employee benefit plan sponsored or
contributed to by any Company) as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
request.

                  SECTION 5.07      MAINTAINING RECORDS; ACCESS TO PROPERTIES
AND INSPECTIONS; ANNUAL MEETINGS. (a) Keep proper books of record and account in
which full, true and correct entries in conformity with GAAP and all
Requirements of Law are made of all dealings and transactions in relation to its
business and activities. Each Company will permit any representatives designated
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to visit and inspect the financial
records and the property of such Company at reasonable times and as often as
reasonably requested and to make extracts from and copies of such financial
records, and permit any representatives designated by the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to discuss the affairs, finances, accounts and condition of any
Company with the officers and employees thereof and advisors therefor (including
independent accountants).

                  (b)      Within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year,
at the request of the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders, hold a meeting
(at a mutually agreeable location and time or, at the option of the
Administrative Agent, by conference call) with all Lenders who choose to attend
such meeting at which meeting shall be reviewed the financial results of the
previous fiscal year and the financial condition of the Companies and the
budgets presented for the current fiscal year of the Companies.

                  SECTION 5.08      USE OF PROCEEDS. Use the proceeds of
the Loans and request the issuance of Letters of Credit only for the purposes
set forth in Section 3.12.

                  SECTION 5.09      COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS;
ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. (a) Comply, and use all reasonable efforts to cause all
lessees and other persons occupying Real Property owned or leased by any Company
to comply, in all material respects with all Environmental Laws and
Environmental Permits applicable to its operations and Real Property; obtain and
renew all material Environmental Permits applicable to its operations and Real
Property; and conduct all Responses required by, and in accordance with,
Environmental Laws; provided that no Company shall be required to undertake any
Response to the extent that its obligation to do so is being contested in good
faith and by proper proceedings and appropriate reserves are being maintained
with respect to such circumstances in accordance with GAAP.

                  (b)      If a Default caused by reason of a breach of Section
3.18 or Section 5.09(a) shall have occurred and be continuing for more than 20
days without the Companies commencing activities reasonably likely to cure such
Default, at the written request of the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders through the Administrative Agent, Borrower shall provide to the Lenders
within 45 days after such request, at the expense of Borrower, an environmental
assessment report regarding the matters which are the subject of such Default,
including, where appropriate, any soil and/or groundwater sampling, prepared by
an environmental consulting firm, and in form and substance, reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and indicating the presence or absence of
Hazardous Materials and the estimated cost of any compliance or Response to
address them.

                  (c)      Each Loan Party that is an owner of Mortgaged
Property shall not, and shall take all reasonable efforts necessary to ensure
that no other person shall, use, store, generate, handle or Release any
Hazardous Material at, in, on, under or upon any Mortgaged Property except in
full compliance with applicable Environmental Law and in a manner that is not
likely to result in the assertion of any material Environmental Claims against
any Company or related to any Mortgaged Property.

                  SECTION 5.10      INTEREST RATE PROTECTION. No later than
the 30th day after the Closing Date, Borrower shall enter into, and throughout
the term of this Agreement maintain, Hedging Agreements with terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent that result in at

least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Borrower's Consolidated
Indebtedness (exclusive of Revolving Loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$20 million and the face amount of all undrawn Letters of Credit) being
effectively subject to a fixed or maximum interest rate reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent.

                  SECTION 5.11      ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL; ADDITIONAL
GUARANTORS. (a) Subject to this Section 5.11, with respect to any property
acquired after the Closing Date by any Loan Party that is intended to be subject

Document in accordance with all applicable Requirements of Law, including the

Agent such documents as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall
require to confirm the validity, perfection and priority of the Lien of the
Security Documents against such after-acquired property.

                  (b)      With respect to any person that is or becomes a
Subsidiary after the Closing Date (other than an Excluded Project Subsidiary),

<PAGE>

Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to take the actions specified in clause
(i)-(iii) of this Section 5.11(b), to the extent that doing so would constitute
an investment of earnings in United States property under Section 956 (or a
successor provision) of the Code, which investment would or could reasonably be
expected to trigger a material increase in the taxable income of a United States
shareholder of such Subsidiary pursuant to Section 951 (or a successor
provision) of the Code, as reasonably determined by Borrower and the
Administrative Agent; provided that this exception shall not apply to (A) Voting
Stock of any Subsidiary which is a first-tier controlled foreign corporation (as

                  (c)      Promptly grant to the Collateral Agent, within 60

Collateral Agent otherwise consents, each leased Real Property of such Loan
Party which lease individually has a fair market value of at least $500,000, in
each case, as additional security for the Obligations (unless the subject
property is already mortgaged to a third party to the extent permitted by
Section 6.02 or is the subject of any Existing Non-Recourse Indebtedness or any
Additional Non-Recourse Indebtedness permitted under Section 6.01). Such
Mortgages shall be granted pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and
shall constitute valid and enforceable perfected Liens subject only to Permitted
Collateral Liens or other Liens acceptable to the Collateral Agent. The
Mortgages or instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed in such
manner and in such places as are required by law to establish, perfect, preserve
and protect the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent required to be granted
pursuant to the Mortgages and all taxes, fees and other charges payable in
connection therewith shall be paid in full. Such Loan Party shall otherwise take
such actions and execute and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents
as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall require to confirm the
validity, perfection and priority of the Lien of any existing Mortgage or new
Mortgage against such after-acquired Real Property (including a Title Policy, a
Survey and local counsel opinion (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent) in respect of such
Mortgage).

interest in and Mortgage on each Real Property listed on Schedule 6.06(c), if

Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and shall constitute valid and
enforceable perfected Liens subject only to Permitted Collateral Liens or other
Liens reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent. The Mortgages or
instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed in such manner and
in such places as are required by law to establish, perfect, preserve and
protect the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent required to be granted
pursuant to the Mortgages and all taxes, fees and other charges payable in
connection therewith shall be paid in full. The applicable Loan Party shall take
such actions and execute and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents
as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall reasonably require to
confirm the validity, perfection and priority of the Lien of the Mortgage
against any such Real Property (including a Title Policy, a Survey and local
counsel opinion (in form and

                                      -85-

substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral

listed on Schedule 5.11(e). Such Mortgages shall be granted pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and shall constitute valid and
enforceable perfected Liens subject only to Permitted Collateral Liens or other
Liens reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent. The Mortgages or
instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed in such manner and
in such places as are required by law to establish, perfect, preserve and
protect the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent required to be granted
pursuant to the Mortgages and all taxes, fees and other charges payable in
connection therewith shall be paid in full. The applicable Loan Party shall take
such actions and execute and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents
as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall reasonably require to
confirm the validity, perfection and priority of the Lien of the Mortgage
against any such Real Property (including a Title Policy, a Survey and local
counsel opinion (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent) in respect of such Mortgage).

                  SECTION 5.12      SECURITY INTERESTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES.
Promptly, upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender, at Borrower's expense, execute, acknowledge and
deliver, or cause the execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter
register, file or record, or cause to be registered, filed or recorded, in an
appropriate governmental office, any document or instrument supplemental to or
confirmatory of the Security Documents or otherwise deemed by the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent reasonably necessary or desirable for the
continued validity, perfection and priority of the Liens on the Collateral
covered thereby subject to no other Liens except as permitted by the applicable
Security Document, or obtain any consents or waivers as may be necessary or
appropriate in connection therewith and shall take such other action as may be
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.
Deliver or cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent from time to time such other documentation, consents, authorizations,
approvals and orders in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent as the Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent shall reasonably deem necessary to perfect or maintain the
Liens on the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents. Upon the exercise by
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender of any power,
right, privilege or remedy pursuant to any Loan Document which requires any
consent, approval, registration, qualification or authorization of any
Governmental Authority execute and deliver all applications, certifications,
instruments and other documents and papers that the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or such Lender may require. If the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders determine that they are required by law
or regulation to have appraisals prepared in respect of the Real Property of any
Loan Party constituting Collateral, Borrower shall provide to the Administrative
Agent appraisals that satisfy the applicable requirements of the Real Estate
Appraisal Reform Amendments of FIRREA and are otherwise in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent.

                  SECTION 5.13      INFORMATION REGARDING COLLATERAL. (a)

Identification Number or organizational identification number, if any, or (v) in
any Loan Party's jurisdiction of organization (in each case, including by

jurisdiction), until (A) it shall have given the Collateral Agent and the
Administrative Agent not less than 30 days' prior written notice (in the form of
an Officers' Certificate), or such lesser notice period agreed to by the
Collateral Agent, clearly describing such change and providing such other
information in connection therewith as the Collateral Agent or the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (B) it shall have taken all
action reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent to maintain the
perfection and priority of the security interest of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties in the Collateral, if applicable. Each Loan Party
agrees to promptly provide the Collateral Agent with certified Organizational
Documents reflecting any of the changes described in the preceding sentences.
Each Loan Party also agrees to promptly notify the Collateral Agent of any
change in the location of any office in which it maintains books or records
relating to Collateral owned by it or any office or facility at which Collateral
is located (including the establishment of any such new office or facility),
other than changes in the location of such Collateral to a Mortgaged Property or
a leased property subject to a Landlord Access Agreement.

                  (b)      Concurrently with the delivery of financial
statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a), deliver to the Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent a Perfection Certificate Supplement and a certificate of a
Financial Officer and the chief legal officer of Borrower certifying that all
UCC financing statements (including fixture filings, as applicable) or other
appropriate filings, recordings or registrations, including all refilings,
rerecordings and reregistrations, containing a description of the Collateral
have been filed of record in each governmental, municipal or other appropriate
office in each jurisdiction necessary to protect and perfect the security
interests and Liens under the Security Documents for a period of not less than
18 months after the date of such certificate (except as noted therein with
respect to any continuation statements to be filed within such period).

                  SECTION 5.14      DISSOLUTION OF IMMATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES.
Unless such Immaterial Subsidiary shall have previously executed a Joinder
Agreement or such comparable documentation to become a Subsidiary Guarantor and
a joinder agreement to the applicable Security Agreement, substantially in the
form annexed thereto, and taken all other actions necessary or advisable in the
opinion of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to become a
Subsidiary Guarantor, on or before June 30, 2004, Borrower or the applicable
Subsidiary Guarantor shall dissolve in accordance with applicable law (and
thereafter cease any and all operations in respect of) each Immaterial
Subsidiary and shall provide satisfactory evidence thereof to the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent.

                  SECTION 5.15      LETTERS OF CREDIT TO BE COLLATERALIZED.
On or before March 31, 2004, Borrower shall have replaced or supported each
letter of credit set forth on Schedule 5.15 with a corresponding Letter of
Credit issued pursuant to the terms of Section 2.18 on terms and conditions
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank.

                  SECTION 5.16      CERTAIN POST-CLOSING MATTERS.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other Loan
Document, Borrower shall not be required to deliver on the Closing Date those
items set forth on Schedule 5.16; provided that, as promptly as practicable
thereafter, and in any event on or before the date specified therein, Borrower
shall be required to deliver or cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent
all such items in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent.

         taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies, which (i) are
         being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for which
         adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP, which
         proceedings (or orders entered in connection with such proceedings)
         have the effect of preventing the forfeiture or sale of the property
         subject to any such Lien, or (ii) in the case of any such charge or

         materially detract from the value of the property of the Companies,
         taken as a whole, and do not materially impair the use thereof in the
         operation of the business of the Companies, taken as a whole, (ii)
         which, if they secure obligations that are then due and unpaid, are

         have the effect of preventing the forfeiture or sale of the property
         subject to any such Lien, and (iii) in the case of any such Lien which
         has or may become a Lien against any of the Collateral, such Lien and
         the contest thereof shall satisfy the Contested Collateral Lien

         in) an Excluded Project Subsidiary that is either not a Loan Party as
         of the Closing Date or becomes a Subsidiary after the Closing Date, but
         only to the extent that such Liens secure Additional Non-Recourse
         Indebtedness that is permitted by Section 6.01(h);

                  (e)      easements, rights-of-way, restrictions (including

         in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or proceedings for review in
         respect of which there shall be secured a subsisting stay of execution
         pending such appeal or proceedings and, in the case of any such Lien
         which has or may become a Lien against any of the Collateral, such Lien
         and the contest thereof shall satisfy the Contested Collateral Lien
         Conditions;

         imposed by law or deposits made in connection therewith in the ordinary
         course of business in connection with workers' compensation,
         unemployment insurance and other types of social security legislation,

         amounts are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
         for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with
         GAAP, which proceedings for orders entered in connection with such
         proceedings have the effect of preventing the forfeiture or sale of the
         property subject to any such Lien, (ii) to the extent such Liens are
         not imposed by law, such Liens shall in no event encumber any property
         other than cash and Cash Equivalents, (iii) in the case of any such
         Lien against any of the Collateral, such Lien and the contest thereof
         shall satisfy the Contested Collateral Lien Conditions and (iv) the
         aggregate amount of deposits at any time pursuant to clause (y) and
         clause (z) of this paragraph (g) shall not exceed $250,000 in the
         aggregate;

                  (h)      Leases of the properties of any Company, in each case
         entered into in the ordinary course of such Company's business so long
         as such Leases are subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted and
         evidenced by the Security Documents and do not, individually or in the
         aggregate, (i) interfere in any material respect with the ordinary
         conduct of the business of any Company or (ii) materially impair the
         use (for its intended purposes) or the value of the property subject
         thereto;

                  (l)      Liens on property of a person existing at the time
         such person is acquired or merged with or into or consolidated with any
         Company to the extent permitted hereunder (and not created in
         anticipation or contemplation thereof); provided that such Liens do not
         extend to property not subject to such Liens at the time of acquisition
         (other than improvements thereon) and are not more favorable to the
         lienholders than such existing Lien;

         long as such issuance is not prohibited by Section 6.13 or any other
         provision of this Agreement, and may amend its Organizational Documents
         to authorize any such Equity Interests.

another obligation, except the following: (i) this Agreement and the other Loan

funds or properties of the Loan Parties that are used to repay the Loans to

or any ongoing business operations or other activities.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                   GUARANTEE

                  SECTION  7.01 THE GUARANTEE. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby,
jointly and severally guarantee, each as a primary obligor and not merely as a
surety, to each Secured Party and their respective successors and assigns, the
prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by required
prepayment, declaration, demand, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal
of and interest (including any interest, fees, costs or charges that would
accrue but for the provisions of the Title 11 of the United States Code after
any bankruptcy or insolvency petition under Title 11 of the United States Code)
on the Loans made by the Lenders to, and the Notes held by each Lender of,
Borrower, and the prompt payment and performance of all other Obligations from
time to time owing to the Secured Parties by any Loan Party under any Loan
Document in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof (such
obligations being herein collectively called the "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS"). The
Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that if Borrower or
other Guarantor(s) shall fail to pay and perform in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the Subsidiary Guarantors will promptly pay the same in cash and/or
perform the same, as the case may be, without any demand or notice whatsoever,
and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due
(whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with
the terms of such extension or renewal.

                  SECTION  7.02 OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of
the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 7.01 shall constitute a guaranty of
payment and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, are absolute,
irrevocable and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value,
genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or any other
agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution,
release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or Guarantor (except for payment in full or release by the Collateral
Agent in accordance with the terms of the applicable Loan Documents). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of
any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the
Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder which shall remain absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional under any and all circumstances as described above:

                  (i)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         the Subsidiary Guarantors, the time for any performance of or
         compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or
         such performance or compliance shall be waived;

                  (ii)     any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or
         instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted;

                                     -102-

<PAGE>

                  (iii)    the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
         shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
         amended in any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents or any
         other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be
         amended or waived in any respect or any other guarantee of any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or
         exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (iv)     any Lien or security interest granted to, or in favor
         of, Issuing Bank or any Lender or Agent as security for any of the
         Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected; or

                  (v)      the release of any other Guarantor pursuant to
         Section 7.09.

                  Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any
requirement that any Secured Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed
against Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other
agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or against any other
person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed
Obligations. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any and all notice of the
creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured Party
upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, and the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created,
contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Guarantee, and all dealings between
Borrower and the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have
been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall be
construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of
payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations at any time or from time to time held by Secured Parties, and the
obligations and liabilities of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall not be
conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other
person at any time of any right or remedy against Borrower or against any other
person which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor
or right of offset with respect thereto. This Guarantee shall remain in full
force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its
terms upon the Subsidiary Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and
shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders, and their respective successors and
assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this
Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby expressly waives
any and all suretyship defenses to which it might otherwise be entitled.

                  SECTION  7.03 REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantors under this Article VII shall be automatically reinstated if and to
the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of Borrower or other
Loan Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether
as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise.

                  SECTION  7.04 SUBROGATION; RIGHTS OF REIMBURSEMENT;
SUBORDINATION Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that until the
indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Guaranteed
Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of the Lenders
under this Agreement it shall waive any claim and shall not exercise any right
or remedy, direct or indirect, arising by reason of any performance by it of its
guarantee in Section 7.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against Borrower
or any other Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for
any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                                     -103-

<PAGE>

                  (b)      If any payment is made by a Subsidiary Guarantor or
from its property, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled, subject to and
upon payment in full of the Obligations, (i) to demand and enforce reimbursement
for the full amount of such payment from Borrower and (ii) to demand and enforce
contribution in respect of such payment from each other Subsidiary Guarantor
that has not paid its fair share of such payment, as necessary to ensure that
(after giving effect to any enforcement of reimbursement rights provided hereby)
each Subsidiary Guarantor pays its fair share of the unreimbursed portion of
such payment. For this purpose, the "fair share" of each Subsidiary Guarantor as
to any unreimbursed payment shall be determined based on an equitable
apportionment of such unreimbursed payment among all Subsidiary Guarantors based
on the relative value of their assets and any other equitable considerations
deemed appropriate by a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  (c)      If and whenever (after payment in full of the
Obligations and delivery of notification thereof to the Collateral Agent) any
right of reimbursement or contribution becomes enforceable by any Subsidiary
Guarantor against any other Subsidiary Guarantor under Section 7.04(b), such
Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled, subject to and upon payment in full of
the Obligations, to be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Subsidiary
Guarantors entitled to reimbursement or contribution from any other Subsidiary
Guarantor as set forth in this Section 7.04) to any security interest that may
then be held by the Collateral Agent upon any Collateral granted to it under the
Security Documents. Such right of subrogation shall be enforceable solely
against the Subsidiary Guarantors, and not against the Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party, and neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Secured
Party shall have any duty whatsoever to warrant, ensure or protect any such
right of subrogation or to obtain, perfect, maintain, hold, enforce or retain
any Collateral for any purpose related to any such right of subrogation. If
subrogation is demanded by any Subsidiary Guarantor, then (after payment in full
in cash of the Obligations, the termination of all Commitments and the discharge
or cash collateralization (at 100% of the aggregate undrawn amount) of all
outstanding Letters of Credit) the Collateral Agent shall deliver to the
Subsidiary Guarantors making such demand, or to a representative of such
Subsidiary Guarantors or of the Subsidiary Guarantors generally, an instrument
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent transferring, on a quitclaim
basis without any recourse, representation, warranty or obligation whatsoever,
whatever security interest the Collateral Agent then may hold in whatever
Collateral may then exist that was not previously released or disposed of by the
Collateral Agent (provided that such Subsidiary Guarantors shall prepare and
deliver the initial draft of such instrument to the Collateral Agent).

                  (d)      Any Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor
permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(d) and all rights and claims arising under
this Section 7.04 or based upon or relating to any other right of reimbursement,
indemnification, contribution or subrogation that may at any time arise or exist
in favor of any Subsidiary Guarantor as to any payment on account of the
Obligations made by it or received or collected from its property shall be fully
subordinated in all respects to the prior payment in full in cash of all of the
Obligations, the termination of all Commitments and the discharge or cash
collateralization (at 100% of the aggregate undrawn amount) of all outstanding
Letters of Credit and, with respect to any indebtedness permitted pursuant to
Section 6.01(d), otherwise in the manner set forth in the Intercompany Note
evidencing such Indebtedness. Until payment in full in cash of the Obligations,
the termination of all Commitments and the discharge or cash collateralization
(at 100% of the aggregate undrawn amount) of all outstanding Letters of Credit,
no Subsidiary Guarantor shall demand or receive any collateral security or, upon
and during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, any payment or
distribution whatsoever (whether in cash, property or securities or otherwise)
on account of any such right or claim. If any such payment or distribution is
made or becomes available to any Subsidiary Guarantor in any bankruptcy case or
receivership, insolvency or liquidation proceeding, such payment or

                                     -104-

<PAGE>

distribution shall be delivered by the person making such payment or
distribution directly to the Collateral Agent, for application to the payment of
the Obligations. If any such payment or distribution is received by any
Subsidiary Guarantor, it shall be held by such Subsidiary Guarantor in trust, as
trustee of an express trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and shall
forthwith be transferred and delivered by such Subsidiary Guarantor to the
Collateral Agent, in the exact form received and, if necessary, duly endorsed.

                  (e)      The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under
the Loan Documents, including their liability for the Obligations and the
enforceability of the security interests granted thereby, are not contingent
upon the validity, legality, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of
any right of reimbursement, contribution or subrogation arising under this
Section 7.04. The invalidity, insufficiency, unenforceability or
uncollectibility of any such right shall not in any respect diminish, affect or
impair any such obligation or any other claim, interest, right or remedy at any
time held by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party against any
Subsidiary Guarantor or its property. The Secured Parties make no
representations or warranties in respect of any such right and shall have no
duty to assure, protect, enforce or ensure any such right or otherwise relating
to any such right.

                  (f)      Each Subsidiary Guarantor reserves any and all other
rights of reimbursement, contribution or subrogation at any time available to it
as against any other Subsidiary Guarantor, but (i) the exercise and enforcement
of such rights shall be subject to Section 7.04(d) and (ii) neither the
Collateral Agent nor any other Secured Party shall at any time have any duty or
liability whatsoever in respect of any such right, except as provided in Section
7.04(c).

                  SECTION  7.05 REMEDIES. The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and
severally agree that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Lenders, the
obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, if any, may be
declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall
be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances
provided in said Article VIII) for purposes of Section 7.01, notwithstanding any
stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such
obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against Borrower and
that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have
become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and
payable by Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary
Guarantors for purposes of Section 7.01.

                  SECTION  7.06 INSTRUMENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY. Each
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article VII
constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that
any Lender or Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such
Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to
bring a motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213.

                  SECTION  7.07 CONTINUING GUARANTEE. The guarantee in this
Article VII is a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall apply to all
Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.

                  SECTION  7.08 GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. In
any action or proceeding involving any state corporate limited partnership or
limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of
creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 7.01
would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account
of the amount of its liability under Section 7.01, then, notwithstanding any
other

                                     -105-

<PAGE>

provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any
further action by such Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and
enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined
in such action or proceeding.

                  SECTION  7.09 RELEASE OF GUARANTORS. If, in compliance with
the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, all or substantially all of the
Equity Interests or property of any Subsidiary Guarantor are sold or otherwise
transferred (a "TRANSFERRED GUARANTOR") to a person or persons, none of which is
Borrower or a Subsidiary, such Transferred Guarantor shall, upon the
consummation of such sale or transfer, be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (including under Section 11.03 hereof) and its obligations to
pledge and grant any Collateral owned by it pursuant to any Security Document
and, in the case of a sale of all or substantially all of the Equity Interests
of the Transferred Guarantor, the pledge of such Equity Interests to the
Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents shall be released, and the
Collateral Agent shall take such actions as are necessary to effect each release
described in this Section 7.09 in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Security Documents.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of the following events ("EVENTS

         any Lender, Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent any notice, under
         the provisions of Section 443.055 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri,
         concerning future advances;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to Borrower

the Required Lenders shall, by notice to Borrower, take either or both of the
following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate forthwith the
Commitments and (ii) declare the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations then

waived by Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors, anything contained herein or
in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding; and in any event,
with respect to Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above, the
Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations then outstanding, together with accrued interest

             COLLATERAL ACCOUNT; APPLICATION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS

                  SECTION  9.01 COLLATERAL ACCOUNT. (a) The Collateral Agent is
hereby authorized to establish and maintain at its office at 677 Washington
Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901, in the name of the Collateral Agent and
pursuant to a Control Agreement, a restricted deposit account designated
"Ionics, Incorporated Collateral Account." Each Loan Party shall deposit into
the Collateral Account from time to time (i) the cash proceeds of any of the
Collateral (including pursuant to any disposition thereof) to the extent
contemplated herein or in any other Loan Document, (ii) the cash proceeds of any
Casualty Event with respect to Collateral, to the extent contemplated herein or
in any other Loan Document, and (iii) any cash such Loan Party is required to
pledge as additional collateral security hereunder pursuant to the Loan
Documents.

                  (b)      The balance from time to time in the Collateral
Account shall constitute part of the Collateral and shall not constitute payment
of the Obligations until applied as hereinafter provided. So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or will result therefrom, the Collateral
Agent shall within two Business Days of receiving a request of the applicable
Loan Party for release of cash proceeds (i) from the Collateral Account
constituting Net Cash Proceeds relating to any Casualty Event or Asset Sale,
remit such cash proceeds on deposit in the Collateral Account to or upon the
order of such Loan Party, so long as such Loan Party has satisfied the
conditions relating thereto set forth in Section 9.02 and (ii) with respect to
the LC Sub-Account, remit such Net Cash Proceeds on deposit in the LC
Sub-Account to or upon the order of such Loan Party (x) at such time as all
Letters of Credit shall have been terminated and all of the liabilities in
respect of the Letters of Credit have been paid in full or (y) otherwise in
accordance with Section 2.18(i). At any time following the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may (and, if
instructed by the Required Lenders as specified herein, shall) in its (or their)
discretion apply or cause to be applied (subject to collection) the balance from
time to time outstanding to the credit of the Collateral Account to the payment
of the Obligations in the manner specified in Section 9.03 hereof subject,
however, in the case of amounts deposited in the LC Sub-Account, to the
provisions of Sections 2.18(i) and 9.03. The Loan Parties shall have no right to
withdraw, transfer or otherwise receive any funds deposited in the Collateral
Account except to the extent specifically provided herein.

                  (c)      Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be
invested and reinvested from time to time in Cash Equivalents as the applicable
Loan Party (or, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Collateral Agent) shall determine by written instruction to the
Collateral Agent, or if no such instructions are given, then as the Collateral
Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine, which Cash Equivalents shall be
held in the name and be under the control of the Collateral Agent (or any
sub-agent); provided that at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may (and, if instructed
by the Required Lenders as specified herein, shall) in its (or their) discretion
at any time and from time to time elect to liquidate any such Cash Equivalents
and to apply or cause to be applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the
Obligations in the manner specified in Section 9.03 hereof subject, however, in
the case of amounts deposited in the LC Sub-Account, to the provisions of
Section 2.18(i).

                                     -109-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      Amounts deposited into the Collateral Account as
cover for liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit under any provision of
this Agreement requiring such cover shall be held by the Administrative Agent in
a separate sub-account designated as the "LC Sub-Account" (the "LC SUB-ACCOUNT")
and, subject to Section 2.18(i), all amounts held in the LC Sub-Account shall
constitute collateral security first for the liabilities in respect of Letters
of Credit outstanding from time to time and second for the other Obligations
hereunder until such time as all Letters of Credit shall have been terminated
and all of the liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit have been paid in
full or otherwise in accordance with Section 2.18(i).

                  SECTION  9.02 PROCEEDS OF DESTRUCTION, TAKING AND COLLATERAL
DISPOSITIONS. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in the event the applicable Loan Party elects to reinvest Net Cash
Proceeds in respect of any Asset Sale or Casualty Event in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 2.10(c) and 2.10(e) as applicable, the Collateral Agent
shall receive at least 10 days' prior notice of each request for payment and
shall not release any part of such Net Cash Proceeds, until the applicable Loan
Party has furnished to the Collateral Agent (i) an Officers' Certificate setting
forth: (A) a brief description of the reinvestment to be made, (B) the dollar
amount of the expenditures to be made, or costs incurred by such Loan Party in
connection with such reinvestment and (C) evidence that the properties acquired
in connection with such reinvestment have a fair market value at least equal to
the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds requested to be released from the
Collateral Account and (ii) all security agreements and Mortgages and other
items required by the provisions of Sections 5.11 and 5.12 to, among other
things, subject such reinvestment properties to the Lien of the Security
Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and for the benefit
of the other Secured Parties.

                  SECTION  9.03 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds received
by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or other
realization upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by
the Collateral Agent of its remedies shall be applied, in full or in part,
together with any other sums then held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this
Agreement, promptly by the Collateral Agent as follows:

                  (a)      First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
         expenses, fees, commissions and taxes of such sale, collection or other
         realization, including compensation to the Collateral Agent and its
         agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or
         incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection therewith and all
         amounts for which the Collateral Agent is entitled to indemnification
         pursuant to the provisions of any Loan Document, together with interest
         on each such amount at the highest rate then in effect under this
         Agreement from and after the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid
         until paid in full;

                  (b)      Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs
         and expenses of such sale, collection or other realization including
         compensation to the other Secured Parties and their agents and counsel
         and all costs, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the other
         Secured Parties in connection therewith, together with interest on each
         such amount at the highest rate then in effect under this Agreement
         from and after the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid
         in full;

                  (c)      Third, without duplication of amounts applied
         pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above, to the indefeasible payment in
         full in cash, pro rata, of interest and other amounts constituting
         Obligations (other than principal and Reimbursement Obligations) in
         each case equally and ratably in accordance with the respective amounts
         thereof then due and owing;

                                     -110-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      Fourth, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash,
         pro rata, of the principal amount of the Obligations (including
         Reimbursement Obligations); and

                  (e)      Fifth, the balance, if any, to the person lawfully
         entitled thereto (including the applicable Loan Party or its successors
         or assigns) or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

                  In the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to pay in
full the items described in clauses (a) through (e) of this Section 9.03, the
Loan Parties shall remain liable, jointly and severally, for any deficiency.

                                   ARTICLE X

                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

                  SECTION  10.01 APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby irrevocably
designates and appoints each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent as an agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent, in such capacity,
through its agents or employees, to take such actions on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to such Agent by the
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions
and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  SECTION  10.02 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Each person
serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not an Agent, and such person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.

                  SECTION  10.03 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. No Agent shall have any
duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that such Agent
is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 11.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose or shall be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as such
Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.02) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be
deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof
is given to such Agent by Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii)
the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder
or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any

                                     -111-

<PAGE>

other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition
set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document.

                  SECTION  10.04 RELIANCE BY AGENT. Each Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice,
request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by a proper person.
Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally and believed by it
to be made by a proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying
thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
Borrower), independent accountants and other advisors selected by it, and shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the
advice of any such counsel, accountants or advisors.

                  SECTION  10.05 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Each Agent may perform
any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one
or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent
may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through
their respective Affiliates. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
Sections shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of each Agent
and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as
well as activities as Agent.

                  SECTION  10.06 SUCCESSOR AGENT. Each Agent may resign as such
at any time upon at least 30 days' prior notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
and Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the
right, in consultation with Borrower, to appoint a successor Agent from among
the Lenders. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent, which
successor shall be a commercial banking institution organized under the laws of
the United States (or any State thereof) or a United States branch or agency of
a commercial banking institution, in each case, having combined capital and
surplus of at least $250 million; provided that if such retiring Agent is unable
to find a commercial banking institution which is willing to accept such
appointment and which meets the qualifications set forth above, the retiring
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the
Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until
such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent.

                  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as an Agent hereunder
by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees
payable by Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to
its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor.
After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article X and
Section 11.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent,
its sub-agents and their respective Affiliates in respect of any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.

                  SECTION  10.07 NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each
Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking

                                     -112-

action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                  SECTION  10.08 NAME AGENTS. The parties hereto acknowledge
that the Documentation Agent, the Co-Documentation Agents and the Syndication
Agents hold such titles in name only, and that such titles confer no additional
rights or obligations relative to those conferred on any Lender hereunder.

                  SECTION  10.09 INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders severally agree to
indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
Borrower or the Subsidiary Guarantors and without limiting the obligation of
Borrower or the Subsidiary Guarantors to do so), ratably according to their
respective outstanding Loans and Commitments in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought under this Section 10.09 (or, if indemnification is
sought after the date upon which all Commitments shall have terminated and the
Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall have been paid in full, ratably in
accordance with such outstanding Loans and Commitments as in effect immediately
prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or
after the payment of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of
the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the
date of receipt if delivered by hand or overnight courier service or sent by
telecopy or by certified or registered mail, in each case delivered, sent or
mailed (properly addressed) to such party as provided in this Section 11.01 or
in accordance with the latest unrevoked direction from such party given in
accordance with this Section 11.01, and failure to deliver courtesy copies of
notices and other communications shall in no event affect the validity or
effectiveness of such notices and other communications.

                  SECTION  11.02 WAIVERS; AMENDMENT. (a) No failure or delay by
any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of each Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b)      Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) below,
neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or
thereof may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified except, in the case of
this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document,
pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent (in the

                                     -114-

<PAGE>

case of any Security Document) and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the written consent of the Required Lenders;
provided that no such agreement shall:

                  (i)      increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
         written consent of such Lender;

                  (ii)     reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC
         Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any Fees
         payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
         thereby;

                  (iii)    postpone or extend the maturity of any Loan, or any
         scheduled date of payment of or the installment otherwise due on the
         principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.09, or the required
         date of payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, or any date for the
         payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount
         of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of
         expiration of any Commitment or postpone the scheduled date of
         expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Maturity Date,
         without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby;

                  (iv)     change Section 2.14(b) or (c) in a manner that would
         alter the pro rata sharing of payments or setoffs required thereby,
         without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby;

                  (v)      change the percentage set forth in the definition of
         "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document
         (including this Section) specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
         (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights
         thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder,
         without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such
         Class, as the case may be);

                  (vi)     release any Guarantor from its Guarantee (except as
         expressly provided in Article VII), or limit its liability in respect
         of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender;

                  (vii)    release all or a substantial portion of the
         Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents or alter the
         relative priorities of the Obligations entitled to the Liens of the
         Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional
         Obligations equally and ratably with the other Obligations), in each
         case without the written consent of each Lender;

                  (viii)   change any provisions of any Loan Document in a
         manner that by its terms materially adversely affects the rights in
         respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class
         differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the
         written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the
         outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class; or

                  (ix)     without the consent of the Required Lenders and Term
         Loan Lenders holding more than 50% of the principal amount of the
         outstanding Term Loans, change the order of application of prepayments
         among Term Loans and Revolving Commitments under Section 2.10(g) or
         change the application of prepayments of Term Loans set forth in
         Section 2.10(g) to the remaining scheduled amortization payments to be
         made thereon under Section 2.09.

                                     -115-

provided, further, that (1) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case
may be, (2) any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its
terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Revolving Lenders
(but not the Term Loan Lenders) or the Term Loan Lenders (but not the Revolving
Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by Borrower and the requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of
Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such
Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time, and (3)
any waiver, amendment or modification prior to the achievement of a Successful
Syndication may not be effected without the written consent of the Arranger.

                  (c)      If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by
Section 11.02(b) (other than clause (iii) of such Section), the consent of the
Supermajority Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of such other
Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then Borrower shall have the
right to replace all, but not less than all, of such non-consenting Lender or
Lenders (so long as all non-consenting Lenders are so replaced) with one or more
persons pursuant to Section 2.16 so long as at the time of such replacement each
such new Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination; provided, however, that Borrower shall not have the right to
replace a Lender solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender's rights (and
the withholding of any required consent by such Lender) pursuant to clause (iii)
of Section 11.02(b).

                  (d)      In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, Borrower and the Lenders providing the relevant
Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to permit the refinancing of all
outstanding Term Loans ("REFINANCED TERM LOANS") with a replacement term loan
tranche hereunder which shall constitute Term Loans hereunder ("REPLACEMENT TERM
LOANS"); provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of Replacement Term
Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of Refinanced Term Loans,
(ii) the Applicable Margin for Replacement Term Loans shall not be higher than
the Applicable Margin for Refinanced Term Loans, (iii) the weighted average life
to maturity of Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the weighted
average life to maturity of Refinanced Term Loans at the time of such
refinancing and (iv) all other terms applicable to Replacement Term Loans shall
be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing
Replacement Term Loans than, those applicable to Refinanced Term Loans, except
to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to
any period after the Final Maturity Date in effect immediately prior to such
refinancing.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (b) of this
Section to the contrary, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be
amended at any time and from time to time to increase the aggregate Revolving
Commitments or to establish one or more Classes of Term Loans and/or Revolving
Commitments by an agreement in writing entered into by Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each person (including any
Lender) that shall agree to provide such Commitment or make a Term Loan of any
Class so established (and each such person that shall not already be a Lender
shall, at the time such agreement becomes effective, become a Lender with the
same effect as if it had originally been a Lender under this Agreement with the
Commitment and/or Term Loans set forth in such agreement); provided that the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the new Term Loans and the new
Commitments of all Classes shall at no time, without the consent of the Required
Lenders, exceed $50 million and, at the time of such amendment and immediately
after giving effect thereto, no Default

                                     -116-

<PAGE>

shall have occurred and be continuing and Borrower shall be in compliance (on a
Pro Forma Basis) with each of the covenants set forth in Section 6.10. Any such
agreement shall amend the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to set forth the terms of each Class of Term Loans or Commitments
established thereby (including the amount and final maturity thereof (which
shall not be earlier than the Revolving Maturity Date), any provisions relating
to the amortization or mandatory prepayment thereof, the interest to accrue and
be payable thereon and any fees to be payable in respect thereof) and to effect
such other changes (including changes to the provisions of this Section, Section
2.14 and the definition of "Required Lenders") as Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall deem necessary or advisable in connection with the
establishment of any such Class; provided that no such agreement shall (i)
effect any change described in any of clauses (i)-(ix) of paragraph (b) of this
Section without the consent of each person required to consent to such change
under such clause (it being agreed, however, that any increase in the Revolving
Commitment or establishment of any Class of Term Loans will not, of itself, be
deemed to effect any of the changes described in clauses (vi) through (viii) and
clause (1) of such paragraph (b)), (ii) amend Article V, VI or VIII to establish
any affirmative or negative covenant, Event of Default or remedy that by its
terms benefits one or more Classes, but not all Classes, of Loans or Borrowings
without the prior written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of
the Loans and Commitments of each Class not so benefited (it being agreed that
no provision requiring Borrower to prepay Term Loans of one or more Classes
pursuant to Sections 2.10(c) through (g) shall be deemed to violate this clause)
or (iii) change any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
that creates rights in favor of Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of any
existing Class, other than as necessary or advisable in the judgment of the
Administrative Agent to cause such provision to take into account, or to make
the benefits of such provision available to, Lenders holding Term Loans of such
new Class or such new Commitments. The Loans, Commitments and Borrowings of any
Class established pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute Loans, Commitments
and Borrowings under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by,
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the
foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the Guarantees and security
interests created by the Security Documents. The Loans Parties shall take any
actions reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to ensure and/or
demonstrate that the Lien and security interests granted by the Security
Documents continue to be perfected under the UCC or otherwise after the
establishment of any such Class of Term Loans or any such new Commitments. For
the purpose of providing that the respective amounts of Revolving Loans held by
the Revolving Lenders are held by them on a pro rata basis according to their
respective Revolving Loan Commitments, upon the effectiveness of any increase in
the Revolving Commitments occasioned by an amendment made pursuant to this
Section 11.02(e), (i) all outstanding Revolving Loans shall be converted into a
single Revolving Loan that is a Eurodollar Revolving Loan (with an interest
period to be selected by Borrower), and upon such conversion Borrower shall pay
any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.13, if any, (ii) any new Revolving
Borrowings on such date shall also be part of such single Revolving Loan and
(iii) each Revolving Lender (including each new Revolving Lender) shall hold a
portion of such single Revolving Loan equal to its Pro Rata Percentage thereof
and any fundings on such date shall be made in such a manner so as to achieve
the foregoing.

                  SECTION  11.03 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY. (a) The Loan Parties
agree, jointly and severally, to pay, promptly upon demand:

                  (i)      all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
         incurred by the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
         Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank, including the
         reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Advisors for the
         Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline
         Lender and the Issuing Bank, in

                                     -117-

<PAGE>

         connection with the syndication of the Loans and Commitments, the
         preparation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the
         administration of the Loans and Commitments, the perfection and
         maintenance of the Liens securing the Collateral and any actual or
         proposed amendment, supplement or waiver of any of the Loan Documents
         (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall
         be consummated);

                  (ii)     all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative
         Agent or the Collateral Agent, including the fees, charges and
         disbursements of Advisors for the Administrative Agent and the
         Collateral Agent, in connection with any action, suit or other
         proceeding affecting the Collateral or any part thereof, in which
         action, suit or proceeding the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
         Agent is made a party or participates or in which the right to use the
         Collateral or any part thereof is threatened, or in which it becomes
         necessary in the judgment of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
         Agent to defend or uphold the Liens granted by the Security Documents
         (including any action, suit or proceeding to establish or uphold the
         compliance of the Collateral with any Requirements of Law);

                  (iii)    all costs and expenses incurred by the Arranger, the
         Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender, the
         Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and
         disbursements of Advisors for the Arranger, the Administrative Agent,
         the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender, the Issuing Bank or any
         Lender, incurred in connection with the enforcement or protection of
         its rights under the Loan Documents, including its rights under this
         Section 11.03(a), or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of
         Credit issued hereunder and the collection of the Obligations,
         including all such costs and expenses incurred during any workout,
         restructuring or negotiations in respect of the Obligations; and

                  (iv)     all documentary and similar taxes and charges in
         respect of the Loan Documents.

For purposes of this Section 11.03(a), "ADVISORS" shall mean legal counsel
(including local counsel), auditors, accountants, consultants, appraisers or
other advisors; provided that (x) in the case of clause (i), the engagement of
any Advisors other than legal counsel (including local counsel) shall be subject
to approval by Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
(y) in the case of clause (iii), the engagement of any Advisors other than one
firm of legal counsel by any Lender shall be subject to approval by the
Administrative Agent.

                  (b)      The Loan Parties agree, jointly and severally, to
indemnify the Agents, each Lender, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender,
each Affiliate of any of the foregoing persons and each of their respective
partners, controlling persons, directors, officers, trustees, employees and
agents (each such person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and to hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, penalties, judgments, suits and related
expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred
by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with,
or as a result of (i) the execution, delivery, performance, administration or
enforcement of the Loan Documents, (ii) any actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Loans or issuance of Letters of Credit, (iii) any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, or (iv) any actual or alleged
presence or Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Materials, on, at, under
or from any property owned, leased or operated by any Company at any time, or
any Environmental Claim related in any way to any Company; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses

                                     -118-

<PAGE>

are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

                  (c)      The provisions of this Section 11.03 shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term
of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, the release of all or any
portion of the Collateral, the expiration of the Commitments, the expiration of
any Letter of Credit, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts
due under this Section 11.03 shall be payable on written demand therefor
accompanied by reasonable documentation with respect to any reimbursement,
indemnification or other amount requested.

                  (d)      To the extent that Borrower fails to promptly pay any
amount required to be paid by it to the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender,
as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that
the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such
unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against any of the Agents, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender
in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall
be determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposure,
outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at the time.

                  SECTION  11.04 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that
neither Borrower nor any Subsidiary Guarantor may assign or otherwise transfer
any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
Bank, the Swingline Lender and each Lender (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the other
Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

                  (b)      Any Lender shall have the right at any time to assign
to one or more banks, insurance companies, investment companies or funds or
other institutions (other than Borrower or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof)
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);
provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate
of a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, the Administrative Agent and, after the
achievement of a Successful Syndication, Borrower (and, in the case of an
assignment of all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or any Lender's
obligations in respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the Issuing
Bank and the Swingline Lender) must give its prior written consent to such
assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii)
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or a
Lender Affiliate, any assignment made in connection with the syndication of the
Commitment and Loans by the Arranger or an assignment of the entire remaining
amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the
Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1.0
million unless each of Borrower and the Administrative

                                     -119-

Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, except that this clause (iii) shall not be
construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments
or Loans, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500 (provided that assignments by any Lender to
multiple Affiliates as part of a single assignment shall be subject to only one
such processing and recordation fee), and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire; and provided, further, that any consent of Borrower otherwise
required under this paragraph shall not be required if a Default has occurred
and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement (provided that
any liability of Borrower to such assignee under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15
shall be limited to the amount, if any, that would have been payable thereunder
by Borrower in the absence of such assignment, except to the extent any such
amounts are attributable to a Change in Law occurring after the date of such
assignment), and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 and 11.03).

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as
an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error, and Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower, the
Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender and any Lender (with
respect to its own interest only), at any reasonable time and from time to time
upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (e)      Any Lender shall have the right at any time, without
the consent of Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender to sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and

                                     -120-

<PAGE>

directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso to Section 11.02(b)
that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section,
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such
Participant agrees in writing to be subject to Section 2.14(c) as though it were
a Lender. Each Lender shall, acting for this purpose as an agent of Borrower,
maintain at one of its offices a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of its Participants, and the amount and terms of its participations;
provided that no Lender shall be required to disclose or share the information
contained in such register with Borrower or any other party, except as required
by applicable law.

                  (f)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with the prior written consent of Borrower (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless
Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of Borrower, to comply with Sections 2.15(e)
and (f) as though it were a Lender.

                  (g)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank
loans, such Lender may, without the consent of Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, collaterally assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement, including the Loans and Notes or any other instrument evidencing its
rights as a Lender under this Agreement, to any holder of, trustee for, or any
other representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued, by
such fund, as security for such obligations or securities.

                  SECTION  11.05 SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT. All covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan
Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection
with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any
Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation
made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit
is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
The provisions of

                                     -121-

<PAGE>

Sections 2.12, 2.14, 2.15 and 11.03 and Article X shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the payment of the
Reimbursement Obligations, the expiration or termination of the Letters of
Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision
hereof.

                  SECTION  11.06 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letter constitute the entire contract among
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all
previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject
matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION  11.07 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION  11.08 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates are
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at
any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account
of Borrower against any and all of the obligations of Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

                  SECTION  11.09 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE
OF PROCESS. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND
GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW
PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER
JURISDICTION.

                  (b)      Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner

                                     -122-

<PAGE>

provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document against any Loan Party or its properties in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c)      Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this
Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  (d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any
Loan Document the manner provided for notices in Section 11.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.

                  SECTION  11.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  SECTION  11.11 HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION  11.12 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates' and Lender Affiliates' directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential pursuant to the terms hereof), (b) to the extent
requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable
laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any
other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section 11.12, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement, (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to Borrower and its
obligations or (iii) any rating agency for the purpose of obtaining a credit
rating applicable to any Loan or Loan Party, (g) with the consent of Borrower or
(h) to the extent

                                     -123-

<PAGE>

such Information (i) is publicly available at the time of disclosure or becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii)
becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on
a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Borrower or any Subsidiary. For
the purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" means (i) all financial information
received from Borrower or any Subsidiary and (ii) all other information received
from Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to Borrower or any Subsidiary or its
business that is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by
Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any person required to maintain the confidentiality
of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such person would
accord to its own confidential information.

                  SECTION  11.13 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to
any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as
interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the "CHARGES"), shall
exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                  SECTION  11.14 LENDER ADDENDUM. Each Lender to become a party
to this Agreement on the date hereof shall do so by delivering to the
Administrative Agent a Lender Addendum duly executed by such Lender, Borrower
and the Administrative Agent.

                  SECTION  11.15 OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, all obligations of the Loan Parties hereunder shall
be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

                  (a)      any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of any
         Loan Party;

                  (b)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
         Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto against
         any Loan Party;

                  (c)      any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any
         other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from any
         Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (d)      any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other
         Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to any
         departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations;

                  (e)      any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of any
         right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect hereof or any
         Loan Document; or

                                     -124-

<PAGE>

                  (f)      any other circumstances which might otherwise
         constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Loan Parties.

                  SECTION  11.16 ESCROW AGREEMENTS. The parties hereto
acknowledge that in connection with the Acquisition, the Sellers and Borrower
are entering into the Escrow Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the

                  WHEREAS, the Subsidiary Guarantors have entered into the
Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to
make the Loans and the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit to or for the
benefit of Borrower;

                  WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5.11(b) of the Credit Agreement
and Section 3.5 of the Security Agreement, each Subsidiary (other than any
applicable Foreign Subsidiary or Non-Guarantor Subsidiary) that was not in
existence on the date of the Credit Agreement is required to become a Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Credit Agreement and a Guarantor and Pledgor under the

to the Credit Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make additional

                  NOW, THEREFORE, the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and
the New Guarantor hereby agree as follows:

<PAGE>

         A.       GUARANTEE. In accordance with Section 5.11(b) of the Credit
                  Agreement and 3.5 of the Security Agreement, the New Guarantor
                  by its signature below becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor under
                  the Credit Agreement and a Guarantor and Pledgor under the
                  Security Agreement with the same force and effect as if
                  originally named therein as a Subsidiary Guarantor and a
                  Guarantor and Pledgor, respectively.

         B.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The New Guarantor hereby (a)
                  agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement
                  and the Security Agreement applicable to it as a Subsidiary
                  Guarantor and a Guarantor and Pledgor, respectively,
                  thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the
                  representations and warranties made by it as a Subsidiary
                  Guarantor and a Guarantor and Pledgor, respectively,
                  thereunder are true and correct in all material respects
                  (except that any representation and warranty that is qualified
                  as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be true
                  and correct in all respects) on and as of the date hereof.
                  Each reference to a Subsidiary Guarantor in the Credit
                  Agreement shall be deemed to include the New Guarantor. The
                  New Guarantor hereby attaches supplements to each of the
                  schedules to the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement
                  applicable to it.

         C.       SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Joinder Agreement which is
                  prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
                  such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
                  prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
                  remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
                  unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
                  render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         D.       COUNTERPARTS. This Joinder Agreement may be executed in
                  counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original.
                  Delivery of an executed signature page to this Joinder
                  Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as
                  delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Joinder
                  Agreement.

         E.       NO WAIVER. Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Credit
                  Agreement and the Security Agreement shall remain in full
                  force and effect.

         F.       NOTICES. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the New
                  Guarantor, any Agent or any Lender shall be governed by the
                  terms of Section 11.01 of the Credit Agreement.

         G.       GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
                  OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
                  AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
                  REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE
                  APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

                  THIS LANDLORD ACCESS AGREEMENT (the "AGREEMENT") is made and
entered into as of [ ], by and between [ ], having an office at [ ]("LANDLORD")
and UBS AG, STAMFORD BRANCH, as collateral agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined)), having an

capacity, "COLLATERAL AGENT").

                                R E C I T A L S :

                  A.       Landlord is the record title holder and owner of the
real property described in Schedule A attached hereto (the "REAL PROPERTY").

                  B.       Landlord has leased all or a portion of the Real
Property (the "LEASED PREMISES") to [  ], a [  ] [  ] ("LESSEE" [or "BORROWER"])
pursuant to a certain lease agreement or agreements described in Schedule B
attached hereto (collectively, and as amended, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "LEASE").

                  C.       [Lessee, Ionics, Incorporated, a Massachusetts
corporation ("BORROWER")](1) [Borrower] and the Collateral Agent, among others,
have entered into a credit agreement, dated as of February 13, 2004, (as
amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"; capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement),
pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed to make certain loans to Borrower

                  D.       [Lessee is a subsidiary of Borrower.](2)

                  E.       [Lessee has, pursuant to the Credit Agreement,

Lessee's personal property, inventory, accounts, goods, machinery, equipment,
furniture and fixtures (together with all additions, substitutions, replacements
and improvements to, and proceeds of, the foregoing, collectively, the "PERSONAL
PROPERTY").

                  G.       Collateral Agent has requested that Landlord execute
this Agreement as a condition precedent to the making of the Loans under the
Credit Agreement and Landlord is willing to so execute this Agreement.

                               A G R E E M E N T :

                  NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, Landlord hereby represents, warrants and agrees in favor of
Collateral Agent, as follows:

                  1.       Landlord certifies that (i) Landlord is the landlord
under the Lease described in Schedule B attached hereto, (ii) the Lease is in
full force and effect and has not been amended, modified or supplemented except
as set forth in Schedule B hereto and (iii) Landlord has sent no notice of
default to Lessee under the Lease respecting a default which has not been cured
by Lessee.

                  2.       Landlord hereby covenants to the granting of a
security interest in that portion of the Personal Property located on or about
the Real Property and agrees that the Personal Property is and will remain
personal property and not fixtures even though it may be affixed to or placed on
the Leased Premises. Landlord further agrees that Collateral Agent has the right
to remove the Personal Property from the Leased Premises at any time in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents; provided that Collateral Agent
shall repair any damage arising from such removal. Landlord further agrees that
it will not hinder Collateral Agent's actions in removing Personal Property from
the Leased Premises or Collateral Agent's actions in otherwise enforcing its
security interest in the Personal Property. Collateral Agent shall not be liable
for any diminution in value of the Leased Premises caused by the absence of
Personal Property actually removed or by the need to replace the Personal
Property after such removal. Landlord acknowledges that Collateral Agent shall
have no obligation to remove the Personal Property from the Leased Premises.

                  3.       Landlord acknowledges and agrees that Lessee's
granting of a security interest in the Personal Property in favor of the
Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall not constitute a
default under the Lease nor permit Landlord to terminate the Lease or re-enter
or repossess the Leased Premises or otherwise be the basis for the exercise of
any remedy by Landlord and Landlord hereby expressly consents to the granting of
such security interest and agrees that such security interest shall be superior
to any lien of the Landlord (statutory or otherwise) in the Personal Property.

                  4.       The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of
Landlord (including, without limitation, any successor owner of the Real
Property) and Collateral Agent. Landlord will disclose the terms and conditions
of this Agreement to any purchaser or successor to Landlord's interest in the
Leased Premises.

shall be in writing and sent to such party at its respective address set forth
above (or at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a
written notice to the other party complying as to delivery with the terms of
this Section 5) by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or
by overnight delivery service.

                  6.       The provisions of this Agreement shall continue in
effect until Landlord shall have received Collateral Agent's written
certification that the Loans have been paid in full and all of Borrower's other
Obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been
satisfied.

                  7.       THE INTERPRETATION, VALIDITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

                  8.       Landlord agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver
such further instruments as Collateral Agent may request to allow for the proper
recording of this Agreement (including, without limitation, a revised landlord's
access agreement in form and substance sufficient for recording) or to otherwise
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement.

                  (i)      Any Rents receivable by the Mortgagee hereunder,
after payment of all proper costs and expenses as Mortgagee may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate (including the payment of reasonable
costs and expenses in connection with the maintenance, operation, improvement,
insurance, taxes and upkeep of the Mortgaged Property), shall be applied in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10.2 of this Mortgage. The Mortgagee
shall be accountable to the Mortgagor only for Rents actually received by the
Mortgagee. The collection of such Rents and the application thereof shall not
cure or waive any Event of Default or waive, modify or affect notice of Event of
Default or invalidate any act done pursuant to such notice.

                  (ii)     The Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and
directs Tenant under each Lease to rely upon and comply with any and all notices
or demands from the Mortgagee for payment of Rents to the Mortgagee and the
Mortgagor shall have no claim against Tenant for Rents paid by Tenant to the
Mortgagee pursuant to such notice or demand.

                  SECTION 6.3. No Release. Neither this Mortgage nor any action
or inaction on the part of the Mortgagee shall release Tenant under any Lease,
any guarantor of any Lease or the Mortgagor from any of their respective
obligations under such Leases or constitute an assumption of any such obligation
on the part of the Mortgagee. No action or failure to act on the part of the
Mortgagor shall adversely affect or limit the rights of the Mortgagee under this
Mortgage or, through this Mortgage, under such Leases. Nothing contained herein
shall operate or be construed to (i) obligate the Mortgagee to perform any of
the terms, covenants or conditions contained in any Lease or otherwise to impose
any obligation upon the Mortgagee with respect to such Lease (including, without
limitation, any obligation arising out of any covenant of quiet enjoyment
contained in such Lease in the event that Tenant under such Lease shall have
been joined as a party defendant in any action by which the estate of such
Tenant shall

                                      -16-

be terminated) or (ii) place upon the Mortgagee any responsibility
for the operation, control, care, management or repair of the Premises.

                  SECTION 6.4. Irrevocable Interest. All rights, powers and
privileges of the Mortgagee herein set forth are coupled with an interest and
are irrevocable, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and the Mortgagor
shall not take any action under the Leases or otherwise which is inconsistent
with this Mortgage or any of the terms hereof and any such action inconsistent
herewith or therewith shall be void.

                  SECTION 6.5. Amendment to Leases. Each Lease, including,
without limitation, all amendments, modifications, supplements, replacements,
extensions and renewals thereof, shall continue to be subject to the provisions
hereof without the necessity of any further act by any of the parties hereto.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

receipts evidencing the payment of all such Charges.

                  SECTION 7.2. Escrow of Taxes. From and after the occurrence of
an Event of Default, at the option and upon the request of the Mortgagee, the
Mortgagor shall deposit with the Mortgagee in an account maintained by the
Mortgagee (the "Tax Escrow Fund"), on the first day of each month, an amount
estimated by the Mortgagee to be equal to one-twelfth of the annual real
property taxes and other annual Charges required to be discharged by the
Mortgagor under Section 7.1 hereof. Such amounts shall be held by the Mortgagee
without interest to the Mortgagor and applied to the payment of the obligations
in respect of which such amounts were deposited, in such priority as the
Mortgagee shall determine, on or before the respective dates on which such
obligations or any part thereof would become delinquent. Nothing contained in
this Article VII shall (i) affect any right or remedy of the Mortgagee under any
provision hereof or of any statute or rule of law to pay any such amount as
provided above from its own funds and to add the amount so paid, together with
interest at the default rate during such time that any amount remains
outstanding, to the Secured Obligations or (ii) relieve the Mortgagor of its
obligations to make or provide for the payment of the annual real property taxes
and other annual Charges required to be discharged by the Mortgagor under
Section 7.1 hereof.

                  SECTION 7.3. Certain Statutory Liens. Unless and to the extent
contested by the Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.02 (a)
and (b) of the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagor shall timely pay, or cause to be

government agencies administering worker's compensation

                                      -17-

insurance, old age pensions and social security benefits and all other claims,
judgments, demands or amounts of any nature which, if unpaid, might result in,
or permit the creation of, a Lien on the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof,
or which might result in forfeiture of all or any part of the Mortgaged
Property.

                  SECTION 7.4. Stamp and Other Taxes. Unless and to the extent
contested by the Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII
hereof, the Mortgagor shall pay any United States documentary stamp taxes, with
interest and fines and penalties, and any mortgage recording taxes, with
interest and fines and penalties, that may hereafter be levied, imposed or
assessed under or upon or by reason hereof or the Secured Obligations or any
instrument or transaction affecting or relating to either thereof and in default
thereof the Mortgagee may advance the same and the amount so advanced shall be
payable by the Mortgagor to the Mortgagee in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement hereof.

                  SECTION 7.5. Certain Tax Law Changes. In the event of the
passage after the date hereof of any law deducting from the value of real
property, for the purpose of taxation, amounts in respect of any Lien thereon or
changing in any way the laws for the taxation of mortgages or debts secured by
mortgages for state or local purposes or the manner of the collection of any
Charges, and imposing any Charges, either directly or indirectly, on this
Mortgage or any other Loan Document, the Mortgagor shall promptly pay to the
Mortgagee such amount or amounts as may be necessary from time to time to pay
any such Charges.

                  SECTION 7.6. Proceeds of Tax Claim. In the event that the
proceeds of any tax claim are paid after the Mortgagee has exercised its right
to foreclose the Lien hereof, such proceeds shall be paid to the Mortgagee to
satisfy any deficiency remaining after such foreclosure. The Mortgagee shall
retain its interest in the proceeds of any tax claim during any redemption
period. The amount of any such proceeds in excess of any deficiency claim of the
Mortgagee shall in a reasonably prompt manner be released to the Mortgagor.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                             CONTESTING OF PAYMENTS

                  SECTION 9.1. Destruction, Condemnation and Restoration. If
there shall occur any Destruction, the Mortgagor shall promptly send to the
Mortgagee a written notice setting forth the nature and extent of such
Destruction. The proceeds of any insurance payable in respect of such
Destruction are hereby assigned and shall be paid to the Mortgagee. All Net
Insurance such proceeds shall constitute Net Cash Proceeds under the Credit
Agreement and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10
of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.2. Condemnation. If there shall occur any Taking or
the commencement of any proceeding therefor, the Mortgagor shall immediately
notify the Mortgagee upon receiving notice of such Taking or commencement of
proceedings therefor. The Mortgagee may, at its option, participate in any
proceedings or negotiations which might result in any Taking, and the Mortgagor
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Mortgagee all instruments
requested by it to permit such participation. The Mortgagee may be represented
by counsel satisfactory to it at the expense of the Mortgagor in connection with
any such participation. The Mortgagor shall pay all reasonable fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Mortgagee in connection with any Taking and in seeking
and obtaining any award or payment on account thereof. Any proceeds, award or
payment in respect of any Taking are herby assigned and shall be paid to the
Mortgagee. The Mortgagor shall take all steps necessary to notify the condemning
authority of such assignment. All such proceeds shall constitute Net Cash
Proceeds under the Credit Agreement and shall be applied in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.3. Restoration. In the event the Mortgagor is
permitted or required to perform any Restoration in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement, the proceeds of any award
payable in respect of a Destruction or a Taking shall constitute Net Cash
Proceeds and the Mortgagee shall release such Proceeds to the Mortgagor in
compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit
Agreement, and the Mortgagor shall complete the restoration in accordance with
provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement. In the event there shall be
any surplus after the application of such proceeds to the Restoration of the
Improvements, such surplus should be applied as Net Cash Proceeds in accordance
with Section 2.10 (e)(iii) of the Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 10.2. Remedies in Case of an Event of Default. If any
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Mortgagee may at its
option, in addition to any other action permitted under this Mortgage or the
Credit Agreement or by law, statute or in equity, take one or more of the
following actions to the greatest extent permitted by local law:

                  (i)      by written notice to the Mortgagor, declare the
         entire unpaid amount of the Secured Obligations to be due and payable
         immediately;

                  (ii)     personally, or by its agents or attorneys, (A) enter
         into and upon and take possession of all or any part of the Premises
         together with the books, records and accounts of the Mortgagor relating
         thereto and, exclude the Mortgagor, its agents and servants wholly
         therefrom, (B) use, operate, manage and control the Premises and
         conduct the business thereof, (C) maintain and restore the Premises,
         (D) make all necessary or proper repairs, renewals and replacements and
         such useful Alterations thereto and thereon as the Mortgagee may deem

         with respect thereto either in the name of the Mortgagor or otherwise

         liability for or by reason of any such taking of possession, entry,
         removal or holding, operation or management except that any amounts so
         received by the Mortgagee shall be applied in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement.

                  (iii)    with or without entry, personally or by its agents or
         attorneys, (A) sell the Mortgaged Property and all estate, right, title
         and interest, claim and demand therein at one or more sales in one or
         more parcels, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.3 or (B)
         institute and prosecute proceedings for the complete or partial
         foreclosure of the Lien and security interests created and evidenced
         hereby; or

                  (iv)     take such steps to protect and enforce its rights
         whether by action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity for the
         specific performance of any covenant, condition or agreement in the
         Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in aid of the
         execution of any power granted in this Mortgage, or for any foreclosure
         hereunder, or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or
         equitable remedy or otherwise as the Mortgagee shall elect.

                  SECTION 10.3. Sale of Mortgaged Property if Event of Default
Occurs; Proceeds of Sale.

                  (i)      If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Mortgagee may institute an action to foreclose this Mortgage or
take such other action as may be permitted and available to the Mortgagee at law
or in equity for the enforcement of the Credit Agreement and realization on the
Mortgaged Property and proceeds thereon through power of sale (if then available
under applicable law) or to final judgment and execution thereof for the Secured
Obligations, and in furtherance thereof the Mortgagee may sell the Mortgaged
Property at one or more sales, as an entirety or in parcels, at such time and
place, upon such terms and after such notice thereof as may be required or
permitted by law or statute or in equity. The

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

Mortgagee may execute and deliver to the purchaser at such sale a conveyance of
the Mortgaged Property in fee simple and an assignment or conveyance of all the
Mortgagor's Interest in the Leases and the Mortgaged Property, each of which
conveyances and assignments shall contain recitals as to the Event of Default
upon which the execution of the power of sale herein granted depends, and the
Mortgagor hereby constitutes and appoints the Mortgagee the true and lawful
attorney in fact of the Mortgagor to make any such recitals, sale, assignment
and conveyance, and all of the acts of the Mortgagee as such attorney in fact
are hereby ratified and confirmed. The Mortgagor agrees that such recitals shall
be binding and conclusive upon the Mortgagor and that any assignment or
conveyance to be made by the Mortgagee shall divest the Mortgagor of all right,
title, interest, equity and right of redemption, including any statutory
redemption, in and to the Mortgaged Property. The power and agency hereby
granted are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable by death or
dissolution, or otherwise, and are in addition to any and all other remedies
which the Mortgagee may have hereunder, at law or in equity. So long as the
Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, remain unpaid, the Mortgagor agrees
that possession of the Mortgaged Property by the Mortgagor, or any person
claiming under the Mortgagor, shall be as tenant, and, in case of a sale under
power or upon foreclosure as provided in this Mortgage, the Mortgagor and any
person in possession under the Mortgagor, as to whose interest such sale was not
made subject, shall, at the option of the purchaser at such sale, then become
and be tenants holding over, and shall forthwith deliver possession to such
purchaser, or be summarily dispossessed in accordance with the laws applicable
to tenants holding over. In case of any sale under this Mortgage by virtue of
the exercise of the powers herein granted, or pursuant to any order in any
judicial proceeding or otherwise, the Mortgaged Property may be sold as an
entirety or in separate parcels in such manner or order as the Mortgagee in its
sole discretion may elect. One or more exercises of powers herein granted shall
not extinguish or exhaust such powers, until the entire Mortgaged Property is
sold or all amounts secured hereby are paid in full.

                  (ii)     In the event of any sale made under or by virtue of
this Article X, the entire principal of, and interest in respect of the Secured
Obligations, if not previously due and payable, shall, at the option of the
Mortgagee, immediately become due and payable, anything in this Mortgage to the
contrary notwithstanding.

                  (iii)    The proceeds of any sale made under or by virtue of
this Article X, together with any other sums which then may be held by the
Mortgagee under this Mortgage, whether under the provisions of this Article X or
otherwise, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.03 of
the Credit Agreement.

                  (iv)     The Mortgagee (on behalf of any Secured Party or on
its own behalf) or any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates may bid for
and acquire the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof at any sale made under or
by virtue of this Article X and, in lieu of paying cash therefor, may make
settlement for the purchase price by crediting against the purchase price the
unpaid amounts (whether or not then due) owing to the Mortgagee, or such Lender
in respect of the Secured Obligations, after deducting from the sales price the
expense of the sale and the reasonable costs of the action or proceedings and
any other sums that the Mortgagee or such Lender is authorized to deduct under
this Mortgage.

<PAGE>

                  (v)      The Mortgagee may adjourn from time to time any sale
by it to be made under or by virtue hereof by announcement at the time and place
appointed for such sale or for such adjourned sale or sales, and, the Mortgagee,
without further notice or publication, may make such sale at the time and place
to which the same shall be so adjourned.

                  (vi)     If the Premises is comprised of more than one parcel
of land, the Mortgagee may take any of the actions authorized by this Section
10.3 in respect of any or a number of individual parcels.

                  SECTION 10.4. Additional Remedies in Case of an Event of
Default.

                  (i)      The Mortgagee shall be entitled to recover judgment
as aforesaid either before, after or during the pendency of any proceedings for
the enforcement of the provisions hereof, and the right of the Mortgagee to
recover such judgment shall not be affected by any entry or sale hereunder, or
by the exercise of any other right, power or remedy for the enforcement of the
provisions hereof, or the foreclosure of, or absolute conveyance pursuant to,
this Mortgage. In case of proceedings against the Mortgagor in insolvency or
bankruptcy or any proceedings for its reorganization or involving the
liquidation of its assets, the Mortgagee shall be entitled to prove the whole
amount of principal and interest and other payments, charges and costs due in
respect of the Secured Obligations to the full amount thereof without deducting
therefrom any proceeds obtained from the sale of the whole or any part of the
Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that in no case shall the Mortgagee
receive a greater amount than the aggregate of such principal, interest and such
other payments, charges and costs (with interest at the default rate) from the
proceeds of the sale of the Mortgaged Property and the distribution from the
estate of the Mortgagor.

                  (ii)     Any recovery of any judgment by the Mortgagee and any
levy of any execution under any judgment upon the Mortgaged Property shall not
affect in any manner or to any extent the Lien and security interests created
and evidenced hereby upon the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, or any
conveyances, powers, rights and remedies of the Mortgagee hereunder, but such
conveyances, powers, rights and remedies shall continue unimpaired as before.

                  (iii)    Any monies collected by the Mortgagee under this
Section 10.4 shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section
10.3(iii).

                  SECTION 10.5. Legal Proceedings After an Event of Default.

                  (i)      After the occurrence of any Event of Default and
immediately upon the commencement of any action, suit or legal proceedings to
obtain judgment for the Secured Obligations or any part thereof, or of any
proceedings to foreclose the Lien and security interest created and evidenced
hereby or otherwise enforce the provisions hereof or of any other proceedings in
aid of the enforcement hereof, the Mortgagor shall enter its voluntary
appearance in such action, suit or proceeding.

                  (ii)     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall be entitled forthwith as a matter of
right, concurrently or independently of

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

any other right or remedy hereunder either before or after declaring the Secured
Obligations or any part thereof to be due and payable, to the appointment of a
receiver without giving notice to any party and without regard to the adequacy
or inadequacy of any security for the Secured Obligations or the solvency or
insolvency of any person or entity then legally or equitably liable for the
Secured Obligations or any portion thereof. The Mortgagor hereby consents to the
appointment of such receiver. Notwithstanding the appointment of any receiver,
the Mortgagee shall be entitled as pledgee to the possession and control of any
cash, deposits or instruments at the time held by or payable or deliverable
under the terms of the Credit Agreement to the Mortgagee.

                  (iii)    The Mortgagor shall not (A) at any time insist upon,
or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take any benefit or advantage of
any stay or extension or moratorium law, any exemption from execution or sale of
the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, wherever enacted, now or at any time
hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants and terms of performance
hereof, (B) claim, take or insist on any benefit or advantage of any law now or
hereafter in force providing for the valuation or appraisal of the Mortgaged
Property, or any part thereof, prior to any sale or sales of the Mortgaged
Property which may be made pursuant to this Mortgage, or pursuant to any decree,
judgment or order of any court of competent jurisdiction or (C) after any such
sale or sales, claim or exercise any right under any statute heretofore or
hereafter enacted to redeem the property so sold or any part thereof. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Mortgagor hereby expressly (A) waives
all benefit or advantage of any such law or laws, including, without limitation,
any statute of limitations applicable to this Mortgage, (B) waives any and all
rights to trial by jury in any action or proceeding related to the enforcement
hereof, (C) waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding brought in connection with
this Mortgage and further waives and agrees not to plead that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum and (D) covenants not to hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power granted or delegated to the Mortgagee by this Mortgage but to suffer and
permit the execution of every such power as though no such law or laws had been
made or enacted. The Mortgagee shall not be liable for any incorrect or improper
payment made pursuant to this Article X in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

                  SECTION 10.6. Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy conferred upon
or reserved to the Mortgagee by this Mortgage is intended to be exclusive of any
other remedy or remedies, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and
shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Mortgage or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity. Any delay or omission of the Mortgagee
to exercise any right or power accruing on any Event of Default shall not impair
any such right or power and shall not be construed to be a waiver of or
acquiescence in any such Event of Default. Every power and remedy given by this
Mortgage may be exercised from time to time concurrently or independently, when
and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Mortgagee in such order and
manner as the Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, may elect. If the Mortgagee
accepts any monies required to be paid by the Mortgagor under this Mortgage
after the same become due, such acceptance shall not constitute a waiver of the
right either to require prompt payment, when due, of all other sums secured by
this Mortgage or to declare an Event of Default with regard to subsequent
defaults. If the Mortgagee accepts

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

any monies required to be paid by the Mortgagor under this Mortgage in an amount
less than the sum then due, such acceptance shall be deemed an acceptance on
account only and on the condition that it shall not constitute a waiver of the
obligation of the Mortgagor to pay the entire sum then due, and the Mortgagor's
failure to pay the entire sum then due shall be and continue to be a default
hereunder notwithstanding acceptance of such amount on account.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

                      SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

                  SECTION 11.1. Security Agreement. To the extent that the
Mortgaged Property includes personal property or items of personal property
which are or are to become fixtures under applicable law, this Mortgage shall
also be construed as a security agreement under the UCC; and, upon and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall be entitled with
respect to such personal property to exercise all remedies hereunder, all
remedies available under the UCC with respect to fixtures and all other remedies
available under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, such personal
property may, at the Mortgagee's option, (i) be sold hereunder together with any
sale of any portion of the Mortgaged Property or otherwise, (ii) be sold
pursuant to the UCC, or (iii) be dealt with by the Mortgagee in any other manner
permitted under applicable law. The Mortgagee may require the Mortgagor to
assemble such personal property and make it available to the Mortgagee at a
place to be designated by the Mortgagee. The Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees
that a disposition of the personal property in accordance with the Mortgagee's
rights and remedies in respect to the Mortgaged Property as heretofore provided
is a commercially reasonable disposition thereof; provided, however, that the
Mortgagee shall give the Mortgagor not less than ten (10) days' prior notice of
the time and place of any intended disposition.

                  SECTION 11.2. Fixture Filing. To the extent that the Mortgaged
Property includes items of personal property which are or are to become fixtures
under applicable law, and to the extent permitted under applicable law, the
filing hereof in the real estate records of the county in which such Mortgaged
Property is located shall also operate from the time of filing as a fixture
filing with respect to such Mortgaged Property, and the following information is
applicable for the purpose of such fixture filing, to wit:

and continuation statements under the UCC in effect in the jurisdiction in which
the Mortgaged Property is located as may be required by law in order to
establish, preserve and protect the liens and security interests intended to be
granted to the Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage in the Mortgaged Property.

                               FURTHER ASSURANCES

                  SECTION 12.1. Recording Documentation To Assure Security. The
Mortgagor shall, forthwith after the execution and delivery hereof and
thereafter, from time to time, cause this Mortgage and any financing statement,
continuation statement or similar instrument relating to any thereof or to any
property intended to be subject to the Lien hereof to be filed, registered and
recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by any present or
future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect the validity and
priority thereof or the Lien hereof purported to be created upon the Mortgaged
Property and the interest and rights of the Mortgagee therein. The Mortgagor
shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes and fees incident to such filing,
registration and recording, and all expenses incident to the preparation,
execution and acknowledgment thereof, and of any instrument of further
assurance, and all Federal or state stamp taxes or other taxes, duties and
charges arising out of or in connection with the execution and delivery of such
instruments.

                  SECTION 12.2. Further Acts. The Mortgagor shall, at the sole
cost and expense of the Mortgagor, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and
every such further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages, assignments, notices of
assignment, transfers, financing statements, continuation statements,
instruments and assurances as the Mortgagee shall from time to time request,
which may be necessary in the judgment of the Mortgagee from time to time to
assure, perfect, convey, assign, mortgage, transfer and confirm unto the
Mortgagee, the property and rights hereby conveyed or assigned or which the
Mortgagor may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or assign to the
Mortgagee or for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of
the terms hereof or the filing, registering or recording hereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Mortgagee
desires to exercise any remedies, consensual rights or attorney-in-fact powers
set forth in this Mortgage and determines it necessary to obtain any approvals
or consents of any Governmental Authority

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

or any other person therefor, then, upon the reasonable request of the
Mortgagee, the Mortgagor agrees to use its best efforts to assist and aid the
Mortgagee to obtain as soon as practicable any necessary approvals or consents
for the exercise of any such remedies, rights and powers. In the event the
Mortgagor shall fail after demand to execute any instrument or take any action
required to be executed or taken by the Mortgagor under this Section 12.2, the
Mortgagee may execute or take the same as the attorney-in-fact for the
Mortgagor, such power of attorney being coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable.

                  SECTION 12.3. Additional Security. Without notice to or
consent of the Mortgagor and without impairment of the Lien and rights created
by this Mortgage, the Mortgagee may accept (but the Mortgagor shall not be
obligated to furnish) from the Mortgagor or from any other person, additional
security for the Secured Obligations. Neither the giving hereof nor the
acceptance of any such additional security shall prevent the Mortgagee from
resorting, first, to such additional security, and, second, to the security
created by this Mortgage without affecting the Mortgagee's Lien and rights under
this Mortgage.

                                 ARTICLE XIII.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 13.1. Covenants To Run with the Land. All of the
grants, covenants, terms, provisions and conditions in this Mortgage shall run
with the Land and shall apply to, and bind the successors and assigns of, the
Mortgagor. If there shall be more than one mortgagor with respect to the
Mortgaged Property, the covenants and warranties hereof shall be joint and
several.

                  SECTION 13.2. No Merger. The rights and estate created by this
Mortgage shall not, under any circumstances, be held to have merged into any
other estate or interest now owned or hereafter acquired by the Mortgagee unless
the Mortgagee shall have consented to such merger in writing.

                  SECTION 13.3. Concerning Mortgagee.

                  (i)      The Mortgagee has been appointed as Collateral Agent
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The actions of the Mortgagee hereunder are
subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Mortgagee shall have the
right hereunder to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking action (including,
without limitation, the release or substitution of the Mortgaged Property), in
accordance with this Mortgage and the Credit Agreement. The Mortgagee may employ
agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection herewith and shall not be liable for
the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
it in good faith. The Mortgagee may resign and a successor Mortgagee may be
appointed in the manner provided in the Credit Agreement. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as the Mortgagee by a successor Mortgagee, that successor
Mortgagee shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Mortgagee under this
Mortgage, and the retiring Mortgagee shall thereupon be discharged from its
duties and obligations under this Mortgage. After any retiring Mortgagee's
resignation, the provisions hereof shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Mortgage while it was the
Mortgagee.

                  (ii)     The Mortgagee shall be deemed to have exercised
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Mortgaged Property in its
possession if such Mortgaged Property is accorded treatment substantially
equivalent to that which the Mortgagee, in its individual capacity, accords its
own property consisting of similar instruments or interests, it being understood
that neither the Mortgagee nor any of the Secured Parties shall have
responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any
person with respect to any Mortgaged Property.

                  (iii)    The Mortgagee shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notice, statement, certificate, order or other document or any telephone
message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper person, and, with respect to all matters pertaining to
this Mortgage and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.

                  (iv)     With respect to any of its rights and obligations as
a Lender, the Mortgagee shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers
hereunder. The term "Lenders," "Lender" or any similar terms shall, unless the
context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Mortgagee in its individual
capacity as a Lender. The Mortgagee may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the
Mortgagor or any Affiliate of the Mortgagor to the same extent as if the
Mortgagee were not acting as Collateral Agent.

                  (v)      If any portion of the Mortgaged Property also
constitutes collateral granted to the Mortgagee under any other deed of trust,
mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type, in the event of
any conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of such other deed
of trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type in
respect of such collateral, the Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, shall select
which provision or provisions shall control.

                  SECTION 13.4. Mortgagee May Perform; Mortgagee Appointed
Attorney-in-Fact. If the Mortgagor shall fail to perform any covenants contained
in this Mortgage (including, without limitation, the Mortgagor's covenants to
(i) pay the premiums in respect of all required insurance policies hereunder or
under the Credit Agreement, (ii) pay Charges, (iii) make repairs, (iv) discharge
Liens or (v) pay or perform any obligations of the Mortgagor under any Mortgaged
Property) or if any warranty on the part of the Mortgagor contained herein shall
be breached, the Mortgagee may (but shall not be obligated to), after notice to
Mortgagor, do the same or cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and may
expend funds for such purpose; provided, however, that the Mortgagee shall in no
event be bound to inquire into the validity of any tax, lien, imposition or
other obligation which the Mortgagor fails to pay or perform as and when
required hereby and which the Mortgagor does not contest in accordance with the
provisions of Article VIII hereof. Any and all amounts so expended by the
Mortgagee shall be

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

paid by the Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.03 of the
Credit Agreement. Neither the provisions of this Section 13.4 nor any action
taken by the Mortgagee pursuant to the provisions of this Section 13.4 shall
prevent any such failure to observe any covenant contained in this Mortgage nor
any breach of warranty from constituting an Event of Default. The Mortgagor
hereby appoints the Mortgagee its attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the
place and stead of the Mortgagor and in the name of the Mortgagor, or otherwise,
from time to time in the Mortgagee's discretion to take any action and to
execute any instrument consistent with the terms hereof and the other Loan
Documents which the Mortgagee may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the
purposes hereof. The foregoing grant of authority is a power of attorney coupled
with an interest and such appointment shall be irrevocable for the term hereof.
The Mortgagor hereby ratifies all that such attorney shall lawfully do or cause
to be done by virtue hereof.

                  SECTION 13.5. Continuing Security Interest; Assignment. This
Mortgage shall create a continuing Lien on and security interest in the
Mortgaged Property and shall (i) be binding upon the Mortgagor, its successors
and assigns and (ii) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the
Mortgagee hereunder, to the benefit of the Mortgagee for the benefit of the
Secured Parties and each of their respective successors, transferees and
assigns. No other persons (including, without limitation, any other creditor of
any Loan Party) shall have any interest herein or any right or benefit with
respect hereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (ii),
any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any indebtedness held by it secured
by this Mortgage to any other person, and such other person shall thereupon
become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender,
herein or otherwise, subject, however, to the provisions of the Credit
Agreement.

                  SECTION 13.6. Termination; Release. When all the Secured
Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments of the Lenders to make
any Loan or to issue any Letter of Credit under the Credit Agreement shall have
expired or been sooner terminated, this Mortgage shall terminate. Upon
termination hereof or any release of the Mortgaged Property or any portion
thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagee
shall, upon the request and at the sole cost and expense of the Mortgagor,
forthwith assign, transfer and deliver to the Mortgagor, against receipt and
without recourse to or warranty by the Mortgagee, such of the Mortgaged Property
to be released (in the case of a release) as may be in possession of the
Mortgagee and as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the
terms hereof, and, with respect to any other Mortgaged Property, proper
documents and instruments (including UCC-3 termination statements or releases)
acknowledging the termination hereof or the release of such Mortgaged Property,
as the case may be.

                  SECTION 13.7. Modification in Writing. No amendment,
modification, supplement, termination or waiver of or to any provision hereof,
nor consent to any departure by the Mortgagor therefrom, shall be effective
unless the same shall be done in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement and unless in writing and signed by the Mortgagee. Any amendment,
modification or supplement of or to any provision hereof, any waiver of any
provision hereof and any consent to any departure by the Mortgagor from the
terms of any provision hereof shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is
specifically required by this Mortgage or any other

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

Loan Document, no notice to or demand on the Mortgagor in any case shall entitle
the Mortgagor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

                  SECTION 13.8. Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein or in
the Credit Agreement, any notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be given in the manner and become effective as set
forth in the Credit Agreement, if to the Mortgagor or the Mortgagee, addressed
to it at the address set forth in the Credit Agreement, or in each case at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the
other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section 13.8.

                  SECTION 13.9. GOVERNING LAW; SERVICE OF PROCESS; WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL. THIS MORTGAGE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES ARE
LOCATED, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
THAT THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST HEREUNDER, OR REMEDIES
HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT OF ANY PARTICULAR ITEM OR TYPE OF MORTGAGED PROPERTY ARE
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN SUCH STATE. MORTGAGOR AGREES
THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY PROCEEDING MAY BE EFFECTED BY MAILING A COPY
THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL (OR ANY SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR FORM OF
MAIL), POSTAGE PREPAID, TO BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT
AGREEMENT OR AT SUCH OTHER ADDRESS OF WHICH THE MORTGAGEE SHALL HAVE BEEN
NOTIFIED PURSUANT THERETO. IF ANY AGENT APPOINTED BY MORTGAGOR REFUSES TO ACCEPT
SERVICE, MORTGAGOR HEREBY AGREES THAT SERVICE UPON IT BY MAIL SHALL CONSTITUTE
SUFFICIENT NOTICE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF MORTGAGEE TO BRING
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST MORTGAGOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE
MORTGAGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS MORTGAGE OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                  SECTION 13.10. Severability of Provisions. Any provision
hereof which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 13.11. Limitation on Interest Payable. It is the
intention of the parties to conform strictly to the usury laws, whether state or
Federal, that are applicable to the transaction of which this Mortgage is a
part. All agreements between the Mortgagor and the Mortgagee whether now
existing or hereafter arising and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly
limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount paid or
agreed to be paid by the Mortgagor for the use, forbearance or detention of the
money to be loaned under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for
the payment or performance of

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

any covenant or obligation contained herein or in the Credit Agreement or any
other Loan Document, exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable
Federal or state usury laws. If under any circumstances whatsoever fulfillment
of any such provision, at the time performance of such provision shall be due,
shall involve exceeding the limit of validity prescribed by law, then the
obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity. If
under any circumstances the Mortgagor shall have paid an amount deemed interest
by applicable law, which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount that
would be excessive interest under applicable usury laws shall be applied to the
reduction of the principal amount owing in respect of the Secured Obligations
and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the
unpaid balance of principal and any other amounts due hereunder, the excess
shall be refunded to the Mortgagor. All sums paid or agreed to be paid for the
use, forbearance or detention of the principal under any extension of credit by
the Mortgagee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and to the
extent necessary to preclude exceeding the limit of validity prescribed by law,
be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread from the date hereof until payment
in full of the Secured Obligations so that the actual rate of interest on
account of such principal amounts is uniform throughout the term hereof.

                  SECTION 13.12. Business Days. In the event any time period or
any date provided in this Mortgage ends or falls on a day other than a Business
Day, then such time period shall be deemed to end and such date shall be deemed
to fall on the next succeeding Business Day, and performance herein may be made
on such Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on such other
day.

                  SECTION 13.13. Relationship. The relationship of the Mortgagee
to the Mortgagor hereunder is strictly and solely that of lender and borrower
and mortgagor and mortgagee and nothing contained in the Credit Agreement, this
Mortgage or any other document or instrument now existing and delivered in
connection therewith or otherwise in connection with the Secured Obligations is
intended to create, or shall in any event or under any circumstance be construed
as creating a partnership, joint venture, tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy or
other relationship of any nature whatsoever between the Mortgagee and the
Mortgagor other than as lender and borrower and mortgagor and mortgagee.

                  SECTION 13.14. Waiver of Stay.

                  (i)      The Mortgagor agrees that in the event that the
Mortgagor or any property or assets of the Mortgagor shall hereafter become the
subject of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or
the Mortgagor shall otherwise be a party to any Federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or similar proceeding to which the provisions relating to
the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar
provision in any such law is applicable, then, in any such case, whether or not
the Mortgagee has commenced foreclosure proceedings under this Mortgage, the
Mortgagee shall be entitled to relief from any such automatic stay as it relates
to the exercise of any of the rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, any foreclosure proceedings) available to the Mortgagee as provided
in this Mortgage or in any other Security Document.

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

                  (ii)     The Mortgagee shall have the right to petition or
move any court having jurisdiction over any proceeding described in Section
13.14 hereof for the purposes provided therein, and the Mortgagor agrees (i) not
to oppose any such petition or motion and (ii) at the Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense, to assist and cooperate with the Mortgagee, as may be requested by the
Mortgagee from time to time, in obtaining any relief requested by the Mortgagee,
including, without limitation, by filing any such petitions, supplemental
petitions, requests for relief, documents, instruments or other items from time
to time requested by the Mortgagee or any such court.

                  SECTION 13.15. No Credit for Payment of Taxes or Impositions.
The Mortgagor shall not be entitled to any credit against the principal,
premium, if any, or interest payable under the Credit Agreement, and the
Mortgagor shall not be entitled to any credit against any other sums which may
become payable under the terms thereof or hereof, by reason of the payment of
any Charge on the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof.

                  SECTION 13.16. No Claims Against the Mortgagee. Nothing
contained in this Mortgage shall constitute any consent or request by the
Mortgagee, express or implied, for the performance of any labor or services or
the furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Premises or
any part thereof, nor as giving the Mortgagor any right, power or authority to
contract for or permit the performance of any labor or services or the
furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would permit
the making of any claim against the Mortgagee in respect thereof or any claim
that any Lien based on the performance of such labor or services or the
furnishing of any such materials or other property is prior to the Lien hereof.

                  SECTION 13.17. Obligations Absolute. All obligations of the
Mortgagor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

                  (i)      any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of the
         Mortgagor or any other Obligor;

                  (ii)     any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
         Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or any other
         agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iii)    any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or
         any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from
         the Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or
         any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iv)     any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other
         Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to any
         departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the Secured
         Obligations;

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

                  (v)      any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of any
         right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect hereof or any
         other Loan Document except as specifically set forth in a waiver
         granted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.17 hereof; or

                  (vi)     any other circumstances which might otherwise
         constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Mortgagor.

                  SECTION 13.18. Mortgagee's Right To Sever Indebtedness.

                  (i)      The Mortgagor acknowledges that (A) the Mortgaged
Property does not constitute the sole source of security for the payment and
performance of the Secured Obligations and that the Secured Obligations are also
secured by property of the Mortgagor and its Affiliates in other jurisdictions
(all such property, collectively, the "Collateral"), (B) the number of such
jurisdictions and the nature of the transaction of which this instrument is a
part are such that it would have been impracticable for the parties to allocate
to each item of Collateral a specific loan amount and to execute in respect of
such item a separate credit agreement and (C) the Mortgagor intends that the
Mortgagee have the same rights with respect to the Mortgaged Property, in
foreclosure or otherwise, that the Mortgagee would have had if each item of
Collateral had been secured, mortgaged or pledged pursuant to a separate credit
agreement, mortgage or security instrument. In furtherance of such intent, the
Mortgagor agrees that the Mortgagee may at any time by notice (an "Allocation
Notice") to the Mortgagor allocate a portion (the "Allocated Indebtedness") of
the Secured Obligations to the Mortgaged Property and sever from the remaining
Secured Obligations the Allocated Indebtedness. From and after the giving of an
Allocation Notice with respect to the Mortgaged Property, the Secured
Obligations hereunder shall be limited to the extent set forth in the Allocation
Notice and (as so limited) shall, for all purposes, be construed as a separate
loan obligation of the Mortgagor unrelated to the other transactions
contemplated by the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any document
related to any thereof. To the extent that the proceeds on any foreclosure of
the Mortgaged Property shall exceed the Allocated Indebtedness, such proceeds
shall belong to the Mortgagor and shall not be available hereunder to satisfy
any Secured Obligations of the Mortgagor other than the Allocated Indebtedness.
In any action or proceeding to foreclose the Lien hereof or in connection with
any power of sale, foreclosure or other remedy exercised under this Mortgage
commenced after the giving by the Mortgagee of an Allocation Notice, the
Allocation Notice shall be conclusive proof of the limits of the Secured
Obligations hereby secured, and the Mortgagor may introduce, by way of defense
or counterclaim, evidence thereof in any such action or proceeding.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 13.18, the proceeds received by
the Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage shall be applied by the Mortgagee in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10.3(iii) hereof.

                  (ii)     The Mortgagor hereby waives to the greatest extent
permitted under law the right to a discharge of any of the Secured Obligations
under any statute or rule of law now or hereafter in effect which provides that
foreclosure of the Lien hereof or other remedy exercised under this Mortgage
constitutes the exclusive means for satisfaction of the Secured Obligations or
which makes unavailable a deficiency judgment or any subsequent remedy because
the Mortgagee elected to proceed with a power of sale foreclosure or such other
remedy or because of any failure by the Mortgagee to comply with laws that
prescribe conditions to the entitlement

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

to a deficiency judgment. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing
waiver, any court shall for any reason hold that the Mortgagee is not entitled
to a deficiency judgment, the Mortgagor shall not (A) introduce in any other
jurisdiction such judgment as a defense to enforcement against the Mortgagor of
any remedy in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or (B) seek to
have such judgment recognized or entered in any other jurisdiction, and any such
judgment shall in all events be limited in application only to the state or
jurisdiction where rendered.

                  (iii)    In the event any instrument in addition to the
Allocation Notice is necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
13.18, including, without limitation, any amendment to this Mortgage, any
substitute promissory note or affidavit or certificate of any kind, the
Mortgagee may execute, deliver or record such instrument as the attorney-in-fact
of the Mortgagor. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable.

                  (iv)     Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 14.20 shall be effective only to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

                  SECTION 13.19. Last Dollars Secured. This Mortgage secures
only a portion of the Indebtedness owing or which may become owing by the
Mortgagor. The parties agree that any payments or repayments of such
Indebtedness by the Mortgagor shall be deemed to be applied first to the portion
of the Indebtedness that is not secured hereby, it being the parties' intent
that the portion of the Indebtedness last remaining unpaid shall be secured
thereby.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                    CONCERNING ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS

                  SECTION 6.1. Present Assignment; License to the Grantor.
Section 2.2 of this Deed of Trust constitutes a present, absolute, effective,
irrevocable and complete assignment by Grantor to Beneficiary of the Leases and
Rents and the right, subject to applicable law, to collect all sums payable to
Grantor thereunder and apply the same as Beneficiary may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate (including the payment of reasonable
costs and expenses in connection with the maintenance, operation, improvement,
insurance, taxes and upkeep of the Trust Property), which is not conditioned
upon Beneficiary being in possession of the Premises. The Beneficiary hereby
grants to the Grantor, however, a license to collect and apply the Rents and to
enforce the obligations of Tenants under the Leases. Immediately upon the
occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the license
granted in the immediately preceding sentence shall cease and terminate, with or
without any notice, action or proceeding or the intervention of a receiver
appointed by a court.

                  SECTION 6.2. Collection of Rents by the Beneficiary.

                  (i)      Any Rents receivable by the Beneficiary hereunder,
after payment of all proper costs and expenses as Beneficiary may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate (including the payment of reasonable
costs and expenses in connection with the maintenance, operation, improvement,
insurance, taxes and upkeep of the Trust Property), shall be applied in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10.2 of this Deed of Trust. The
Beneficiary shall be accountable to the Grantor only for Rents actually received
by the Beneficiary. The collection of such Rents and the application thereof
shall not cure or waive any Event of Default or waive, modify or affect notice
of Event of Default or invalidate any act done pursuant to such notice.

                  (ii)     The Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs
Tenant under each Lease to rely upon and comply with any and all notices or
demands from the Beneficiary for payment of Rents to the Beneficiary and the
Grantor shall have no claim against Tenant for Rents paid by Tenant to the
Beneficiary pursuant to such notice or demand.

                  SECTION 6.3. No Release. Neither this Deed of Trust nor any
action or inaction on the part of the Beneficiary shall release Tenant under any
Lease, any guarantor of any Lease or the Grantor from any of their respective
obligations under such Leases or constitute an assumption of any such obligation
on the part of the Beneficiary. No action or failure to act on the part of the
Grantor shall adversely affect or limit the rights of the Beneficiary under this
Deed of Trust or, through this Deed of Trust, under such Leases. Nothing
contained herein shall operate or be construed to (i) obligate the Beneficiary
to perform any of the terms, covenants or conditions contained in any Lease or
otherwise to impose any obligation upon the Beneficiary with respect to such
Lease (including, without limitation, any obligation arising out of any covenant
of quiet enjoyment contained in such Lease in the event that Tenant under such
Lease shall have been joined as a party defendant in any action by which the
estate of such Tenant shall be terminated)

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

or (ii) place upon the Beneficiary any responsibility for the operation,
control, care, management or repair of the Premises.

                  SECTION 6.4. Irrevocable Interest. All rights, powers and
privileges of the Beneficiary herein set forth are coupled with an interest and
are irrevocable, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and the Grantor
shall not take any action under the Leases or otherwise which is inconsistent
with this Deed of Trust or any of the terms hereof and any such action
inconsistent herewith or therewith shall be void.

                  SECTION 6.5. Amendment to Leases. Each Lease, including,
without limitation, all amendments, modifications, supplements, replacements,
extensions and renewals thereof, shall continue to be subject to the provisions
hereof without the necessity of any further act by any of the parties hereto.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                        TAXES AND CERTAIN STATUTORY LIENS

receipts evidencing the payment of all such Charges.

                  SECTION 7.2. Escrow of Taxes. From and after the occurrence of
an Event of Default, at the option and upon the request of the Beneficiary, the
Grantor shall deposit with the Beneficiary in an account maintained by the
Beneficiary (the "Tax Escrow Fund"), on the first day of each month, an amount
estimated by the Beneficiary to be equal to one-twelfth of the annual real
property taxes and other annual Charges required to be discharged by the Grantor
under Section 7.1 hereof. Such amounts shall be held by the Beneficiary without
interest to the Grantor and applied to the payment of the obligations in respect
of which such amounts were deposited, in such priority as the Beneficiary shall
determine, on or before the respective dates on which such obligations or any
part thereof would become delinquent. Nothing contained in this Article VII
shall (i) affect any right or remedy of the Beneficiary under any provision
hereof or of any statute or rule of law to pay any such amount as provided above
from its own funds and to add the amount so paid, together with interest at the
default rate during such time that any amount remains outstanding, to the
Secured Obligations or (ii) relieve the Grantor of its obligations to make or
provide for the payment of the annual real property taxes and other annual
Charges required to be discharged by the Grantor under Section 7.1 hereof.

                  SECTION 7.3. Certain Statutory Liens. Unless and to the extent
contested by the Grantor in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.02 (a)

paid, all lawful claims and demands of mechanics, materialmen, laborers,

judgments, demands or amounts of any nature which, if unpaid, might result in,
or permit the creation of, a Lien on the Trust Property or any part thereof, or
which might result in forfeiture of all or any part of the Trust Property.

                  SECTION 7.4. Stamp and Other Taxes. Unless and to the extent
contested by the Grantor in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII
hereof, the Grantor shall pay any United States documentary stamp taxes, with
interest and fines and penalties, and any mortgage recording taxes, with
interest and fines and penalties, that may hereafter be levied, imposed or
assessed under or upon or by reason hereof or the Secured Obligations or any
instrument or transaction affecting or relating to either thereof and in default
thereof the Beneficiary may advance the same and the amount so advanced shall be
payable by the Grantor to the Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement hereof.

                  SECTION 7.5. Certain Tax Law Changes. In the event of the
passage after the date hereof of any law deducting from the value of real
property, for the purpose of taxation, amounts in respect of any Lien thereon or
changing in any way the laws for the taxation of mortgages or debts secured by
mortgages for state or local purposes or the manner of the collection of any
Charges, and imposing any Charges, either directly or indirectly, on this Deed
of Trust or any other Loan Document, the Grantor shall promptly pay to the
Beneficiary such amount or amounts as may be necessary from time to time to pay
any such Charges.

                  SECTION 7.6. Proceeds of Tax Claim. In the event that the
proceeds of any tax claim are paid after the Beneficiary has exercised its right
to foreclose the Lien hereof, such proceeds shall be paid to the Beneficiary to
satisfy any deficiency remaining after such foreclosure. The Beneficiary shall
retain its interest in the proceeds of any tax claim during any redemption
period. The amount of any such proceeds in excess of any deficiency claim of the
Beneficiary shall in a reasonably prompt manner be released to the Grantor.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                             CONTESTING OF PAYMENTS

                                   ARTICLE IX.

payable in respect of such Destruction are hereby assigned and shall be paid to
the Beneficiary. All Net Insurance such proceeds shall constitute Net Cash
Proceeds under the Credit Agreement and shall be applied in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.2. Condemnation. If there shall occur any Taking or
the commencement of any proceeding therefor, the Grantor shall immediately
notify the Beneficiary upon receiving notice of such Taking or commencement of
proceedings therefor. The Beneficiary may, at its option, participate in any

shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Beneficiary all instruments
requested by it to permit such participation. The Beneficiary may be represented
by counsel satisfactory to it at the expense of the Grantor in connection with
any such participation. The Grantor shall pay all reasonable fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Beneficiary in connection with any Taking and in
seeking and obtaining any award or payment on account thereof. Any proceeds,
award or payment in respect of any Taking are herby assigned and shall be paid
to the Beneficiary. The Grantor shall take all steps necessary to notify the
condemning authority of such assignment. All such proceeds shall constitute Net
Cash Proceeds under the Credit Agreement and shall be applied in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.3. Restoration. In the event the Grantor is

provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement, the proceeds of any award
payable in respect of a Destruction or a Taking shall constitute Net Cash
Proceeds and the Beneficiary shall release such Proceeds to the Grantor in

Agreement, and the Grantor shall complete the restoration in accordance with
provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement. In the event there shall be
any surplus after the application of such proceeds to the Restoration of the
Improvements, such surplus should be applied as Net Cash Proceeds in accordance
with Section 2.10 (e)(iii) of the Credit Agreement.

                         EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

                  SECTION 10.1. Events of Default. It shall be an Event of
Default hereunder if there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of
Default under the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.2. Performance of Defaulted Acts. From and after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Beneficiary
may, but need not, make any payment or perform any act herein required of
Grantor or required in order for there to be compliance with the terms herein or
any other Loan Document, in any form and manner deemed expedient or desirable,
including, without limitation, making full or partial payments for principal or
interest on prior encumbrances (if any), service, utility or maintenance
charges, or insurance premium, curing the default of the landlord under a Lease,
and purchasing, discharging,

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

compromising or settling any tax lien or other prior lien or title or claim
thereof, or redeeming from any tax sale or forfeiture affecting the Trust
Property or contesting any tax assessment. All moneys paid for any of the
purposes herein authorized and all expenses paid or incurred in connection
therewith, including reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be so much additional
Secured Obligations, shall accrue interest at the Default Rate, and together
with such interest, shall become immediately due and payable without notice.
Inaction of Beneficiary shall never be considered as a waiver of any right
accruing to any of them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents on
account of any default on the part of Grantor. Beneficiary making any payment
hereby authorized relating to taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, or service
or utility charges, may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate
procured from the appropriate public office or entity, without inquiry into the
accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax,
assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien, title, claim premium or charge thereof.

                  SECTION 10.3. Rights and Remedies In Case of Event of Default.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Trustee
or Beneficiary may exercise any one or more of the following rights and
remedies:

                  (i)      Beneficiary may declare the entire Secured
Obligations immediately due and payable, including any prepayment penalty which
Grantor would be required to pay, without any presentment, demand, protest or
notice of any kind.

                  (ii)     Trustee shall have the right to foreclose by exercise
of the power of sale contained herein, and Beneficiary shall have the right to
foreclose by judicial foreclosure, in either case, in accordance with applicable
law.

                  (iii)    If this Deed of Trust is foreclosed by judicial
procedure, Beneficiary will be entitled to seek, in accordance with and to the
extent permitted by applicable law, a judgment which will provide that if the
foreclosure sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the judgment, execution
may issue for any amount by which the unpaid balance of the Secured Obligations
secured by this Deed of Trust exceeds the net sale proceeds payable to
Beneficiary.

                  (iv)     Beneficiary shall have the right, without notice to
Grantor to the extent permitted by applicable law, to take possession of the
Trust Property, terminate Grantor's license to collect the Rents, and collect
the Rents, including amounts past due and unpaid, and apply the net proceeds,
over and above Beneficiary's costs, against the Secured Obligations. In
furtherance of this right, Beneficiary may require any Tenant or other use to
make payments of Rents directly to Beneficiary. If the Rents are collected by
Beneficiary, then Grantor irrevocably designates Beneficiary as Grantor's
attorney in fact to endorse instruments received in payment thereof in the name
of Grantor and to negotiate the same and collect the proceeds. Payments by
Tenants or other users to Beneficiary in response to Beneficiary's demand shall
satisfy the obligation for which the payments are made, whether or not any
proper grounds for the demand existed. Beneficiary may exercise its rights under
this sub-section either in person, by agent or through a receiver.

                  SECTION 10.4. Foreclosure by Power of Sale. Should Beneficiary
elect to foreclose by exercise of the power of sale contained herein,
Beneficiary shall notify Trustee and

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

shall, if required, deposit with Trustee the original or a certified copy of
this Deed of Trust and such other documents, receipts and evidences of
expenditures made and secured hereby as Trustee may require

                  (i)      Upon receipt of such notice from Beneficiary, Trustee
shall cause to be recorded and delivered to Grantor such notice of default as
may then be required by law. At the direction of Beneficiary, Trustee shall,
without demand on Grantor, after lapse of such time as may then be required by
law and after recordation of such notice of default and after notice of sale has
been given as required by law, sell the Trust Property at the time and place of
sale fixed by it in said notice of sale, either as a whole or in separate lots
or parcels or items as Trustee shall deem expedient, and in such order as it may
determine, at public auction to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of
the United States payable at the time of sale. Trustee shall deliver to the
purchaser or purchasers at such sale appropriate transfer documents conveying
the property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or implied.
The recitals in such transfer documents of any matters or facts shall be
conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any person, including, without
limitation, Grantor, Trustee or Beneficiary, may purchase at such sale, and
Beneficiary shall be entitled for the purpose of bidding and making settlement
or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Trust Property
sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Secured Obligations as
a credit on account of the purchase price payable by Beneficiary at such sale.
Grantor hereby covenants to warrant and defend the title of such purchaser or
purchasers against every person or party whomsoever claiming or to claim the
same or any part thereof, by, through or under Grantor, subject, however, to the
Permitted Collateral Liens.

                  (ii)     After deducting all reasonable and customary costs,
fees and expenses of Trustee and of this Deed of Trust, including, without
limitation, costs of evidence of title and reasonable attorneys' fees of Trustee
or Beneficiary in connection with a sale as provided in Section 10.4(i) above,
Trustee shall apply the proceeds of such sale: (i) to the payment of all sums
expended under the terms hereof not then repaid, with accrued interest at the
Default Rate; (ii) to the payment of all other sums then secured hereby; and
(iii) the remainder, if any, to the person or persons legally entitled thereto.

                  (iii)    Subject to applicable law, Trustee may postpone the
sale of all or any portion of the Trust Property by public announcement at the
time and place of the scheduled sale, and from time to time thereafter may
postpone such sale by public announcement at the time fixed by the preceding
postponement or subsequent notice of sale, and without further notice may make
such sale at the time fixed by the last postponement, or may, in its discretion,
give a new notice of sale.

                  (iv)     To the fullest extent allowed by law, Grantor hereby
expressly waives any right which it may have to direct the order in which any of
the Trust Property shall be sold in the event of any sale or sales pursuant to
this Deed of Trust.

                  SECTION 10.5. Rescission of Notice of Default. Beneficiary may
from time to time rescind any notice of default or notice of sale before any
Trustee's sale as provided above, by executing and delivering to Trustee a
written notice of such rescission, which such notice,

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

when recorded, shall constitute a cancellation of any prior declaration of
default and demand for sale. The exercise by Beneficiary of such right of
rescission shall not constitute a waiver of any breach or Event of Default then
existing or subsequently occurring, or impair the right of Beneficiary to
execute and deliver to Trustee, as above provided, other declarations or notices
of default to satisfy the Secured Obligations, nor otherwise affect any
provision, covenant or condition of any of the Loan Documents or any of the
rights, Secured Obligations or remedies of Trustee or Beneficiary hereunder or
thereunder.

                  SECTION 10.6. Appointment of Receiver. If an Event of Default
hereunder shall have occurred and be continuing, Beneficiary, as a matter of
right and without notice to Grantor or to anyone claiming under Grantor, and
without regard to the then value of the Trust Property or the interest of
Grantor therein, shall have the right to apply to any court having jurisdiction
to appoint a receiver or receivers of the Trust Property, or any portion
thereof, and Grantor hereby irrevocably consents to such appointment and waives
notice of any application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers shall have
the usual powers and duties of receivers in like or similar cases and all the
powers and duties of Beneficiary in case of entry as provided in Section 4.03(e)
above, and shall continue as such and exercise all such powers until the date of
confirmation of the sale of the Trust Property, unless such receivership is
sooner terminated.

                  SECTION 10.7. Notice to Grantor. Grantor requests that a copy
of any notice of default and of any notice of sale hereunder be mailed to it at
its address hereinbefore set forth. Reasonable notice shall mean notice given at
least ten (10) Business Days before the time of the sale or disposition by
certified or registered mail.

                  SECTION 10.8. Expenses and Application of Proceeds. The costs
and expenses of any Trustee's sale or other foreclosure proceedings shall
include all reasonable expenditures and expenses that may be paid or incurred by
or on behalf of Beneficiary or Trustee for court costs, attorneys' fees,
appraisers' fees, environmental audit fees, outlays for documentary and expert
evidence, stenographers' charges, publication costs, and costs of procuring
abstracts of title, title searches and examinations, title insurance policies
and similar data and assurances with respect to the title as Beneficiary or
Trustee may deem necessary or desirable, either to pursue such sale or civil
action or to evidence to bidders at any sale that may be had the true condition
of the title of, or the value of, the Trust Property. All reasonable
expenditures and expenses of the nature in this Section mentioned and such
expenses and fees as may be incurred in the protection of the Trust Property and
the maintenance of this Deed of Trust, the other Loan Documents or the Trust
Property, including probate, appellate and bankruptcy proceedings, or in
preparations for the commencement or defense of any action or proceeding or
threatened action or proceeding, shall be immediately due and payable by
Grantor, with interest thereon at the rate set forth in the Loan Documents
applicable to a period when a default exists thereunder, shall be secured hereby
and shall be due and payable on demand. The proceeds of any sale of the Trust
Property by Trustee or through other foreclosure proceedings shall be
distributed and applied in the following order of priority: first, on account of
all costs and expenses incident to Trustee's sale or foreclosure proceedings,
including all such items as are mentioned in this Section; second, to all other
items that may under the terms hereof constitute Secured Obligations in
accordance with the Credit Agreement; and third, any excess to Grantor.

                  SECTION 10.9. Rights of Receiver or Beneficiary in Possession.
Upon taking possession of all or any part of the Trust Property following the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and in accordance
with applicable law, a receiver or trustee may:

                  (a)      Use, operate, manage, control and conduct business on
         the Trust Property and make expenditures for all maintenance and
         improvements as in its judgment are proper;

                  (b)      Collect the Rents from the Trust Property and apply
         such sums to the expenses of use, operation and management;

                  (c)      At Beneficiary's option, complete any construction in
         progress on the Trust Property, and in that connection pay bills,
         borrow funds, employ contractors and make any changes in plans or
         specifications as Beneficiary deems appropriate.

                  If the revenues produced by the Trust Property are
insufficient to pay expenses, the receiver may borrow from Beneficiary (if
Beneficiary, in its sole discretion, agrees to lend) or otherwise, or
Beneficiary may borrow or advance, such sums as Beneficiary may deem necessary
for the purposes stated in this Section. The amounts borrowed or advanced shall
bear interest from the date of expenditure until repaid, at the Default Rate.
Such sums shall become a part of the Secured Obligations and shall be payable by
Grantor on demand.

                  SECTION 10.10. Attorneys' Fees; Expenses. Grantor agrees to
reimburse Beneficiary for all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees
that Beneficiary incurs in connection with the realization or enforcement of any
obligation or remedy contained in the Credit Agreement, this Deed of Trust or
any other Loan Document, with or without litigation, including, without
limitation, any reasonable costs, expenses and fees incurred: (a) in any
foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure or trustee's sale;
(b) on appeal; (c) in any petition for review; (d) in any arbitration or
mediation; (e) in any action contesting or seeking to restrain, enjoin, stay or
postpone the exercise of any remedy in which Beneficiary prevails; (f) in any
bankruptcy, probate, receivership or other proceeding involving Grantor; and (g)
in connection with all negotiations, documentation, and other actions relating
to any work-out, compromise, settlement or satisfaction of the Secured
Obligations or settlement of any debt secured by this Deed of Trust or which is
evidenced by the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document. All such costs,
expenses and fees shall be due and payable upon demand, shall bear interest from
the date incurred through the date of collection at the Default Rate.

                  SECTION 10.11. Rights Cumulative. No remedy or right of
Beneficiary shall be exclusive of, but each such remedy or right shall be in
addition to, every other remedy or right now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity. No delay in the exercise or omission to exercise of any remedy or right
accruing on any default shall impair any such remedy or right or be construed to
be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein, nor shall it affect
any subsequent default of the same or a different nature. Every such remedy or
right may be exercised concurrently or independently, and when and as often as
may be deemed expedient by Beneficiary. Grantor agrees that without affecting
the liability of any person for payment of the Secured Obligations or affecting
the Lien of this Deed of Trust upon the Trust Property or any part

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

thereof, Beneficiary, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, may at any time and from time to time, on request of
Grantor, without notice to any person liable for payment of any Secured
Obligations, extend the time or agree to alter the terms of payment of such
indebtedness. Acceptance by Beneficiary of any payment in an amount less than
the amount then due on the Secured Obligations shall be deemed an acceptance on
account only, and the failure to pay the entire amount then due shall continue
to be an Event of Default. At any time thereafter and until the entire amount
then due on the debt has been paid, Beneficiary and the Lenders shall be
entitled to exercise all rights conferred upon them in this Deed of Trust, at
law or in equity, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

                      SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

                  SECTION 11.1. Security Agreement. To the extent that the Trust
Property includes personal property or items of personal property which are or
are to become fixtures under applicable law, this Deed of Trust shall also be
construed as a security agreement under the UCC; and, upon and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Beneficiary shall be entitled with
respect to such personal property to exercise all remedies hereunder, all
remedies available under the UCC with respect to fixtures and all other remedies
available under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, such personal
property may, at the Beneficiary's option, (i) be sold hereunder together with
any sale of any portion of the Trust Property or otherwise, (ii) be sold
pursuant to the UCC, or (iii) be dealt with by the Beneficiary in any other
manner permitted under applicable law. The Beneficiary may require the Grantor
to assemble such personal property and make it available to the Beneficiary at a
place to be designated by the Beneficiary. The Grantor acknowledges and agrees
that a disposition of the personal property in accordance with the Beneficiary's
rights and remedies in respect to the Trust Property as heretofore provided is a
commercially reasonable disposition thereof; provided, however, that the
Beneficiary shall give the Grantor not less than ten (10) days' prior notice of
the time and place of any intended disposition.

                  SECTION 11.2. Fixture Filing. To the extent that the Trust
Property includes items of personal property which are or are to become fixtures
under applicable law, and to the extent permitted under applicable law, the
filing hereof in the real estate records of the county in which such Trust
Property is located shall also operate from the time of filing as a fixture
filing with respect to such Trust Property, and the following information is
applicable for the purpose of such fixture filing, to wit:

   NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE DEBTOR:     NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE SECURED PARTY:

         PROPERTY:

         The Trust Property.

         This instrument covers goods or items of personal property which are or
         are to become fixtures upon the property.

         The name of the record owner of the Property on which such fixtures are
         or are to be located is the Grantor.

In addition, Grantor authorizes the Beneficiary to file appropriate financing
and continuation statements under the UCC in effect in the jurisdiction in which
the Trust Property is located as may be required by law in order to establish,
preserve and protect the liens and security interests intended to be granted to
the Beneficiary pursuant to this Deed of Trust in the Trust Property.

                                  ARTICLE XII.

                               FURTHER ASSURANCES

                  SECTION 12.1. Recording Documentation To Assure Security. The
Grantor shall, forthwith after the execution and delivery hereof and thereafter,
from time to time, cause this Deed of Trust and any financing statement,
continuation statement or similar instrument relating to any thereof or to any
property intended to be subject to the Lien hereof to be filed, registered and
recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by any present or
future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect the validity and
priority thereof or the Lien hereof purported to be created upon the Trust
Property and the interest and rights of the Trustee and Beneficiary therein. The
Grantor shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes and fees incident to such
filing, registration and recording, and all expenses incident to the
preparation, execution and acknowledgment thereof, and of any instrument of
further assurance, and all Federal or state stamp taxes or other taxes, duties
and charges arising out of or in connection with the execution and delivery of
such instruments.

                  SECTION 12.2. Further Acts. The Grantor shall, at the sole
cost and expense of the Grantor, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and
every such further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages, assignments, notices of
assignment, transfers, financing statements, continuation statements,
instruments and assurances as the Trustee or the Beneficiary shall from time to
time request, which may be necessary in the judgment of the Trustee or the
Beneficiary from time to time to assure, perfect, convey, assign, mortgage,
transfer and confirm unto the Trustee and Beneficiary, the property and rights
hereby conveyed or assigned or which the Grantor may be or may hereafter become
bound to convey or assign to the Trustee or the Beneficiary or for carrying out
the intention or facilitating the performance of the terms hereof or the filing,
registering or recording hereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that the Beneficiary desires to exercise any remedies,
consensual rights or attorney-in-fact powers set forth in this Deed of Trust and
determines it necessary to obtain any approvals or consents of any Governmental
Authority or any other person therefor, then, upon the reasonable request of

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

the Beneficiary, the Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to assist and aid
the Beneficiary to obtain as soon as practicable any necessary approvals or
consents for the exercise of any such remedies, rights and powers. In the event
the Grantor shall fail after demand to execute any instrument or take any action
required to be executed or taken by the Grantor under this Section 12.2, the
Beneficiary may execute or take the same as the attorney-in-fact for the
Grantor, such power of attorney being coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable.

                  SECTION 12.3. Additional Security. Without notice to or
consent of the Grantor and without impairment of the Lien and rights created by
this Deed of Trust, the Beneficiary may accept (but the Grantor shall not be
obligated to furnish) from the Grantor or from any other person, additional
security for the Secured Obligations. Neither the giving hereof nor the
acceptance of any such additional security shall prevent the Beneficiary from
resorting, first, to such additional security, and, second, to the security
created by this Deed of Trust without affecting the Beneficiary's Lien and
rights under this Deed of Trust.

                                  ARTICLE XIII.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 13.1. Covenants To Run with the Land. All of the
grants, covenants, terms, provisions and conditions in this Deed of Trust shall
run with the Land and shall apply to, and bind the successors and assigns of,
the Grantor. If there shall be more than one Grantor with respect to the Trust
Property, the covenants and warranties hereof shall be joint and several.

                  SECTION 13.2. No Merger. The rights and estate created by this
Deed of Trust shall not, under any circumstances, be held to have merged into
any other estate or interest now owned or hereafter acquired by the Beneficiary
unless the Beneficiary shall have consented to such merger in writing.

                  SECTION 13.3. Concerning Beneficiary.

                  (i)      The Beneficiary has been appointed as Collateral
Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The actions of the Beneficiary hereunder
are subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Beneficiary shall
have the right hereunder to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or
refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking action
(including, without limitation, the release or substitution of the Trust
Property), in accordance with this Deed of Trust and the Credit Agreement. The
Beneficiary may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection herewith and
shall not be liable for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith. The Beneficiary may resign and a
successor Beneficiary may be appointed in the manner provided in the Credit
Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Beneficiary by a
successor Beneficiary, that successor Beneficiary shall thereupon succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust, and the retiring Beneficiary shall
thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Deed of
Trust.

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

After any retiring Beneficiary's resignation, the provisions hereof shall inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this
Deed of Trust while it was the Beneficiary.

                  (ii)     The Beneficiary shall be deemed to have exercised
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Trust Property in its
possession if such Trust Property is accorded treatment substantially equivalent
to that which the Beneficiary, in its individual capacity, accords its own
property consisting of similar instruments or interests, it being understood
that neither the Beneficiary nor any of the Secured Parties shall have
responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any
person with respect to any Trust Property.

                  (iii)    The Beneficiary shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notice, statement, certificate, order or other document or any telephone
message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper person, and, with respect to all matters pertaining to
this Deed of Trust and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by
it.

                  (iv)     With respect to any of its rights and obligations as
a Lender, the Beneficiary shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers
hereunder. The term "Lenders," "Lender" or any similar terms shall, unless the
context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Beneficiary in its individual
capacity as a Lender. The Beneficiary may accept deposits from, lend money to,
and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the
Grantor or any Affiliate of the Grantor to the same extent as if the Beneficiary
were not acting as Collateral Agent.

                  (v)      If any portion of the Trust Property also constitutes
collateral granted to the Beneficiary under any other deed of trust, mortgage,
security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type, in the event of any
conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of such other deed of
trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type in respect
of such collateral, the Beneficiary, in its sole discretion, shall select which
provision or provisions shall control.

                  SECTION 13.4. Beneficiary May Perform; Beneficiary Appointed
Attorney-in-Fact. If the Grantor shall fail to perform any covenants contained
in this Deed of Trust (including, without limitation, the Grantor's covenants to
(i) pay the premiums in respect of all required insurance policies hereunder or
under the Credit Agreement, (ii) pay Charges, (iii) make repairs, (iv) discharge
Liens or (v) pay or perform any obligations of the Grantor under any Trust
Property) or if any warranty on the part of the Grantor contained herein shall
be breached, the Beneficiary may (but shall not be obligated to), after notice
to Grantor, do the same or cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and
may expend funds for such purpose; provided, however, that the Beneficiary shall
in no event be bound to inquire into the validity of any tax, lien, imposition
or other obligation which the Grantor fails to pay or perform as and when
required hereby and which the Grantor does not contest in accordance with the
provisions of Article VIII hereof. Any and all amounts so expended by the
Beneficiary shall be paid by the Grantor in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement. Neither the provisions of this Section
13.4 nor any action taken by the Beneficiary pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 13.4 shall prevent any such failure to observe any covenant contained in
this Deed of Trust nor any

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

breach of warranty from constituting an Event of Default. The Grantor hereby
appoints the Beneficiary its attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place
and stead of the Grantor and in the name of the Grantor, or otherwise, from time
to time in the Beneficiary's discretion to take any action and to execute any
instrument consistent with the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents which
the Beneficiary may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes
hereof. The foregoing grant of authority is a power of attorney coupled with an
interest and such appointment shall be irrevocable for the term hereof. The
Grantor hereby ratifies all that such attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be
done by virtue hereof.

                  SECTION 13.5. Continuing Security Interest; Assignment. This
Deed of Trust shall create a continuing Lien on and security interest in the
Trust Property and shall (i) be binding upon the Grantor, its successors and
assigns and (ii) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Trustee and
Beneficiary hereunder, to the benefit of the Beneficiary for the benefit of the
Secured Parties and each of their respective successors, transferees and
assigns. No other persons (including, without limitation, any other creditor of
any Loan Party) shall have any interest herein or any right or benefit with
respect hereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (ii),
any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any indebtedness held by it secured
by this Deed of Trust to any other person, and such other person shall thereupon
become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender,
herein or otherwise, subject, however, to the provisions of the Credit
Agreement.

                  SECTION 13.6. Termination; Release. When all the Secured
Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments of the Lenders to make
any Loan or to issue any Letter of Credit under the Credit Agreement shall have
expired or been sooner terminated, this Deed of Trust shall terminate. Upon
termination hereof or any release of the Trust Property or any portion thereof
in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Beneficiary
shall, upon the request and at the sole cost and expense of the Grantor,
forthwith assign, transfer and deliver to the Grantor, against receipt and
without recourse to or warranty by the Beneficiary, such of the Trust Property
to be released (in the case of a release) as may be in possession of the
Beneficiary and as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the
terms hereof, and, with respect to any other Trust Property, proper documents
and instruments (including UCC-3 termination statements or releases)
acknowledging the termination hereof or the release of such Trust Property, as
the case may be.

                  SECTION 13.7. Modification in Writing. No amendment,
modification, supplement, termination or waiver of or to any provision hereof,
nor consent to any departure by the Grantor therefrom, shall be effective unless
the same shall be done in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and
unless in writing and signed by the Beneficiary. Any amendment, modification or
supplement of or to any provision hereof, any waiver of any provision hereof and
any consent to any departure by the Grantor from the terms of any provision
hereof shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is specifically required by
this Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand on the
Grantor in any case shall entitle the Grantor to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  SECTION 13.8. Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein or in
the Credit Agreement, any notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be given in the manner and become effective as set
forth in the Credit Agreement, if to the Grantor or the Beneficiary, addressed
to it at the address set forth in the Credit Agreement, or in each case at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the
other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section 13.8.

                  SECTION 13.9. GOVERNING LAW; SERVICE OF PROCESS; WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL. THIS DEED OF TRUST SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES ARE
LOCATED, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
THAT THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST HEREUNDER, OR REMEDIES
HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT OF ANY PARTICULAR ITEM OR TYPE OF TRUST PROPERTY ARE
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN SUCH STATE. GRANTOR AGREES
THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY PROCEEDING MAY BE EFFECTED BY MAILING A COPY
THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL (OR ANY SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR FORM OF
MAIL), POSTAGE PREPAID, TO BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT
AGREEMENT OR AT SUCH OTHER ADDRESS OF WHICH THE BENEFICIARY SHALL HAVE BEEN
NOTIFIED PURSUANT THERETO. IF ANY AGENT APPOINTED BY GRANTOR REFUSES TO ACCEPT
SERVICE, GRANTOR HEREBY AGREES THAT SERVICE UPON IT BY MAIL SHALL CONSTITUTE
SUFFICIENT NOTICE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF BENEFICIARY TO BRING
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST GRANTOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE GRANTOR
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS DEED OF TRUST OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                  SECTION 13.10. Severability of Provisions. Any provision
hereof which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 13.11. Limitation on Interest Payable. It is the
intention of the parties to conform strictly to the usury laws, whether state or
Federal, that are applicable to the transaction of which this Deed of Trust is a
part. All agreements between the Grantor and the Beneficiary whether now
existing or hereafter arising and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly
limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount paid or
agreed to be paid by the Grantor for the use, forbearance or detention of the
money to be loaned under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for
the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in
the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, exceed the maximum amount
permissible under applicable Federal or state usury laws. If under any
circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any such provision, at the time
performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the limit of
validity prescribed by law, then the

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity. If
under any circumstances the Grantor shall have paid an amount deemed interest by
applicable law, which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount that
would be excessive interest under applicable usury laws shall be applied to the
reduction of the principal amount owing in respect of the Secured Obligations
and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the
unpaid balance of principal and any other amounts due hereunder, the excess
shall be refunded to the Grantor. All sums paid or agreed to be paid for the
use, forbearance or detention of the principal under any extension of credit by
the Beneficiary shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and to the
extent necessary to preclude exceeding the limit of validity prescribed by law,
be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread from the date hereof until payment
in full of the Secured Obligations so that the actual rate of interest on
account of such principal amounts is uniform throughout the term hereof.

                  SECTION 13.12. Business Days. In the event any time period or
any date provided in this Deed of Trust ends or falls on a day other than a
Business Day, then such time period shall be deemed to end and such date shall
be deemed to fall on the next succeeding Business Day, and performance herein
may be made on such Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on
such other day.

                  SECTION 13.13. Relationship. The relationship of the
Beneficiary to the Grantor hereunder is strictly and solely that of lender and
borrower and grantor and beneficiary and nothing contained in the Credit
Agreement, this Deed of Trust or any other document or instrument now existing
and delivered in connection therewith or otherwise in connection with the
Secured Obligations is intended to create, or shall in any event or under any
circumstance be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture,
tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy or other relationship of any nature whatsoever
between the Beneficiary and the Grantor other than as lender and borrower and
grantor and beneficiary.

                  SECTION 13.14. Waiver of Stay.

                  (i)      The Grantor agrees that in the event that the Grantor
or any property or assets of the Grantor shall hereafter become the subject of a
voluntary or involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or the Grantor
shall otherwise be a party to any Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or similar proceeding to which the provisions relating to the
automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision
in any such law is applicable, then, in any such case, whether or not the
Beneficiary has commenced foreclosure proceedings under this Deed of Trust, the
Beneficiary shall be entitled to relief from any such automatic stay as it
relates to the exercise of any of the rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, any foreclosure proceedings) available to the Beneficiary as
provided in this Deed of Trust or in any other Security Document.

                  (ii)     The Beneficiary shall have the right to petition or
move any court having jurisdiction over any proceeding described in Section
13.14 hereof for the purposes provided therein, and the Grantor agrees (i) not
to oppose any such petition or motion and (ii) at the Grantor's sole cost and
expense, to assist and cooperate with the Beneficiary, as may be requested by
the Beneficiary from time to time, in obtaining any relief requested by the
Beneficiary, including,

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

without limitation, by filing any such petitions, supplemental petitions,
requests for relief, documents, instruments or other items from time to time
requested by the Beneficiary or any such court.

                  SECTION 13.15. No Credit for Payment of Taxes or Impositions.
The Grantor shall not be entitled to any credit against the principal, premium,
if any, or interest payable under the Credit Agreement, and the Grantor shall
not be entitled to any credit against any other sums which may become payable
under the terms thereof or hereof, by reason of the payment of any Charge on the
Trust Property or any part thereof.

                  SECTION 13.16. No Claims Against the Beneficiary. Nothing
contained in this Deed of Trust shall constitute any consent or request by the
Beneficiary, express or implied, for the performance of any labor or services or
the furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Premises or
any part thereof, nor as giving the Grantor any right, power or authority to
contract for or permit the performance of any labor or services or the
furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would permit
the making of any claim against the Beneficiary in respect thereof or any claim
that any Lien based on the performance of such labor or services or the
furnishing of any such materials or other property is prior to the Lien hereof.

                  SECTION 13.17. Obligations Absolute. All obligations of the
Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

                  (i)      any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of the
         Grantor or any other Obligor;

                  (ii)     any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
         Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or any other
         agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iii)    any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or
         any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from
         the Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or
         any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iv)     any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other
         Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to any
         departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the Secured
         Obligations;

                  (v)      any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of any
         right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect hereof or any
         other Loan Document except as specifically set forth in a waiver
         granted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.17 hereof; or

                  (vi)     any other circumstances which might otherwise
         constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Grantor.

                  SECTION 13.18. Beneficiary's Right To Sever Indebtedness.

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

                  (i)      The Grantor acknowledges that (A) the Trust Property
does not constitute the sole source of security for the payment and performance
of the Secured Obligations and that the Secured Obligations are also secured by
property of the Grantor and its Affiliates in other jurisdictions (all such
property, collectively, the "Collateral"), (B) the number of such jurisdictions
and the nature of the transaction of which this instrument is a part are such
that it would have been impracticable for the parties to allocate to each item
of Collateral a specific loan amount and to execute in respect of such item a
separate credit agreement and (C) the Grantor intends that the Beneficiary have
the same rights with respect to the Trust Property, in foreclosure or otherwise,
that the Beneficiary would have had if each item of Collateral had been secured,
mortgaged or pledged pursuant to a separate credit agreement, deed of trust or
security instrument. In furtherance of such intent, the Grantor agrees that the
Beneficiary may at any time by notice (an "Allocation Notice") to the Grantor
allocate a portion (the "Allocated Indebtedness") of the Secured Obligations to
the Trust Property and sever from the remaining Secured Obligations the
Allocated Indebtedness. From and after the giving of an Allocation Notice with
respect to the Trust Property, the Secured Obligations hereunder shall be
limited to the extent set forth in the Allocation Notice and (as so limited)
shall, for all purposes, be construed as a separate loan obligation of the
Grantor unrelated to the other transactions contemplated by the Credit
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any document related to any thereof. To
the extent that the proceeds on any foreclosure of the Trust Property shall
exceed the Allocated Indebtedness, such proceeds shall belong to the Grantor and
shall not be available hereunder to satisfy any Secured Obligations of the
Grantor other than the Allocated Indebtedness. In any action or proceeding to
foreclose the Lien hereof or in connection with any power of sale, foreclosure
or other remedy exercised under this Deed of Trust commenced after the giving by
the Beneficiary of an Allocation Notice, the Allocation Notice shall be
conclusive proof of the limits of the Secured Obligations hereby secured, and
the Grantor may introduce, by way of defense or counterclaim, evidence thereof
in any such action or proceeding. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section
13.18, the proceeds received by the Beneficiary pursuant to this Deed of Trust
shall be applied by the Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of Section
10.3(iii) hereof.

                  (ii)     The Grantor hereby waives to the greatest extent
permitted under law the right to a discharge of any of the Secured Obligations
under any statute or rule of law now or hereafter in effect which provides that
foreclosure of the Lien hereof or other remedy exercised under this Deed of
Trust constitutes the exclusive means for satisfaction of the Secured
Obligations or which makes unavailable a deficiency judgment or any subsequent
remedy because the Beneficiary elected to proceed with a power of sale
foreclosure or such other remedy or because of any failure by the Beneficiary to
comply with laws that prescribe conditions to the entitlement to a deficiency
judgment. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, any court
shall for any reason hold that the Beneficiary is not entitled to a deficiency
judgment, the Grantor shall not (A) introduce in any other jurisdiction such
judgment as a defense to enforcement against the Grantor of any remedy in the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or (B) seek to have such judgment
recognized or entered in any other jurisdiction, and any such judgment shall in
all events be limited in application only to the state or jurisdiction where
rendered.

<PAGE>

                  (iii)    In the event any instrument in addition to the
Allocation Notice is necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
13.18, including, without limitation, any amendment to this Deed of Trust, any
substitute promissory note or affidavit or certificate of any kind, the
Beneficiary may execute, deliver or record such instrument as the
attorney-in-fact of the Grantor. Such power of attorney is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable.

                  (iv)     Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 14.20 shall be effective only to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

                  SECTION 13.19. Last Dollars Secured. This Deed of Trust
secures only a portion of the Indebtedness owing or which may become owing by
the Grantor. The parties agree that any payments or repayments of such
Indebtedness by the Grantor shall be deemed to be applied first to the portion
of the Indebtedness that is not secured hereby, it being the parties' intent
that the portion of the Indebtedness last remaining unpaid shall be secured
thereby.

         Lease or sent by Mortgagor thereunder. If for any reason Mortgagor
         cannot timely make any payment under the Mortgaged Lease or perform or
         comply with any of its obligations under the Mortgaged Lease, Mortgagor
         shall notify Mortgagee in sufficient time to enable Mortgagee (but
         Mortgagee shall not be obligated) to timely make such payments and/or
         to perform or comply with such other obligations. On receipt by
         Mortgagee from Mortgagor pursuant to this subsection 3.7(f), or from
         lessor under the Mortgaged Lease, of any such notice of default by, or
         inability to make any payment by, Mortgagor thereunder, Mortgagee may
         rely thereon and, after notice to Mortgagor, take such action as
         Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable to cure such default.

                  (g)      Mortgagor shall not surrender the leasehold estate
         created by the Mortgaged Lease, or terminate or cancel the Mortgaged
         Lease prior to its current expiration date, without the prior consent
         of Mortgagee. Mortgagor shall not, without the prior written consent of
         Mortgagee, amend, modify, surrender, impair, forfeit, cancel or
         terminate, or permit the amendment, modification, surrender,
         impairment, forfeiture, cancellation or termination of, the Mortgaged
         Lease in whole or in part, whether or not a default shall have occurred
         and shall be continuing under either thereof. Any such termination,
         cancellation, modification, change, supplement, alteration, amendment
         or extension without the prior written consent contemplated by this
         subsection 3.7(g) shall be void and of no force or effect; provided,
         however, that Mortgagor shall not have any obligation to renew the
         Mortgaged Lease, exercise any right, if any, to renew the Mortgaged
         Lease or exercise any purchase option, if any, under the Mortgaged
         Lease.

                  (h)      No release or forbearance of any of Mortgagor's
         obligations under the Mortgaged Lease, pursuant to the terms thereof,
         by agreement, operation of law or otherwise, shall release Mortgagor
         from any of Mortgagor's obligations under this Mortgage, including,
         without limitation, the performance of all of the terms, provisions,
         covenants, conditions and agreements contained in the Mortgaged Lease
         to be performed by Mortgagor thereunder; provided, however, that should
         the Mortgaged Lease expire in accordance with the terms thereof, this
         Section 3.7(h) shall not apply.

                  (i)      The leasehold estate of Mortgagor created by the
         Mortgaged Lease and the estate of lessor under the Mortgaged Lease
         shall each at all times remain separate and apart and retain their
         separate identities, and no merger of the leasehold or easement estate
         of Mortgagor with the estate of Lessor will result with respect to
         Mortgagee or with respect to any purchaser acquiring the Mortgaged
         Property at any sale on foreclosure of the Lien of this Mortgage
         without the written consent of Mortgagee. In the event the Mortgagor
         shall acquire a fee interest or other interest in the Mortgaged
         Property, the Mortgagor shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all
         instruments requested by the Mortgagee to confirm the Lien evidenced
         hereby upon such fee estate or other interest

                  (j)      Mortgagor covenants and agrees that the Mortgaged
         Lease now is and shall at all times while the Secured Obligations
         remain outstanding be subject in each and every respect to the terms,
         conditions and Lien of this Mortgage to the extent of Mortgagor's
         leasehold interest in the Mortgaged Lease. Mortgagor shall execute,
         acknowledge and deliver any instruments requested by Mortgagee to
         confirm the foregoing.

                  (k)      Except as required by the Mortgaged Lease, Mortgagor
         shall not subordinate, or consent to the subordination of, the
         Mortgaged Lease to any mortgage or other lien encumbering Landlord's
         estate in the Land.

                  (l)      Mortgagor's obligations under this Mortgage are
         independent of and in addition to Mortgagor's obligations under the
         Mortgaged Lease. Nothing in this mortgage shall be construed to require
         Mortgagor or Mortgagee to take or omit to take any action that would
         cause a default under the Mortgaged Lease.

                  (m)      Mortgagor shall promptly notify Mortgagee after
         learning of the commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization,
         insolvency or similar proceeding affecting Landlord or the occurrence
         of any event that could, with the passage of time, constitute such a
         proceeding. Mortgagor shall also promptly forward to Mortgagee copies
         of any documents, notices, summonses and other documents that Mortgagor
         receives in connection with Landlord's bankruptcy or related
         proceeding.

                  SECTION 3.8. Treatment of Mortgaged Lease in Bankruptcy. (a)
If Landlord under the Mortgage Lease rejects or disaffirms, or seeks or purports
to reject or disaffirm, the Mortgaged Lease pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law, then
Mortgagor shall not exercise the 365(h) Election except as otherwise provided in
this paragraph. To the extent permitted by law, Mortgagor shall not suffer or
permit the termination of any Mortgaged Lease by exercise of the 365(h) Election
or otherwise without Mortgagee's consent. Mortgagor acknowledges that be-

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

cause the Mortgaged Lease is a primary element of Mortgagee's security for the
Secured Obligations, it is not anticipated that Mortgagee would consent to
termination of the Mortgaged Lease. If Mortgagor makes any 365(h) Election in
violation of this Mortgage, then such 365(h) Election shall be void and of no
force or effect.

                  (b)      Mortgagor hereby assigns to Mortgagee the 365(h)
Election with respect to the Mortgaged Lease until the Secured Obligations have
been satisfied in full. Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing
assignment of the 365(h) Election and related rights is one of the rights that
Mortgagee may use at any time to protect and preserve Mortgagee's other rights
and interests under this Mortgage. Mortgagor further acknowledges that exercise
of the 365(h) Election in favor of terminating the Mortgaged Lease would
constitute waste prohibited by this Mortgage.

                  (c)      Mortgagor acknowledges that if the 365(h) Election is
exercised in favor of Mortgagor's remaining in possession under the Mortgaged
Lease, then Mortgagor's resulting occupancy rights, as adjusted by the effect of
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, shall then be part of the Mortgaged Property
and shall be subject to the lien of this Mortgage.

                  SECTION 3.9. Rejection of Mortgaged Lease by Landlord. If
Landlord under the Mortgaged Lease rejects or disaffirms the Mortgaged Lease or
purports or seeks to disaffirm such Mortgaged Lease pursuant to any Bankruptcy
Law, then:

                  (a)      Mortgagor shall remain in possession of the Premises
demised under the Mortgaged Lease and shall perform all acts necessary for
Mortgagor to remain in such possession for the unexpired term of such Mortgaged
Lease, whether the then existing terms and provisions of such Mortgaged Lease
require such acts or otherwise; and

                  (b)      All the terms and provisions of this Mortgage and the
lien created by this Mortgage shall remain in full force and effect and shall
extend automatically to all of Mortgagor's rights and remedies arising at any
time under, or pursuant to, Section 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code, including all
of Mortgagor's rights to remain in possession of the Land.

                  SECTION 3.10. Assignment of Claims to Mortgagee. Mortgagor,
immediately upon learning that Landlord has failed to perform the terms and
provisions under the Mortgaged Lease (including by reason of a rejection or
disaffirmance or purported rejection or disaffirmance of such Mortgaged Lease
pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law), shall notify Mortgagee of any such failure to
perform. Mortgagor unconditionally assigns, transfers, and sets over to
Mortgagee any and all Mortgaged Lease Damage Claims. This assignment constitutes
a present, irrevocable, and unconditional assignment of the Mortgaged Lease
Damage Claims, and shall continue in effect until the Secured Obligations have
been satisfied in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee grants to
Mortgagor a revocable license to exercise any Mortgaged Lease Damage Claims
which license may only be revoked by Mortgagee upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default.

                  SECTION 3.11. New Lease Issued to Mortgagee. If the Mortgaged
Lease is for any reason whatsoever terminated before the expiration of its term
and, pursuant to any provision of the Mortgaged Lease, Mortgagee or its designee
shall acquire from Landlord a new lease of the relevant leased premises, then
Mortgagor shall have no right, title or interest in or to such new lease or the
estate created thereby.

                                  ARTICLE IV.

                         CERTAIN COVENANTS OF MORTGAGOR

                  SECTION 4.1. Payment. The Mortgagor shall pay as and when the
same shall become due, whether at its stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, each and every amount payable by the Mortgagor under the Loan
Documents.

                  SECTION 4.2. Preservation of Existence. The Mortgagor shall
preserve and maintain in full force and effect its qualification to transact
business and good standing in the state in which the Mortgaged Property is
located.

                  SECTION 4.3. Title. The Mortgagor shall

                  (i)      (A) keep in effect all rights and appurtenances to or
         that constitute a part of the Mortgaged Property and (B) protect,
         preserve and defend its interest in the Mortgaged Property and title
         thereto;

                  (ii)     (A) comply with each of the terms, conditions and
         provisions of any obligation of the Mortgagor which is secured by the
         Mortgaged Property or the noncompliance with which may result in the
         imposition of a Lien on the Mortgaged Property, subject to Sections
         6.02 (a), (b) and (e) of the Credit Agreement, (B) forever warrant and
         defend to the Mortgagee the Lien and security interests created and
         evidenced hereby and the validity and priority hereof in any action or
         proceeding against the claims of any and all Persons whomsoever
         affecting or purporting to affect the Mortgaged Property or any of the
         rights of the Mortgagee hereunder and (C) maintain a valid and
         enforceable first priority Lien on the Mortgaged Property and, to the
         extent any of the Mortgaged Property shall consist of Fixtures, a first
         priority security interest in the Mortgaged Property, which first
         priority Lien and security interest shall be subject only to Permitted
         Collateral Liens and all Prior Liens; and

                  (iii)    immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the pendency
         of any proceedings for the eviction of the Mortgagor from the Mortgaged
         Property or any part thereof by paramount title or otherwise
         questioning the Mortgagor's right, title and interest in, to and under
         the Mortgaged Property as warranted in this Mortgage, or of any
         condition that could give rise to any such proceedings, notify the
         Mortgagee thereof. The Mortgagee may participate in such proceedings
         and the Mortgagor will deliver or cause to be delivered to the
         Mortgagee all instruments requested by the Mortgagee to permit such
         partici-

                                      -16-

         pation. In any such proceedings, the Mortgagee may be represented by
         counsel satisfactory to the Mortgagee at the expense of the Mortgagor.
         If, upon the resolution of such proceedings, the Mortgagor shall suffer
         a loss of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof or interest
         therein and title insurance proceeds shall be payable in connection
         therewith, such proceeds are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to
         the Mortgagee to be applied as Net Cash Proceeds to the payment of the
         Secured Obligations or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of
         Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 4.4. Maintenance and Use of Mortgaged Property;
Alterations.

                  (i)      Maintenance. The Mortgagor shall cause the
         representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.3 hereof to
         continue to be true in each and every respect except where the failure
         so to be true would not result in a Property Material Adverse Effect.

                  (ii)     Maintenance of Premises. The Mortgagor shall not
         commit or suffer any waste on the Premises. The Mortgagor shall, at all
         times, comply with the terms of Section 5.03 of the Credit Agreement
         with respect to the maintenance and repair of the Premises (Mortgagor
         acknowledges that the Mortgaged Property is material to the conduct of
         its business). The Mortgagor shall not remove, demolish or alter the
         design or structural character of any Improvement now or hereafter
         erected upon all or any portion of the Premises, or permit any such
         removal, demolition or alteration, without the prior written consent of
         the Mortgagee, unless such removal, demolition, or alteration maintains
         or increases the current value of the Mortgaged Property and in the
         reasonable judgment of Mortgagor, a Prudent Operator would undertake
         such removal, demolition or alteration in order to improve the conduct
         of its business.

                  (iii)    Permits. The Mortgagor shall maintain, or cause to be
         maintained, in full force and effect all Permits contemplated by
         Section 3.3(i) hereof. Unless and to the extent contested by the
         Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof, the
         Mortgagor shall comply in all material respects with all requirements
         set forth in the Permits and all Requirements of Law applicable to all
         or any portion of the Mortgaged Property or the condition, use or
         occupancy of all or any portion thereof or any recorded deed of
         restriction, declaration, covenant running with the land or otherwise,
         now or hereafter in force.

                  (iv)     Zoning. The Mortgagor shall not initiate, join in or
         consent to any change in the zoning or any other permitted use
         classification of the Premises without the prior written consent of the
         Mortgagee.

                  SECTION 4.5. Notices Regarding Certain Defaults. The Mortgagor
shall, promptly upon receipt of any written notice regarding (i) any default by
the Mortgagor relating to the Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof or (ii)

Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof described herein, furnish a copy of
such notice to the Mortgagee.

accordance with Section 5.07 of the Credit Agreement

                  SECTION 4.7. Limitation on Liens; Transfer Restrictions.

Mortgage, the Mortgagor may not, without the prior written consent of the
Mortgagee, further mortgage, encumber, hypothecate, sell, convey or assign all
or any part of the Mortgaged Property or suffer or allow any of the foregoing to
occur by operation of law or otherwise.

                  SECTION 4.8. Estoppel Certificates. The Mortgagor shall, from
time to time, upon ten (10) days' prior written request of the Mortgagee,
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Mortgagee an Officers' Certificate
stating that this Mortgage, the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents
are unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if there have been
modifications, that this Mortgage, the Credit Agreement or such other Credit
Document, as applicable, is in full force and effect as modified and setting
forth such modifications) and stating the date to which principal and interest
have been paid on the Loans.

                  SECTION 4.9. Insurance . The Mortgagor shall obtain and keep
in full force and effect the Insurance Policies required by the Credit Agreement
pursuant to the terms thereof.

                                   ARTICLE V.

                                OCCUPANCY LEASES

                  SECTION 5.1. Mortgagor's Affirmative Covenants with Respect to

         conditions contained in such Lease upon the part of the Tenant
         thereunder to be observed or performed.

                  SECTION 5.2. Mortgagor's Negative Covenants with Respect to
Leases. With respect to each Lease that is hereinafter entered into by
Mortgagor, the Mortgagor shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Mortgagee:

                  (i)      receive or collect, or permit the receipt or
         collection of, any Rent under such Lease more than one (1) month in
         advance of the respective period in respect of which such Rent is to

                           (A)      in connection with the execution and
                                    delivery of such Lease (or of any amendment
                                    to such Lease), Rent thereunder may be
                                    collected and received in advance in an
                                    amount not in excess of one (1) month's
                                    Rent;

                           (B)      the amount held by Landlord as a reasonable
                                    security deposit thereunder; and

                           (C)      any amount received and collected for
                                    escalation and other charges in accordance
                                    with the terms of such Lease;

         Mortgagee thereby Mortgagor unless the same would not cause a Property
         Material Adverse Effect.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                   CONCERNING ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS

                  SECTION 6.1. Present Assignment; License to the Mortgagor.
Section 2.2 of this Mortgage constitutes a present, absolute, effective,
irrevocable and complete assignment by Mortgagor to Mortgagee of the Leases and
Rents and the right, subject to applicable law, to collect all sums payable to
Mortgagor thereunder and apply the same as Mortgagee may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate (including the payment of reasonable
costs and expenses in connection with the maintenance, operation, improvement,
insurance, taxes and upkeep of the Mortgaged Property), which is not conditioned
upon Mortgagee being in possession of the Premises. The Mortgagee hereby grants
to the Mortgagor, however, a license to collect and apply the Rents and to
enforce the obligations of Tenants under the Leases. Immediately upon the
occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the license
granted in the immedi-

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

ately preceding sentence shall cease and terminate, with or without any notice,
action or proceeding or the intervention of a receiver appointed by a court.

                  SECTION 6.2. Collection of Rents by the Mortgagee.

                  (i)      Any Rents receivable by the Mortgagee hereunder,
after payment of all proper costs and expenses as Mortgagee may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate (including the payment of reasonable
costs and expenses in connection with the maintenance, operation, improvement,
insurance, taxes and upkeep of the Mortgaged Property), shall be applied in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10.2 of this Mortgage. The Mortgagee
shall be accountable to the Mortgagor only for Rents actually received by the
Mortgagee. The collection of such Rents and the application thereof shall not
cure or waive any Event of Default or waive, modify or affect notice of Event of
Default or invalidate any act done pursuant to such notice.

                  (ii)     The Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and
directs Tenant under each Lease to rely upon and comply with any and all notices
or demands from the Mortgagee for payment of Rents to the Mortgagee and the
Mortgagor shall have no claim against Tenant for Rents paid by Tenant to the
Mortgagee pursuant to such notice or demand.

                  SECTION 6.3. No Release. Neither this Mortgage nor any action
or inaction on the part of the Mortgagee shall release Tenant under any Lease,
any guarantor of any Lease or the Mortgagor from any of their respective
obligations under such Leases or constitute an assumption of any such obligation
on the part of the Mortgagee. No action or failure to act on the part of the
Mortgagor shall adversely affect or limit the rights of the Mortgagee under this
Mortgage or, through this Mortgage, under such Leases. Nothing contained herein
shall operate or be construed to (i) obligate the Mortgagee to perform any of
the terms, covenants or conditions contained in any Lease or otherwise to impose
any obligation upon the Mortgagee with respect to such Lease (including, without
limitation, any obligation arising out of any covenant of quiet enjoyment
contained in such Lease in the event that Tenant under such Lease shall have
been joined as a party defendant in any action by which the estate of such

theretofor deposited the same with the Landlord thereunder. Such amounts shall
be held by the Mortgagee without interest to the Mortgagor and applied to the

amount remains outstanding, to the Secured Obligations or (ii) relieve the
Mortgagor of its obligations (to the extent it has obligations under the

Mortgagee any amount contemplated in this Section 7.2 if and so long as deposits

contested by the Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.02 (a)

government agencies administering worker's compensation insurance, old age
pensions and social security benefits and all other claims, judgments, demands
or amounts of any nature which, if unpaid, might result in, or permit the
creation of, a Lien on the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, or which
might result in forfeiture of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property.

                  SECTION 7.4. Stamp and Other Taxes. Unless and to the extent
contested by the Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII

mortgages for state or local purposes or the manner of the collection of any
Charges, and imposing any Charges, either directly or indirectly, on this

Mortgagee such amount or amounts as may be necessary from time to time to pay
any such Charges.

                  SECTION 7.6. Proceeds of Tax Claim. In the event that the
proceeds of any tax claim are paid after the Mortgagee has exercised its right
to foreclose the Lien hereof, such proceeds shall be paid to the Mortgagee to
satisfy any deficiency remaining after such foreclosure. The Mortgagee shall
retain its interest in the proceeds of any tax claim during any redemption
period. The amount of any such proceeds in excess of any deficiency claim of the
Mortgagee shall in a reasonably prompt manner be released to the Mortgagor.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

Mortgagee a written notice setting forth the nature and extent of such

Insurance such proceeds shall constitute Net Cash Proceeds under the Credit
Agreement and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10
of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.2. Condemnation. If there shall occur any Taking or
the commencement of any proceeding therefore, the Mortgagor shall immediately
notify the Mortgagee upon receiving notice of such Taking or commencement of
proceedings therefor. The Mortgagee may, at its option, participate in any
proceedings or negotiations which might result in any

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

Taking, and the Mortgagor shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Mortgagee all instruments requested by it to permit such participation. The
Mortgagee may be represented by counsel satisfactory to it at the expense of the
Mortgagor in connection with any such participation. The Mortgagor shall pay all
reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee in connection with
any Taking and in seeking and obtaining any award or payment on account thereof.
Any proceeds, award or payment in respect of any Taking are herby assigned and
shall be paid to the Mortgagee. The Mortgagor shall take all steps necessary to
notify the condemning authority of such assignment. All such proceeds shall
constitute Net Cash Proceeds under the Credit Agreement and shall be applied in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.3. Restoration. In the event the Mortgagor is
permitted or required to perform any Restoration in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement, the proceeds of any award
payable in respect of a Destruction or a Taking shall constitute Net Cash
Proceeds and the Mortgagee shall release such Proceeds to the Mortgagor in
compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit
Agreement, and the Mortgagor shall complete the restoration in accordance with
provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement. In the event there shall be

Improvements, such surplus should be applied as Net Cash Proceeds in accordance

                                   ARTICLE X.

                         EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

                  SECTION 10.1. Events of Default. It shall be an Event of
Default hereunder if there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of
Default under the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.2. Remedies in Case of an Event of Default. If any
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Mortgagee may at its
option, in addition to any other action permitted under this Mortgage or the
Credit Agreement or by law, statute or in equity, take one or more of the
following actions to the greatest extent permitted by local law:

                  (i)      by written notice to the Mortgagor, declare the
         entire unpaid amount of the Secured Obligations to be due and payable
         immediately;

                  (ii)     personally, or by its agents or attorneys, (A) enter
         into and upon and take possession of all or any part of the Premises

         conduct the business thereof, (C) maintain and restore the Premises,
         (D) make all necessary or proper repairs, renewals and replacements and
         such useful Alterations thereto and thereon as the Mortgagee may deem
         advisable, (E) manage, lease and operate the Premises and carry on the
         business thereof and exercise all rights and powers of the Mortgagor
         with re-

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

         spect thereto either in the name of the Mortgagor or otherwise or (F)
         collect and receive all Rents. The Mortgagee shall be under no
         liability for or by reason of any such taking of possession, entry,
         removal or holding, operation or management except that any amounts so
         received by the Mortgagee shall be applied in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement.

                  (iii)    with or without entry, personally or by its agents or
         attorneys, (A) sell the Mortgaged Property and all estate, right, title
         and interest, claim and demand therein at one or more sales in one or
         more parcels, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.3 or (B)
         institute and prosecute proceedings for the complete or partial
         foreclosure of the Lien and security interests created and evidenced
         hereby; or

                  (iv)     take such steps to protect and enforce its rights
         whether by action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity for the
         specific performance of any covenant, condition or agreement in the
         Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in aid of the
         execution of any power granted in this Mortgage, or for any foreclosure
         hereunder, or for the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or
         equitable remedy or otherwise as the Mortgagee shall elect.

                  SECTION 10.3. Sale of Mortgaged Property if Event of Default
Occurs; Proceeds of Sale.

                  (i)      If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Mortgagee may institute an action to foreclose this Mortgage or
take such other action as may be permitted and available to the Mortgagee at law
or in equity for the enforcement of the Credit Agreement and realization on the
Mortgaged Property and proceeds thereon through power of sale (if then available
under applicable law) or to final judgment and execution thereof for the Secured
Obligations, and in furtherance thereof the Mortgagee may sell the Mortgaged
Property at one or more sales, as an entirety or in parcels, at such time and
place, upon such terms and after such notice thereof as may be required or
permitted by law or statute or in equity. The Mortgagee may execute and deliver
to the purchaser at such sale a conveyance of the Mortgaged Property in fee
simple and an assignment or conveyance of all the Mortgagor's Interest in the
Leases and the Mortgaged Property, each of which conveyances and assignments
shall contain recitals as to the Event of Default upon which the execution of
the power of sale herein granted depends, and the Mortgagor hereby constitutes
and appoints the Mortgagee the true and lawful attorney in fact of the Mortgagor
to make any such recitals, sale, assignment and conveyance, and all of the acts
of the Mortgagee as such attorney in fact are hereby ratified and confirmed. The
Mortgagor agrees that such recitals shall be binding and conclusive upon the
Mortgagor and that any assignment or conveyance to be made by the Mortgagee
shall divest the Mortgagor of all right, title, interest, equity and right of
redemption, including any statutory redemption, in and to the Mortgaged
Property. The power and agency hereby granted are coupled with an interest and
are irrevocable by death or dissolution, or otherwise, and are in addition to
any and all other remedies which the Mortgagee may have hereunder, at law or in
equity. So long as the Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, remain unpaid,
the Mortgagor agrees that possession of the Mortgaged Property by the Mortgagor,
or any person claiming under the Mortgagor, shall be as tenant, and, in case of
a sale under power or upon foreclosure as provided in this Mortgage, the

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

Mortgagor and any person in possession under the Mortgagor, as to whose interest
such sale was not made subject, shall, at the option of the purchaser at such
sale, then become and be tenants holding over, and shall forthwith deliver
possession to such purchaser, or be summarily dispossessed in accordance with
the laws applicable to tenants holding over. In case of any sale under this
Mortgage by virtue of the exercise of the powers herein granted, or pursuant to
any order in any judicial proceeding or otherwise, the Mortgaged Property may be
sold as an entirety or in separate parcels in such manner or order as the
Mortgagee in its sole discretion may elect. One or more exercises of powers
herein granted shall not extinguish or exhaust such powers, until the entire
Mortgaged Property is sold or all amounts secured hereby are paid in full.

                  (ii)     In the event of any sale made under or by virtue of
this Article X, the entire principal of, and interest in respect of the Secured
Obligations, if not previously due and payable, shall, at the option of the
Mortgagee, immediately become due and payable, anything in this Mortgage to the
contrary notwithstanding.

                  (iii)    The proceeds of any sale made under or by virtue of
this Article X, together with any other sums which then may be held by the
Mortgagee under this Mortgage, whether under the provisions of this Article X or
otherwise, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.03 of
the Credit Agreement.

                  (iv)     The Mortgagee (on behalf of any Secured Party or on
its own behalf) or any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates may bid for
and acquire the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof at any sale made under or
by virtue of this Article X and, in lieu of paying cash therefor, may make
settlement for the purchase price by crediting against the purchase price the
unpaid amounts (whether or not then due) owing to the Mortgagee, or such Lender
in respect of the Secured Obligations, after deducting from the sales price the
expense of the sale and the reasonable costs of the action or proceedings and
any other sums that the Mortgagee or such Lender is authorized to deduct under
this Mortgage.

                  (v)      The Mortgagee may adjourn from time to time any sale
by it to be made under or by virtue hereof by announcement at the time and place
appointed for such sale or for such adjourned sale or sales, and, the Mortgagee,
without further notice or publication, may make such sale at the time and place
to which the same shall be so adjourned.

                  (vi)     If the Premises is comprised of more than one parcel
of land, the Mortgagee may take any of the actions authorized by this Section
10.3 in respect of any or a number of individual parcels.

                  SECTION 10.4. Additional Remedies in Case of an Event of
Default.

                  (i)      The Mortgagee shall be entitled to recover judgment
as aforesaid either before, after or during the pendency of any proceedings for
the enforcement of the provisions hereof, and the right of the Mortgagee to
recover such judgment shall not be affected by any entry or sale hereunder, or
by the exercise of any other right, power or remedy for the enforcement of the
provisions hereof, or the foreclosure of, or absolute conveyance pursuant to,
this Mortgage. In case of proceedings against the Mortgagor in insolvency or
bankruptcy or any proceed-

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

ings for its reorganization or involving the liquidation of its assets, the
Mortgagee shall be entitled to prove the whole amount of principal and interest
and other payments, charges and costs due in respect of the Secured Obligations
to the full amount thereof without deducting therefrom any proceeds obtained
from the sale of the whole or any part of the Mortgaged Property; provided,
however, that in no case shall the Mortgagee receive a greater amount than the
aggregate of such principal, interest and such other payments, charges and costs
(with interest at the default rate) from the proceeds of the sale of the
Mortgaged Property and the distribution from the estate of the Mortgagor.

                  (ii)     Any recovery of any judgment by the Mortgagee and any
levy of any execution under any judgment upon the Mortgaged Property shall not
affect in any manner or to any extent the Lien and security interests created
and evidenced hereby upon the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, or any
conveyances, powers, rights and remedies of the Mortgagee hereunder, but such
conveyances, powers, rights and remedies shall continue unimpaired as before.

                  (iii)    Any monies collected by the Mortgagee under this
Section 10.4 shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section
10.3(iii).

                  SECTION 10.5. Legal Proceedings After an Event of Default.

                  (i)      After the occurrence of any Event of Default and
immediately upon the commencement of any action, suit or legal proceedings to
obtain judgment for the Secured Obligations or any part thereof, or of any
proceedings to foreclose the Lien and security interest created and evidenced
hereby or otherwise enforce the provisions hereof or of any other proceedings in
aid of the enforcement hereof, the Mortgagor shall enter its voluntary
appearance in such action, suit or proceeding.

                  (ii)     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall be entitled forthwith as a matter of
right, concurrently or independently of any other right or remedy hereunder
either before or after declaring the Secured Obligations or any part thereof to
be due and payable, to the appointment of a receiver without giving notice to
any party and without regard to the adequacy or inadequacy of any security for
the Secured Obligations or the solvency or insolvency of any person or entity
then legally or equitably liable for the Secured Obligations or any portion
thereof. The Mortgagor hereby consents to the appointment of such receiver.
Notwithstanding the appointment of any receiver, the Mortgagee shall be entitled
as pledgee to the possession and control of any cash, deposits or instruments at
the time held by or payable or deliverable under the terms of the Credit
Agreement to the Mortgagee.

                  (iii)    The Mortgagor shall not (A) at any time insist upon,
or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take any benefit or advantage of
any stay or extension or moratorium law, any exemption from execution or sale of
the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, wherever enacted, now or at any time
hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants and terms of performance
hereof, (B) claim, take or insist on any benefit or advantage of any law now or
hereafter in force providing for the valuation or appraisal of the Mortgaged
Property, or any part thereof, prior to any sale or sales of the Mortgaged
Property which may be made pursuant to this Mortgage, or pursuant to any decree,
judgment or order of any court of competent ju-

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

risdiction or (C) after any such sale or sales, claim or exercise any right
under any statute heretofore or hereafter enacted to redeem the property so sold
or any part thereof. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Mortgagor
hereby expressly (A) waives all benefit or advantage of any such law or laws,
including, without limitation, any statute of limitations applicable to this
Mortgage, (B) waives any and all rights to trial by jury in any action or
proceeding related to the enforcement hereof, (C) waives any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action, suit or
proceeding brought in connection with this Mortgage and further waives and
agrees not to plead that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (D) covenants not to hinder,
delay or impede the execution of any power granted or delegated to the Mortgagee
by this Mortgage but to suffer and permit the execution of every such power as
though no such law or laws had been made or enacted. The Mortgagee shall not be
liable for any incorrect or improper payment made pursuant to this Article X in
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  SECTION 10.6. Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy conferred upon
or reserved to the Mortgagee by this Mortgage is intended to be exclusive of any
other remedy or remedies, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and
shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Mortgage or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity. Any delay or omission of the Mortgagee
to exercise any right or power accruing on any Event of Default shall not impair
any such right or power and shall not be construed to be a waiver of or
acquiescence in any such Event of Default. Every power and remedy given by this
Mortgage may be exercised from time to time concurrently or independently, when
and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Mortgagee in such order and
manner as the Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, may elect. If the Mortgagee
accepts any monies required to be paid by the Mortgagor under this Mortgage
after the same become due, such acceptance shall not constitute a waiver of the
right either to require prompt payment, when due, of all other sums secured by
this Mortgage or to declare an Event of Default with regard to subsequent
defaults. If the Mortgagee accepts any monies required to be paid by the
Mortgagor under this Mortgage in an amount less than the sum then due, such
acceptance shall be deemed an acceptance on account only and on the condition
that it shall not constitute a waiver of the obligation of the Mortgagor to pay
the entire sum then due, and the Mortgagor's failure to pay the entire sum then
due shall be and continue to be a default hereunder notwithstanding acceptance
of such amount on account.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

                      SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

                  SECTION 11.1. Security Agreement. To the extent that the
Mortgaged Property includes personal property or items of personal property
which are or are to become fixtures under applicable law, this Mortgage shall
also be construed as a security agreement under the UCC; and, upon and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall be entitled with
respect to such personal property to exercise all remedies hereunder, all
remedies available under the UCC with respect to fixtures and all other remedies
available under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, such personal
property may, at the Mortgagee's option,

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

(i) be sold hereunder together with any sale of any portion of the Mortgaged
Property or otherwise, (ii) be sold pursuant to the UCC, or (iii) be dealt with
by the Mortgagee in any other manner permitted under applicable law. The
Mortgagee may require the Mortgagor to assemble such personal property and make
it available to the Mortgagee at a place to be designated by the Mortgagee. The
Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the personal property in
accordance with the Mortgagee's rights and remedies in respect to the Mortgaged
Property as heretofore provided is a commercially reasonable disposition
thereof; provided, however, that the Mortgagee shall give the Mortgagor not less
than ten (10) days' prior notice of the time and place of any intended
disposition.

                  SECTION 11.2. Fixture Filing. To the extent that the Mortgaged
Property includes items of personal property which are or are to become fixtures
under applicable law, and to the extent permitted under applicable law, the
filing hereof in the real estate records of the county in which such Mortgaged
Property is located shall also operate from the time of filing as a fixture
filing with respect to such Mortgaged Property, and the following information is
applicable for the purpose of such fixture filing, to wit:

execution and delivery of such instruments.

                  SECTION 12.2. Further Acts. The Mortgagor shall, at the sole
cost and expense of the Mortgagor, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and
every such further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages, assignments, notices of
assignment, transfers, financing statements, continuation statements,
instruments and assurances as the Mortgagee shall from time to time request,
which may be necessary in the judgment of the Mortgagee from time to time to
assure, perfect, convey, assign, mortgage, transfer and confirm unto the
Mortgagee, the property and rights hereby conveyed or assigned or which the
Mortgagor may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or assign to the
Mortgagee or for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of
the terms hereof or the filing, registering or recording hereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Mortgagee
desires to exercise any remedies, consensual rights or attorney-in-fact powers
set forth in this Mortgage and determines it necessary to obtain any approvals
or consents of any Governmental Authority or any other Person therefor, then,
upon the reasonable request of the Mortgagee, the Mortgagor agrees to use its
best efforts to assist and aid the Mortgagee to obtain as soon as practicable
any necessary approvals or consents for the exercise of any such remedies,
rights and powers. In the event the Mortgagor shall fail after demand to execute
any instrument or take any action required to be executed or taken by the
Mortgagor under this Section 12.2, the Mortgagee may execute or take the same as
the attorney-in-fact for the Mortgagor, such power of attorney being coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable.

                  SECTION 12.3. Additional Security. Without notice to or
consent of the Mortgagor and without impairment of the Lien and rights created
by this Mortgage, the Mortgagee may accept (but the Mortgagor shall not be
obligated to furnish) from the Mortgagor or from any other Person, additional
security for the Secured Obligations. Neither the giving hereof nor the
acceptance of any such additional security shall prevent the Mortgagee from
resorting, first, to such additional security, and, second, to the security
created by this Mortgage without affecting the Mortgagee's Lien and rights under
this Mortgage.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 13.1. Covenants To Run with the Land. All of the
grants, covenants, terms, provisions and conditions in this Mortgage shall run
with the Land and shall apply to, and bind the successors and assigns of, the
Mortgagor. If there shall be more than one mortgagor with respect to the
Mortgaged Property, the covenants and warranties hereof shall be joint and
several.

                  SECTION 13.2. No Merger. The rights and estate created by this
Mortgage shall not, under any circumstances, be held to have merged into any
other estate or interest now owned or hereafter acquired by the Mortgagee unless
the Mortgagee shall have consented to such merger in writing.

                  SECTION 13.3. Concerning Mortgagee.

                  (i)      The Mortgagee has been appointed as Collateral Agent
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The actions of the Mortgagee hereunder are
subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Mortgagee shall have the
right hereunder to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking action (including,
without limitation, the release or substitution of the Mortgaged Property), in
accordance with this Mortgage and the Credit Agreement. The Mortgagee may employ
agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection herewith and shall not be liable for
the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
it in good faith. The Mortgagee may resign and a successor Mortgagee may be
appointed in the manner provided in the Credit Agreement. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as the Mortgagee by a successor Mortgagee, that successor
Mortgagee shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Mortgagee under this Mortgage, and
the retiring Mortgagee shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Mortgage. After any retiring Mortgagee's resignation, the
provisions hereof shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it under this Mortgage while it was the Mortgagee.

                  (ii)     The Mortgagee shall be deemed to have exercised
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Mortgaged Property in its
possession if such Mortgaged Property is accorded treatment substantially
equivalent to that which the Mortgagee, in its individual capacity, accords its
own property consisting of similar instruments or interests, it being understood
that neither the Mortgagee nor any of the Secured Parties shall have
responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any
Person with respect to any Mortgaged Property.

                  (iii)    The Mortgagee shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notice, statement, certificate, order or other document or any telephone
message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper person, and, with respect to all matters pertaining to
this Mortgage and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.

<PAGE>

                  (iv)     With respect to any of its rights and obligations as
a Lender, the Mortgagee shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers
hereunder. The term "Lenders," "Lender" or any similar terms shall, unless the
context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Mortgagee in its individual
capacity as a Lender. The Mortgagee may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the
Mortgagor or any Affiliate of the Mortgagor to the same extent as if the
Mortgagee were not acting as Collateral Agent.

                  (v)      If any portion of the Mortgaged Property also
constitutes collateral granted to the Mortgagee under any other deed of trust,
mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type, in the event of
any conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of such other deed
of trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type in
respect of such collateral, the Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, shall select
which provision or provisions shall control.

                  SECTION 13.4. Mortgagee May Perform; Mortgagee Appointed
Attorney-in-Fact. If the Mortgagor shall fail to perform any covenants contained
in this Mortgage (including, without limitation, the Mortgagor's covenants to
(i) pay the premiums in respect of all required insurance policies hereunder or
under the Credit Agreement, (ii) pay Charges, (iii) make repairs, (iv) discharge
Liens or (v) pay or perform any obligations of the Mortgagor under any Mortgaged
Property) or if any warranty on the part of the Mortgagor contained herein shall
be breached, the Mortgagee may (but shall not be obligated to), after notice to
Mortgagor, do the same or cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and may
expend funds for such purpose; provided, however, that the Mortgagee shall in no
event be bound to inquire into the validity of any tax, lien, imposition or
other obligation which the Mortgagor fails to pay or perform as and when
required hereby and which the Mortgagor does not contest in accordance with the
provisions of Article VIII hereof. Any and all amounts so expended by the
Mortgagee shall be paid by the Mortgagor in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement. Neither the provisions of this Section
13.4 nor any action taken by the Mortgagee pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 13.4 shall prevent any such failure to observe any covenant contained in
this Mortgage nor any breach of warranty from constituting an Event of Default.
The Mortgagor hereby appoints the Mortgagee its attorney-in-fact, with full
authority in the place and stead of the Mortgagor and in the name of the
Mortgagor, or otherwise, from time to time in the Mortgagee's discretion to take
any action and to execute any instrument consistent with the terms hereof and
the other Loan Documents which the Mortgagee may deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes hereof. The foregoing grant of authority is a power of
attorney coupled with an interest and such appointment shall be irrevocable for
the term hereof. The Mortgagor hereby ratifies all that such attorney shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.

                  SECTION 13.5. Continuing Security Interest; Assignment. This
Mortgage shall create a continuing Lien on and security interest in the
Mortgaged Property and shall (i) be binding upon the Mortgagor, its successors
and assigns and (ii) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the
Mortgagee hereunder, to the benefit of the Mortgagee for the benefit of the
Secured Parties and each of their respective successors, transferees and
assigns. No other Persons (including, without limitation, any other creditor of
any Loan Party) shall have any interest herein or any right or benefit with
respect hereto. Without limiting the generality of the forego-

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

ing clause (ii), any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any indebtedness
held by it secured by this Mortgage to any other Person, and such other Person
shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted
to such Lender, herein or otherwise, subject, however, to the provisions of the
Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 13.6. Termination; Release. When all the Secured
Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments of the Lenders to make
any Loan or to issue any Letter of Credit under the Credit Agreement shall have
expired or been sooner terminated, this Mortgage shall terminate. Upon
termination hereof or any release of the Mortgaged Property or any portion
thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Mortgagee
shall, upon the request and at the sole cost and expense of the Mortgagor,
forthwith assign, transfer and deliver to the Mortgagor, against receipt and
without recourse to or warranty by the Mortgagee, such of the Mortgaged Property
to be released (in the case of a release) as may be in possession of the
Mortgagee and as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the
terms hereof, and, with respect to any other Mortgaged Property, proper
documents and instruments (including UCC-3 termination statements or releases)
acknowledging the termination hereof or the release of such Mortgaged Property,
as the case may be.

                  SECTION 13.7. Modification in Writing. No amendment,
modification, supplement, termination or waiver of or to any provision hereof,
nor consent to any departure by the Mortgagor therefrom, shall be effective
unless the same shall be done in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement and unless in writing and signed by the Mortgagee. Any amendment,
modification or supplement of or to any provision hereof, any waiver of any
provision hereof and any consent to any departure by the Mortgagor from the
terms of any provision hereof shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is
specifically required by this Mortgage or any other Loan Document, no notice to
or demand on the Mortgagor in any case shall entitle the Mortgagor to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  SECTION 13.8. Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein or in
the Credit Agreement, any notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be given in the manner and become effective as set
forth in the Credit Agreement, if to the Mortgagor or the Mortgagee, addressed
to it at the address set forth in the Credit Agreement, or in each case at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the
other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section 13.8.

                  SECTION 13.9. GOVERNING LAW; SERVICE OF PROCESS; WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL. THIS MORTGAGE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES ARE
LOCATED, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
THAT THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF THE SECURITY INTEREST HEREUNDER, OR REMEDIES
HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT OF ANY PARTICULAR ITEM OR TYPE OF MORTGAGED PROPERTY ARE
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN SUCH STATE. MORTGAGOR AGREES
THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY PROCEEDING MAY BE EFFECTED BY MAILING A COPY
THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

(OR ANY SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR FORM OF MAIL), POSTAGE PREPAID, TO BORROWER AT ITS
ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR AT SUCH OTHER ADDRESS OF WHICH THE
MORTGAGEE SHALL HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED PURSUANT THERETO. IF ANY AGENT APPOINTED BY
MORTGAGOR REFUSES TO ACCEPT SERVICE, MORTGAGOR HEREBY AGREES THAT SERVICE UPON
IT BY MAIL SHALL CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT NOTICE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE
RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL LIMIT THE
RIGHT OF MORTGAGEE TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST MORTGAGOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION. THE MORTGAGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS MORTGAGE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                  SECTION 13.10. Severability of Provisions. Any provision
hereof which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 13.11. Limitation on Interest Payable. It is the
intention of the parties to conform strictly to the usury laws, whether state or
Federal, that are applicable to the transaction of which this Mortgage is a
part. All agreements between the Mortgagor and the Mortgagee whether now
existing or hereafter arising and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly
limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the amount paid or
agreed to be paid by the Mortgagor for the use, forbearance or detention of the
money to be loaned under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for
the payment or performance of any covenant or obligation contained herein or in
the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, exceed the maximum amount
permissible under applicable Federal or state usury laws. If under any
circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any such provision, at the time
performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the limit of
validity prescribed by law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced
to the limit of such validity. If under any circumstances the Mortgagor shall
have paid an amount deemed interest by applicable law, which would exceed the
highest lawful rate, such amount that would be excessive interest under
applicable usury laws shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount
owing in respect of the Secured Obligations and not to the payment of interest,
or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal and any
other amounts due hereunder, the excess shall be refunded to the Mortgagor. All
sums paid or agreed to be paid for the use, forbearance or detention of the
principal under any extension of credit by the Mortgagee shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, and to the extent necessary to preclude exceeding
the limit of validity prescribed by law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and
spread from the date hereof until payment in full of the Secured Obligations so
that the actual rate of interest on account of such principal amounts is uniform
throughout the term hereof.

                  SECTION 13.12. Business Days. In the event any time period or
any date provided in this Mortgage ends or falls on a day other than a Business
Day, then such time period shall be deemed to end and such date shall be deemed
to fall on the next succeeding Business

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

Day, and performance herein may be made on such Business Day, with the same
force and effect as if made on such other day.

                  SECTION 13.13. Relationship. The relationship of the Mortgagee
to the Mortgagor hereunder is strictly and solely that of lender and borrower
and mortgagor and mortgagee and nothing contained in the Credit Agreement, this
Mortgage or any other document or instrument now existing and delivered in
connection therewith or otherwise in connection with the Secured Obligations is
intended to create, or shall in any event or under any circumstance be construed
as creating a partnership, joint venture, tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy or
other relationship of any nature whatsoever between the Mortgagee and the
Mortgagor other than as lender and borrower and mortgagor and mortgagee.

                  SECTION 13.14. Waiver of Stay.

                  (i)      The Mortgagor agrees that in the event that the
Mortgagor or any property or assets of the Mortgagor shall hereafter become the
subject of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or
the Mortgagor shall otherwise be a party to any Federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or similar proceeding to which the provisions relating to
the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar
provision in any such law is applicable, then, in any such case, whether or not
the Mortgagee has commenced foreclosure proceedings under this Mortgage, the
Mortgagee shall be entitled to relief from any such automatic stay as it relates
to the exercise of any of the rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, any foreclosure proceedings) available to the Mortgagee as provided
in this Mortgage or in any other Security Document.

                  (ii)     The Mortgagee shall have the right to petition or
move any court having jurisdiction over any proceeding described in Section
13.14 hereof for the purposes provided therein, and the Mortgagor agrees (i) not
to oppose any such petition or motion and (ii) at the Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense, to assist and cooperate with the Mortgagee, as may be requested by the
Mortgagee from time to time, in obtaining any relief requested by the Mortgagee,
including, without limitation, by filing any such petitions, supplemental
petitions, requests for relief, documents, instruments or other items from time
to time requested by the Mortgagee or any such court.

                  SECTION 13.15. No Credit for Payment of Taxes or Impositions.
The Mortgagor shall not be entitled to any credit against the principal,
premium, if any, or interest payable under the Credit Agreement, and the
Mortgagor shall not be entitled to any credit against any other sums which may
become payable under the terms thereof or hereof, by reason of the payment of
any Charge on the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof.

                  SECTION 13.16. No Claims Against the Mortgagee. Nothing
contained in this Mortgage shall constitute any consent or request by the
Mortgagee, express or implied, for the performance of any labor or services or
the furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the Premises or
any part thereof, nor as giving the Mortgagor any right, power or authority to
contract for or permit the performance of any labor or services or the
furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as would permit
the making of any claim against the

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

Mortgagee in respect thereof or any claim that any Lien based on the performance
of such labor or services or the furnishing of any such materials or other
property is prior to the Lien hereof.

                  SECTION 13.17. Obligations Absolute. All obligations of the
Mortgagor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

                  (i)      any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of the
         Mortgagor or any other Obligor;

                  (ii)     any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
         Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or any other
         agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iii)    any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or
         any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from
         the Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or
         any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iv)     any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other
         Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to any
         departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the Secured
         Obligations;

                  (v)      any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver of any
         right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect hereof or any
         other Loan Document except as specifically set forth in a waiver
         granted pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.17 hereof; or

                  (vi)     any other circumstances which might otherwise
         constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Mortgagor.

                  SECTION 13.18. Mortgagee's Right To Sever Indebtedness.

                  (i)      The Mortgagor acknowledges that (A) the Mortgaged
Property does not constitute the sole source of security for the payment and
performance of the Secured Obligations and that the Secured Obligations are also
secured by property of the Mortgagor and its Affiliates in other jurisdictions
(all such property, collectively, the "Collateral"), (B) the number of such
jurisdictions and the nature of the transaction of which this instrument is a
part are such that it would have been impracticable for the parties to allocate
to each item of Collateral a specific loan amount and to execute in respect of
such item a separate credit agreement and (C) the Mortgagor intends that the
Mortgagee have the same rights with respect to the Mortgaged Property, in
foreclosure or otherwise, that the Mortgagee would have had if each item of
Collateral had been secured, mortgaged or pledged pursuant to a separate credit
agreement, mortgage or security instrument. In furtherance of such intent, the
Mortgagor agrees that the Mortgagee may at any time by notice (an "Allocation
Notice") to the Mortgagor allocate a portion (the "Allocated Indebtedness") of
the Secured Obligations to the Mortgaged Property and sever from the remaining
Secured Obligations the Allocated Indebtedness. From and after the giving of an
Allocation Notice with respect to the Mortgaged Property, the Secured
Obligations hereunder shall be limited

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

to the extent set forth in the Allocation Notice and (as so limited) shall, for
all purposes, be construed as a separate loan obligation of the Mortgagor
unrelated to the other transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any document related to any thereof. To the extent that
the proceeds on any foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property shall exceed the
Allocated Indebtedness, such proceeds shall belong to the Mortgagor and shall
not be available hereunder to satisfy any Secured Obligations of the Mortgagor
other than the Allocated Indebtedness. In any action or proceeding to foreclose
the Lien hereof or in connection with any power of sale, foreclosure or other
remedy exercised under this Mortgage commenced after the giving by the Mortgagee
of an Allocation Notice, the Allocation Notice shall be conclusive proof of the
limits of the Secured Obligations hereby secured, and the Mortgagor may
introduce, by way of defense or counterclaim, evidence thereof in any such
action or proceeding. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 13.18, the
proceeds received by the Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage shall be applied by
the Mortgagee in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.3(iii) hereof.

                  (ii)     The Mortgagor hereby waives to the greatest extent
permitted under law the right to a discharge of any of the Secured Obligations
under any statute or rule of law now or hereafter in effect which provides that
foreclosure of the Lien hereof or other remedy exercised under this Mortgage
constitutes the exclusive means for satisfaction of the Secured Obligations or
which makes unavailable a deficiency judgment or any subsequent remedy because
the Mortgagee elected to proceed with a power of sale foreclosure or such other
remedy or because of any failure by the Mortgagee to comply with laws that
prescribe conditions to the entitlement to a deficiency judgment. In the event
that, notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, any court shall for any reason hold
that the Mortgagee is not entitled to a deficiency judgment, the Mortgagor shall
not (A) introduce in any other jurisdiction such judgment as a defense to
enforcement against the Mortgagor of any remedy in the Credit Agreement or any
other Loan Document or (B) seek to have such judgment recognized or entered in
any other jurisdiction, and any such judgment shall in all events be limited in
application only to the state or jurisdiction where rendered.

                  (iii)    In the event any instrument in addition to the
Allocation Notice is necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
13.18, including, without limitation, any amendment to this Mortgage, any
substitute promissory note or affidavit or certificate of any kind, the
Mortgagee may execute, deliver or record such instrument as the attorney-in-fact
of the Mortgagor. Such power of attorney is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable.

                  (iv)     Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 14.20 shall be effective only to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

                  SECTION 13.19. Last Dollars Secured. This Mortgage secures
only a portion of the Indebtedness owing or which may become owing by the
Mortgagor. The parties agree that any payments or repayments of such
Indebtedness by the Mortgagor shall be deemed to be applied first to the portion
of the Indebtedness that is not secured hereby, it being the parties' intent
that the portion of the Indebtedness last remaining unpaid shall be secured
thereby.

further action as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of
obtaining or preserving the full benefits of this Agreement and the rights and
powers herein granted, including the filing of any financing statements,
continuation statements and other documents (including this Agreement) under the

         Collateral shall be evidenced by any Instrument or Tangible Chattel
         Paper, and such amount, together with all amounts payable evidenced by
         any Instrument or Tangible Chattel Paper not previously delivered to
         the Collateral Agent exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate for all
         Pledgors, the Pledgor acquiring such Instrument or Tangible Chattel
         Paper shall forthwith endorse, assign and deliver the same to the

         disposition of funds from time to time credited to any Deposit Account
         or withhold any withdrawal rights from such Pledgor with respect to
         funds from time to time credited to any Deposit Account unless an Event
         of Default has occurred and is continuing. No Pledgor shall grant
         Control of any Deposit Account to any person other than the Collateral
         Agent.

                  (ii)     If any Pledgor shall at any time hold or acquire any
         certificated securities constituting Investment Property other than any
         certificated securities that are expressly permitted to be excluded
         from the Pledged Collateral pursuant to Section 5.11(b) of the Credit

         substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent or (b)
         deliver such securities into a Securities Account with respect to which

         any securities now or hereafter acquired by any Pledgor constituting
         Investment Property other than any securities that that are expressly
         permitted to be excluded from the Pledged Collateral pursuant to
         Section 5.11(b) of the Credit Agreement are uncertificated and are
         issued to such Pledgor or its nominee directly by the issuer thereof,
         such Pledgor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and
         pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
         to the Collateral Agent, either (a) cause the issuer to agree to comply

         Security Entitlement with respect to such uncertificated security to be
         held in a Securities Account with respect to which the Collateral Agent
         has Control or (c) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the
         registered owner of the securities. Pledgor shall not hereafter
         establish or maintain any Securities Account or Commodity Account with
         any Securities Intermediary or Commodity Intermediary unless (1) the
         applicable Pledgor shall have given the Collateral Agent 30 days' prior
         written notice of its intention to establish such new Securities
         Account or Commodity Account with such Securities Intermediary or

         or such Investment Property and any new securities, instruments,
         documents or other property by reason of ownership of such Investment
         Property (other than payments of a kind described in Section 7.4
         hereof) received by it into a Controlled Account. The Collateral Agent
         agrees with each Pledgor that the Collateral Agent shall not give any
         Entitlement Orders or instructions or directions to any issuer of
         uncertificated securities, Securities Intermediary or Commodity
         Intermediary, and shall not withhold its consent to the exercise of any
         withdrawal or dealing rights by such Pledgor, unless an Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, or, after giving effect to any
         such investment and withdrawal rights would occur. No Pledgor shall
         grant control over any Investment Property to any person other than the
         Collateral Agent.

                  (iii)    As between the Collateral Agent and the Pledgors, the
         Pledgors shall bear the investment risk with respect to the Investment
         Property and Pledged Securities, and the risk of loss of, damage to, or
         the destruction of the Investment Property and Pledged Securities,
         whether in the possession of, or maintained as a security entitlement
         or deposit by, or subject to the control of, the Collateral Agent, a
         Securities Intermediary, Commodity Intermediary, any Pledgor or any
         other person; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section
         3.4(c) shall release or relieve any Securities Intermediary or
         Commodity Intermediary of its duties and obligations to the Pledgors or
         any other person under any Control Agreement or under applicable law.
         Each Pledgor shall promptly pay all Claims and fees of whatever kind or
         nature with respect to the Investment Property and Pledged Securities
         pledged by it under this Agreement. In the event any Pledgor shall fail
         to make such payment contemplated in the immediately preceding
         sentence, the Collateral Agent may do so for the account of such
         Pledgor and the Pledgors shall promptly reimburse and indemnify the
         Collateral Agent from all costs and expenses incurred by the

<PAGE>
                                      -18-

         Collateral Agent under this Section 3.4(c) in accordance with Section
         11.03 of the Credit Agreement.

                  (d)      Electronic Chattel Paper and Transferable Records. No
         amount under or in connection with any of the Pledged Collateral is
         evidenced by any Electronic Chattel Paper or any "transferable record"
         (as that term is defined in Section 201 of the Federal Electronic
         Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or in Section 16 of the
         Uniform Electronic Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant
         jurisdiction) other than such Electronic Chattel Paper and transferable
         records listed in Schedule 11 annexed to the Perfection Certificate. If
         any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Pledged
         Collateral shall be evidenced by any Electronic Chattel Paper or any
         transferable record, the Pledgor acquiring such Electronic Chattel
         Paper or transferable record shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent
         thereof and shall take such action as the Collateral Agent may
         reasonably request to vest in the Collateral Agent control under UCC
         Section 9-105 of such Electronic Chattel Paper or control under Section
         201 of the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
         Commerce Act or, as the case may be, Section 16 of the Uniform
         Electronic Transactions Act, as so in effect in such jurisdiction, of
         such transferable record. The requirement in the preceding sentence
         shall apply to the extent that such amount, together with all amounts
         payable evidenced by Electronic Chattel Paper or any transferable
         record in which the Collateral Agent has not been vested control within
         the meaning of the statutes described in this sentence exceeds $500,000
         in the aggregate for all Pledgors. The Collateral Agent agrees with
         such Pledgor that the Collateral Agent will arrange, pursuant to
         procedures satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and so long as such
         procedures will not result in the Collateral Agent's loss of control,
         for the Pledgor to make alterations to the Electronic Chattel Paper or
         transferable record permitted under UCC Section 9-105 or, as the case
         may be, Section 201 of the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
         National Commerce Act or Section 16 of the Uniform Electronic
         Transactions Act for a party in control to allow without loss of
         control, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or
         would occur after taking into account any action by such Pledgor with
         respect to such Electronic Chattel Paper or transferable record.

                  (e)      Letter-of-Credit Rights. If any Pledgor is at any
         time a beneficiary under a Letter of Credit now or hereafter issued in
         favor of such Pledgor, other than a Letter of Credit issued under and
         pursuant to the Credit Agreement, such Pledgor shall promptly notify
         the Collateral Agent thereof and such Pledgor shall, at the request of
         the Collateral Agent, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
         reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either (i) arrange for
         the issuer and any confirmer of such Letter of Credit to consent to an
         assignment to the Collateral Agent of the proceeds of any drawing under
         the Letter of Credit or (ii) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become
         the transferee beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, with the
         Collateral Agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of any
         drawing under the Letter of Credit are to be applied as provided in the
         Credit Agreement. The actions in the preceding sentence shall be taken
         to the extent

<PAGE>
                                      -19-

         that the amount under such Letter of Credit, together with all amounts
         under Letters of Credit for which the actions described above in clause
         (i) and (ii) have not been taken, exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate for
         all Pledgors.

                  (f)      Commercial Tort Claims. As of the date hereof each
         Pledgor hereby represents and warrants that it holds no Commercial Tort
         Claims other than those listed in Schedule 14 annexed to the Perfection
         Certificate. If any Pledgor shall at any time hold or acquire a
         Commercial Tort Claim having a value together with all other Commercial
         Tort Claims of all Pledgors in which the Collateral Agent does not have
         a security interest in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate, such
         Pledgor shall immediately notify the Collateral Agent in writing signed
         by such Pledgor of the brief details thereof and grant to the
         Collateral Agent in such writing a security interest therein and in the
         Proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such
         writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
         Collateral Agent.

                  (g)      Landlord's Access Agreements/Bailee Letters. Each
         Pledgor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon
         as practicable after the date hereof with respect to each location set
         forth in Schedule 4.01(o)(vi) annexed to the Credit Agreement, where
         such Pledgor maintains Pledged Collateral, a Bailee Letter and/or
         Landlord Access Agreement, as applicable, and use commercially
         reasonable efforts to obtain a Bailee Letter, Landlord Access Agreement
         and/or landlord's lien waiver, as applicable, from all bailees and
         landlords, as applicable, who from time to time have possession of
         Pledged Collateral in the ordinary course of such Pledgor's business
         and if reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent; provided that the
         foregoing shall not be required if the value of the Pledged Collateral
         held by such bailee or landlord is less than $50,000, provided further
         that the aggregate value of the Pledged Collateral held by all such
         bailees and landlords who have not delivered a Bailee Letter and/or
         Landlord Access Agreement, as applicable, is less than $500,000.

                  (h)      Motor Vehicles. Upon the request of the Collateral
         Agent, each Pledgor shall deliver to the Collateral Agent originals of
         the certificates of title or ownership for the motor vehicles (and any
         other Equipment covered by certificates of title or ownership) owned by
         it with the Collateral Agent listed as lienholder therein. Such
         requirement shall apply to the Pledgors if any such individual motor
         vehicle (or any such other Equipment) is valued at over $50,000 and if
         the aggregate value of all such motor vehicles (and such Equipment) as
         to which any Pledgor has not delivered a Certificate of Title or
         ownership is over $500,000.

                  (i)      Third Party Agreements. Except as set forth on
         Schedule 3.4(i) annexed hereto, neither the granting of the security
         interests contemplated hereby nor the exercise of remedies in respect
         thereof will constitute or result in the abandonment, invalidation or
         unenforceability of any right, title or interest of any Pledgor under,
         or constitute or result in a default, breach or termination pursuant to
         the terms of, or otherwise permit the ter-

<PAGE>
                                      -20-

         mination of, any lease, contract, property right or agreement as to
         which any Pledgor is party, owner or beneficiary and with respect which
         such Pledgor receives or is entitled to receive aggregate gross
         revenues in excess of $1,000,000 in any 12-month period (other than to
         the extent that any such limitation or restriction would be rendered
         ineffective pursuant to Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the
         UCC (or any successor provision or provisions)) or provides that the
         collateral assignment of or granting of a lien on such lease, contract,
         property right or agreement is prohibited or would be null and void
         without the consent of the applicable counterparty thereto. With
         respect to any lease, contract, property right or agreement set forth
         on Schedule 3.4(i) annexed hereto, Borrower and the applicable Pledgor
         shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain within 90
         days of the Closing Date a letter agreement from the applicable
         counterparty under such lease, contract, property right or agreement,
         in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent,
         acknowledging and agreeing to the granting of the security interest
         contemplated hereby.

                  SECTION 3.5. Joinder of Additional Guarantors. The Pledgors
shall cause each Subsidiary of the Borrower which, from time to time, after the
date hereof shall be required to pledge any assets to the Collateral Agent for
the benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant to the provisions of the Credit
Agreement, (a) to execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent (i) a Joinder
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit 3 annexed hereto and (ii) a
Perfection Certificate, in each case, within thirty (30) Business Days of the
date on which such Subsidiary was acquired or created or (b) in the case of a
Subsidiary organized outside of the United States required to pledge any assets
to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Credit Agreement, to execute and deliver such documentation as the Collateral
Agent shall reasonably request and, in each case, upon such execution and
delivery, such Subsidiary shall constitute a "Guarantor" and a "Pledgor" for all
purposes hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a
Guarantor and Pledgor herein. The execution and delivery of such Joinder
Agreement shall not require the consent of any Pledgor hereunder. The rights and
obligations of each Pledgor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the addition of any new Guarantor or Pledgor as a party to this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.6. Supplements; Further Assurances. Each Pledgor
shall take such further actions, and execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent
such additional assignments, agreements, supplements, powers and instruments, as
the Collateral Agent may in its reasonable judgment deem necessary or
appropriate, wherever required by law, in order to perfect, preserve and protect
the security interest in the Pledged Collateral as provided herein and the
rights and interests granted to the Collateral Agent hereunder, to carry into
effect the purposes hereof or better to assure and confirm unto the Collateral
Agent the Pledged Collateral or permit the Collateral Agent to exercise and
enforce its rights, powers and remedies hereunder with respect to any Pledged
Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Pledgor shall
make, execute, endorse, acknowledge, file or re-file and/or deliver to the
Collateral Agent from time to time upon reasonable request such lists,
descriptions and designations of the Pledged Collateral, copies of warehouse
receipts, receipts in the nature of warehouse receipts, bills of lad-

                                      -21-

ing, documents of title, vouchers, invoices, schedules, confirmatory
assignments, supplements, additional security agreements, conveyances, financing
statements, transfer endorsements, powers of attorney, certificates, reports and
other assurances or instruments as the Collateral Agent shall reasonably
request. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral
Agent may institute and maintain, in its own name or in the name of any Pledgor,
such suits and proceedings as the Collateral Agent may be advised by counsel
shall be necessary or expedient to prevent any impairment of the security
interest in or the perfection thereof in the Pledged Collateral. All of the
foregoing shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Pledgors.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                   REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

           Each Pledgor represents, warrants and covenants as follows:

                  SECTION 4.1. Title. Except for the security interest granted
to the Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant
to this Agreement, such Pledgor owns and, as to Pledged Collateral acquired by
it from time to time after the date hereof, will own the rights in each item of
Pledged Collateral pledged by it hereunder free and clear of any and all Liens
or claims of others other than Permitted Collateral Liens. In addition, no Liens
or claims exist on the Securities Collateral, other than as permitted by Section
6.02 of the Credit Agreement. Such Pledgor has not filed, nor authorized any
third party to file a financing statement or other public notice with respect to
all or any part of the Pledged Collateral on file or of record in any public
office, except such as have been filed in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant
to this Agreement or as are permitted by the Credit Agreement or financing
statements or public notices relating to the termination statements listed on
Schedule 8 to the Perfection Certificate. No person other than the Collateral
Agent has control or possession of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral,
except as permitted by the Credit Agreement.

                  SECTION 4.2. Validity of Security Interest. The security
interest in and Lien on the Pledged Collateral granted to the Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the Secured Parties hereunder constitutes (a) a legal and
valid security interest in all the Pledged Collateral securing the payment and
performance of the Obligations, and (b) subject to the filings and other actions
described in Schedule 6 annexed to the Perfection Certificate, a perfected
security interest in all the Pledged Collateral. The security interest and Lien
granted to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties pursuant
to this Agreement in and on the Pledged Collateral will at all times constitute
a perfected, continuing security interest therein, subject only to Permitted
Collateral Liens.

                  SECTION 4.3. Defense of Claims; Transferability of Pledged
Collateral. Each Pledgor shall, at its own cost and expense, defend title to the
Pledged Collateral pledged by it hereunder and the security interest therein and
Lien thereon granted to the Collateral Agent and

<PAGE>
                                      -22-

the priority thereof against all claims and demands of all persons, at its own
cost and expense, at any time claiming any interest therein adverse to the
Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party other than Permitted Collateral
Liens (other than Contested Liens). There is no agreement, and no Pledgor shall
enter into any agreement or take any other action, that would restrict the
transferability of any of the Pledged Collateral or otherwise not permit, impair
or conflict with such Pledgors' obligations or the rights of the Collateral
Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

                  SECTION 4.4. Other Financing Statements. It has not filed, nor
authorized any third party to file (nor will there be any) valid or effective
financing statement (or similar statement or instrument of registration under
the law of any jurisdiction) covering or purporting to cover any interest of any
kind in the Pledged Collateral other than financing statements and other
statements and instruments relating to Permitted Liens. So long as any of the
Obligations remain unpaid, no Pledgor shall execute, authorize or permit to be
filed in any public office any financing statement (or similar statement or
instrument of registration under the law of any jurisdiction) relating to any
Pledged Collateral, except financing statements and other statements and
instruments filed or to be filed in respect of and covering the security
interests granted by such Pledgor to the holder of the Permitted Collateral
Liens.

                  SECTION 4.5. Chief Executive Office; Change of Name;
Jurisdiction of Organization. (a) It shall comply with the provisions of Section
5.13(a) of the Credit Agreement.

                  (b)      The Collateral Agent may rely on opinions of counsel
as to whether any or all UCC financing statements of the Pledgors need to be
amended as a result of any of the changes described in Section 5.13(a) of the
Credit Agreement. If any Pledgor fails to provide information to the Collateral
Agent about such changes on a timely basis, the Collateral Agent shall not be
liable or responsible to any party for any failure to maintain a perfected
security interest in such Pledgor's property constituting Pledged Collateral,
for which the Collateral Agent needed to have information relating to such
changes. The Collateral Agent shall have no duty to inquire about such changes
if any Pledgor does not inform the Collateral Agent of such changes, the parties
acknowledging and agreeing that it would not be feasible or practical for the
Collateral Agent to search for information on such changes if such information
is not provided by any Pledgor.

                  SECTION 4.6. Location of Inventory and Equipment. It shall not
move any Equipment or Inventory to any location other than one that is listed in
the relevant Schedules to the Perfection Certificate until (i) it shall have
given the Collateral Agent not less than 30 days' prior written notice (in the
form of an Officers' Certificate) of its intention so to do, clearly describing
such new location within the continental United States and providing such other
information in connection therewith as the Collateral Agent may request and (ii)
with respect to such new location, such Pledgor shall have taken all action
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent to maintain the perfection and
priority of the security interest of the Collateral Agent for

<PAGE>
                                      -23-

the benefit of the Secured Parties in the Pledged Collateral intended to be
granted hereby, including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
waivers of landlord's or warehousemen's and/or bailee's liens with respect to
such new location, if applicable, and if requested by the Collateral Agent. Such
Pledgor agrees to provide the Collateral Agent with prompt notice following the
movement of any Equipment or Inventory to any location other than one that is
listed in the relevant Schedules to the Perfection Certificate.

                  SECTION 4.7. Due Authorization and Issuance. All of the
Initial Pledged Shares have been, and to the extent any Pledged Shares are
hereafter issued, such Pledged Shares will be, upon such issuance, duly
authorized, validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable. All of the Initial
Pledged Interests have been fully paid for, and there is no amount or other
obligation owing by any Pledgor to any issuer of the Initial Pledged Interests
in exchange for or in connection with the issuance of the Initial Pledged
Interests or any Pledgor's status as a partner or a member of any issuer of the
Initial Pledged Interests.

                  SECTION 4.8. Consents, etc. In the event that the Collateral
Agent desires to exercise any remedies, voting or consensual rights or
attorney-in-fact powers set forth in this Agreement and determines it necessary
to obtain any approvals or consents of any Governmental Authority or any other
person therefor, then, upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, such
Pledgor agrees to use its best efforts to assist and aid the Collateral Agent to
obtain as soon as practicable any necessary approvals or consents for the
exercise of any such remedies, rights and powers.

                  SECTION 4.9. Pledged Collateral. All information set forth
herein, including the schedules annexed hereto, and all information contained in
any documents, schedules and lists heretofore delivered to any Secured Party,
including the Perfection Certificate and the schedules thereto, in connection
with this Agreement, in each case, relating to the Pledged Collateral, is
accurate and complete in all material respects. The Pledged Collateral described
on the schedules annexed to the Perfection Certificate constitutes all of the
property of such type of Pledged Collateral owned or held by the Pledgors.

                  SECTION 4.10. Insurance. In the event that the proceeds of any
insurance claim are paid after the Collateral Agent has exercised its right to
foreclose during the continuance of an Event of Default, such Net Cash Proceeds
shall be paid to the Collateral Agent to satisfy any deficiency remaining after
such foreclosure.

                  SECTION 4.11. Payment of Taxes; Compliance with Laws;
Contesting Liens; Claims. Each Pledgor represents and warrants that all Claims
imposed upon or assessed against the Pledged Collateral have been paid and
discharged except to the extent such Claims constitute a Lien not yet due and
payable which is a Contested Lien or a Permitted Collateral Lien. Each Pledgor
shall comply with all Requirements of Law applicable to the Pledged Collateral
the failure to comply with which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Pledgor may at its own expense contest the
validity, amount or applicability of any

<PAGE>
                                      -24-

Claims so long as the contest thereof shall be conducted in accordance with, and
permitted pursuant to the provisions of, the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, (i) no contest of any such
obligation may be pursued by such Pledgor if such contest would expose the
Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to (A) any possible criminal
liability or (B) any additional civil liability for failure to comply with such
obligations unless such Pledgor shall have furnished a bond or other security
therefor satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, or such Secured Party, as the
case may be and (ii) if at any time payment or performance of any obligation
contested by such Pledgor pursuant to this Section 4.11 shall become necessary
to prevent the imposition of remedies because of non-payment, such Pledgor shall
pay or perform the same in sufficient time to prevent the imposition of remedies
in respect of such default or prospective default.

                  SECTION 4.12. Access to Pledged Collateral, Books and Records;
Other Information. Upon reasonable request to each Pledgor, the Collateral
Agent, its agents, accountants and attorneys shall have full and free access to
visit and inspect, as applicable, during normal business hours and such other
reasonable times as may be requested by the Collateral Agent upon reasonable
prior notice all of the Pledged Collateral and Mortgaged Property including all
of the books, correspondence and records of such Pledgor relating thereto. The
Collateral Agent and its representatives may examine the same, take extracts
therefrom and make photocopies thereof, and such Pledgor agrees to render to the
Collateral Agent, at such Pledgor's cost and expense, such clerical and other
assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent with regard
thereto. Such Pledgor shall, at any and all times, within a reasonable time
after written request by the Collateral Agent, furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Collateral Agent, in such manner and in such detail as may be reasonably
requested by the Collateral Agent, additional information with respect to the
Pledged Collateral.

                                   ARTICLE V

              CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONCERNING SECURITIES COLLATERAL

                  SECTION 5.1. Pledge of Additional Securities Collateral. Each
Pledgor shall, upon obtaining any Pledged Securities or Intercompany Notes of
any person, accept the same in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and
forthwith deliver to the Collateral Agent a pledge amendment, duly executed by
such Pledgor, in substantially the form of Exhibit 2 annexed hereto (each, a
"Pledge Amendment"), and the certificates and other documents required under
Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 hereof in respect of the additional Pledged
Securities or Intercompany Notes which are to be pledged pursuant to this
Agreement, and confirming the attachment of the Lien hereby created on and in
respect of such additional Pledged Securities or Intercompany Notes. Each
Pledgor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to attach each Pledge Amendment
to this Agreement and agrees that all Pledged Securities or Intercompany Notes

<PAGE>
                                      -25-

listed on any Pledge Amendment delivered to the Collateral Agent shall for all
purposes hereunder be considered Pledged Collateral.

                  SECTION 5.2. Voting Rights; Distributions; etc.

                  (i) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing:

                  (A)      each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and
         all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Securities
         Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with
         the terms or purposes hereof, the Credit Agreement or any other
         document evidencing the Obligations; provided, however, that no Pledgor
         shall in any event exercise such rights in any manner which could
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (B)      each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain,
         and to utilize free and clear of the Lien hereof, any and all
         Distributions, but only if and to the extent made in accordance with
         the provisions of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that any and
         all such Distributions consisting of rights or interests in the form of
         securities shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent to hold
         as Pledged Collateral and shall, if received by any Pledgor, be
         received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, be
         segregated from the other property or funds of such Pledgor and be
         forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent as Pledged Collateral in
         the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

                  (ii)     The Collateral Agent shall be deemed without further
         action or formality to have granted to each Pledgor all necessary
         consents relating to voting rights and shall, if necessary, upon
         written request of any Pledgor and at the sole cost and expense of the
         Pledgors, from time to time execute and deliver (or cause to be
         executed and delivered) to such Pledgor all such instruments as such
         Pledgor may reasonably request in order to permit such Pledgor to
         exercise the voting and other rights which it is entitled to exercise
         pursuant to Section 5.2(i)(A) hereof and to receive the Distributions
         which it is authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section
         5.2(i)(B) hereof.

                  (iii)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
         Event of Default:

                  (A)      all rights of each Pledgor to exercise the voting and
         other consensual rights it would otherwise be entitled to exercise
         pursuant to Section 5.2(i)(A) hereof shall cease, and all such rights
         shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall
         thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting and other
         consensual rights; and

                  (B)      all rights of each Pledgor to receive Distributions
         which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant
         to Section 5.2(i)(B) hereof shall cease and all such rights shall
         thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall

<PAGE>
                                      -26-

         thereupon have the sole right to receive and hold as Pledged Collateral
         such Distributions.

                  (iv)     Each Pledgor shall, at its sole cost and expense,
         from time to time execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent
         appropriate instruments as the Collateral Agent may request in order to
         permit the Collateral Agent to exercise the voting and other rights
         which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 5.2(iii)(A)
         hereof and to receive all Distributions which it may be entitled to
         receive under Section 5.2(iii)(B) hereof.

                  (v)      All Distributions which are received by any Pledgor
         contrary to the provisions of Section 5.2(i)(B) hereof shall be
         received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be
         segregated from other funds of such Pledgor and shall immediately be
         paid over to the Collateral Agent as Pledged Collateral in the same
         form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

                  SECTION 5.3. Defaults, etc. No Pledgor is in default in the
payment of any portion of any mandatory capital contribution, if any, required
to be made under any agreement to which any Pledgor is a party relating to the
Pledged Securities pledged by any of them, and no Pledgor is in violation of any
other provisions of any such agreement to which any Pledgor is a party, or
otherwise in default or violation thereunder. No Securities Collateral pledged
by any Pledgor is subject to any defense, offset or counterclaim, nor have any
of the foregoing been asserted or alleged against any Pledgor by any person with
respect thereto, and as of the date hereof, there are no certificates,
instruments, documents or other writings (other than the Organizational
Documents and certificates, if any, delivered to the Collateral Agent) which
evidence any Pledged Securities of any Pledgor.

                  SECTION 5.4. Certain Agreements of Pledgors As Issuers and
Holders of Equity Interests.

                  (i)      In the case of each Pledgor which is an issuer of
Securities Collateral, such Pledgor agrees to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement relating to the Securities Collateral issued by it and will comply
with such terms insofar as such terms are applicable to it.

                  (ii)     In the case of each Pledgor which is a partner in a
partnership, limited liability company or other entity, such Pledgor hereby
consents, to the extent required by the applicable Organizational Document, to
the pledge by each other Pledgor, pursuant to the terms hereof, of the Pledged
Interests in such partnership, limited liability company or other entity and,
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to the
transfer of such Pledged Interests to the Collateral Agent or its nominee and to
the substitution of the Collateral Agent or its nominee as a substituted partner
or member in such partnership, limited liability company or other entity with
all the rights, powers and duties of a general partner or a limited partner or
member, as the case may be.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                   CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONCERNING INTELLECTUAL
                              PROPERTY COLLATERAL

                  SECTION 6.1. Grant of License. Each Pledgor hereby grants to
the Collateral Agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, assign,
license or sublicense any and all of the Intellectual Property Collateral now
owned or licensed or hereafter acquired or licensed by such Pledgor, wherever
the same may be located, except, in the case of Intellectual Property Collateral
licensed to such Pledgor, if and to the extent this sublicense would result in
breach of the underlying license or give rise to termination rights by the
licensor with respect thereto, in each case, for the purpose of enabling the
Collateral Agent, during the continuance of an Event of Default, to exercise
rights and remedies under Article IX hereof at such time as the Collateral Agent
shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, and for no
other purpose. Such license shall include access to all media in which any of
the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used
for the compilation or printout hereof.

                  SECTION 6.2. Protection of Collateral Agent's Security. On a
continuing basis, each Pledgor shall, at its sole cost and expense, (i) promptly
following its becoming aware thereof, notify the Collateral Agent of (A) any
materially adverse determination in any proceeding in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office or equivalent foreign
office with respect to any material Intellectual Property Collateral or (B) the
institution of any proceeding or any adverse determination in any federal,
state, local or foreign court or administrative body regarding such Pledgor's
claim of ownership in or right to use any material Intellectual Property
Collateral, its right to register such Intellectual Property Collateral or its
right to keep and maintain such registration in full force and effect, (ii)
maintain and protect material Intellectual Property Collateral, (iii) not permit
to lapse or become abandoned any material Intellectual Property Collateral, and
not settle or compromise any pending or future litigation or administrative
proceeding with respect to such Intellectual Property Collateral, in each case
except as shall be consistent with commercially reasonable business judgment,
(iv) upon such Pledgor obtaining knowledge thereof, promptly notify the
Collateral Agent in writing of any event which may be reasonably expected to
materially and adversely affect the value or utility of any material
Intellectual Property Collateral, the ability of such Pledgor or the Collateral
Agent to use, exploit, license or dispose of such Intellectual Property
Collateral or any portion thereof or the rights and remedies of the Collateral
Agent in relation thereto including a levy or threat of levy or any legal
process against such Intellectual Property Collateral or any portion thereof,
(v) not license any material Intellectual Property Collateral other than
licenses entered into by such Pledgor in, or incidental to, the ordinary course
of business, or amend or permit the amendment of any of the licenses in a manner
that materially and adversely affects the right to receive payments thereunder,
or in any manner that would materially impair the value of the Intellectual
Property Collateral or the Lien on and security interest in such Intellectual
Property Collateral intended to be granted to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties,

<PAGE>
                                      -28-

without the consent of the Collateral Agent, (vi) diligently keep adequate
records respecting the Intellectual Property Collateral and (vii) furnish to the
Collateral Agent from time to time upon the Collateral Agent's request therefor
reasonably detailed statements and amended schedules further identifying and
describing the Intellectual Property Collateral and such other materials
evidencing or reports pertaining to the Intellectual Property Collateral as the
Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request.

                  SECTION 6.3. After-Acquired Property. If any Pledgor shall, at
any time before the Obligations have been paid in full (other than contingent
indemnification obligations which, pursuant to the provisions of the Credit
Agreement or the Security Documents, survive the termination thereof), the
Commitments have been terminated and all Letters of Credit have been canceled or
have expired, (i) obtain any rights to any additional Intellectual Property or
(ii) become entitled to the benefit of any additional Intellectual Property or
any renewal or extension thereof, including any reissue, division, continuation,
or continuation-in-part of any Intellectual Property, or any improvement on any
Intellectual Property, the provisions hereof shall automatically apply thereto
and any such item enumerated in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 6.3 with
respect to such Pledgor shall automatically constitute Intellectual Property
Collateral if such would have constituted Intellectual Property Collateral at
the time of execution hereof and be subject to the Lien and security interest
created by this Agreement without further action by any party. Each Pledgor
shall promptly (i) provide to the Collateral Agent written notice of any of the
foregoing and (ii) confirm the attachment of the Lien and security interest
created by this Agreement to any rights described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence of this Section 6.3 by execution of an instrument
in form reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent and the filing of any
instruments or statements as shall be reasonably necessary to preserve, protect
or perfect the Collateral Agent's security interest in such Intellectual
Property. Further, each Pledgor authorizes the Collateral Agent to modify this
Agreement by amending Schedules 13(c) and 13(d) annexed to the Perfection
Certificate to include any Intellectual Property acquired or arising after the
date hereof of such Pledgor.

                  SECTION 6.4. Litigation. Unless there shall occur and be
continuing any Event of Default, each Pledgor shall have the right to commence
and prosecute in its own name, as the party in interest, for its own benefit and
at the sole cost and expense of the Pledgors, such applications for protection
of the Intellectual Property Collateral and suits, proceedings or other actions
to prevent the infringement, misappropriation, invalidation, abandonment,
counterfeiting, unfair competition, dilution, diminution in value or other
damage as are necessary to preserve and protect the Intellectual Property
Collateral. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, the Collateral Agent shall have the right but shall in no way be
obligated to file applications for preservation and protection of the
Intellectual Property Collateral and/or bring suit in the name of any Pledgor,
the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties to enforce the Intellectual Property
Collateral. In the event of such suit, each Pledgor shall, at the reasonable
request of the Collateral Agent, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and
all documents requested by the Collateral Agent in aid of such enforcement and
the Pledgors shall promptly reimburse and indemnify the Collateral Agent for all
costs and expenses incurred by the Collat-

<PAGE>
                                      -29-

eral Agent in the exercise of its rights under this Section 6.4 in accordance
with Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement. In the event that the Collateral
Agent shall elect not to bring suit to enforce the Intellectual Property
Collateral, each Pledgor agrees, at the reasonable request of the Collateral
Agent, to take all commercially reasonable actions necessary, whether by suit,
proceeding or other action, to prevent the infringement, misappropriation,
invalidation, abandonment, counterfeiting, unfair competition, dilution,
diminution in value of or other damage to any of the Intellectual Property
Collateral by others and for that purpose agrees to diligently maintain any
suit, proceeding or other action necessary to prevent such infringement.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                     CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONCERNING ACCOUNTS

                  SECTION 7.1. Maintenance of Records. Each Pledgor shall keep
and maintain at its own cost and expense complete records of each Account, in a
manner consistent with prudent business practice, including records of all
payments received, all credits granted thereon, all merchandise returned and all
other documentation relating thereto. Each Pledgor shall, at such Pledgor's sole
cost and expense, upon the Collateral Agent's demand made at any time after the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, deliver all
tangible evidence of Accounts, including all documents evidencing Accounts and
any books and records relating thereto to the Collateral Agent or to its
representatives (copies of which evidence and books and records may be retained
by such Pledgor). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, the Collateral Agent may transfer a full and complete copy of any
Pledgor's books, records, credit information, reports, memoranda and all other
writings relating to the Accounts to and for the use by any person that has
acquired or is contemplating acquisition of an interest in the Accounts or the
Collateral Agent's security interest therein without the consent of any Pledgor.

                  SECTION 7.2. Legend. Each Pledgor shall legend, at the request
of the Collateral Agent and in form and manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent, the Accounts and the other books, records and documents of
such Pledgor evidencing or pertaining to the Accounts with an appropriate
reference to the fact that the Accounts have been collaterally assigned to the
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and that the Collateral
Agent has a security interest therein.

                  SECTION 7.3. Modification of Terms, etc. No Pledgor shall
rescind or cancel any obligations evidenced by any Account or modify any term
thereof or make any adjustment with respect thereto except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with prudent business practice, or extend or renew
any such obligations except in the ordinary course of business consistent with
prudent business practice or compromise or settle any dispute, claim, suit or
legal proceeding relating thereto or sell any Account or interest therein except
in the ordinary course of business consistent with prudent business practice
without the prior written consent of the

<PAGE>
                                      -30-

Collateral Agent. Each Pledgor shall timely fulfill all obligations on its part
to be fulfilled under or in connection with the Accounts.

                  SECTION 7.4. Collection. Each Pledgor shall cause to be
collected from the Account Debtor of each of the Accounts, as and when due in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with prudent business practice
(including Accounts that are delinquent, such Accounts to be collected in
accordance with generally accepted commercial collection procedures), any and
all amounts owing under or on account of such Account, and apply forthwith upon
receipt thereof all such amounts as are so collected to the outstanding balance
of such Account, except that any Pledgor may, with respect to an Account, allow
in the ordinary course of business (i) a refund or credit due as a result of
returned or damaged or defective merchandise and (ii) such extensions of time to
pay amounts due in respect of Accounts and such other modifications of payment
terms or settlements in respect of Accounts as shall be commercially reasonable
in the circumstances, all in accordance with such Pledgor's ordinary course of
business consistent with its collection practices as in effect from time to
time. The costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of collection, in any
case, whether incurred by any Pledgor, the Collateral Agent or any Secured
Party, shall be paid by the Pledgors.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   TRANSFERS

                  SECTION 8.1. Transfers of Pledged Collateral. No Pledgor shall
sell, convey, assign or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect
to, any of the Pledged Collateral pledged by it hereunder except as permitted by
the Credit Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                    REMEDIES

                  SECTION 9.1. Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default the Collateral Agent may from time to time
exercise in respect of the Pledged Collateral, in addition to the other rights
and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, the following
remedies, in accordance with applicable law:

                  (i)      personally, or by agents or attorneys, immediately
take possession of the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof, from any Pledgor
or any other person who then has possession of any part thereof with or without
notice or process of law, and for that purpose may enter upon any Pledgor's
premises where any of the Pledged Collateral is located, remove such Pledged
Collateral, remain present at such premises to receive copies of all
communications and

<PAGE>
                                      -31-

remittances relating to the Pledged Collateral and use in connection with such
removal and possession any and all services, supplies, aids and other facilities
of any Pledgor;

                  (ii)     demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or
property at any time payable or receivable in respect of the Pledged Collateral
including instructing the obligor or obligors on any agreement, instrument or
other obligation constituting part of the Pledged Collateral to make any payment
required by the terms of such agreement, instrument or other obligation directly
to the Collateral Agent, and in connection with any of the foregoing,
compromise, settle, extend the time for payment and make other modifications
with respect thereto; provided, however, that in the event that any such
payments are made directly to any Pledgor, prior to receipt by any such obligor
of such instruction, such Pledgor shall segregate all amounts received pursuant
thereto in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall promptly (but
in no event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt thereof) pay such
amounts to the Collateral Agent;

                  (iii)    sell, assign, grant a license to use or otherwise
liquidate, or direct any Pledgor to sell, assign, grant a license to use or
otherwise liquidate, any and all investments made in whole or in part with the
Pledged Collateral or any part thereof, and take possession of the proceeds of
any such sale, assignment, license or liquidation;

                  (iv)     take possession of the Pledged Collateral or any part
thereof, by directing any Pledgor in writing to deliver the same to the
Collateral Agent at any place or places so designated by the Collateral Agent,
in which event such Pledgor shall at its own expense: (A) forthwith cause the
same to be moved to the place or places designated by the Collateral Agent and
therewith delivered to the Collateral Agent, (B) store and keep any Pledged
Collateral so delivered to the Collateral Agent at such place or places pending
further action by the Collateral Agent and (C) while the Pledged Collateral
shall be so stored and kept, provide such security and maintenance services as
shall be necessary to protect the same and to preserve and maintain them in good
condition. Each Pledgor's obligation to deliver the Pledged Collateral as
contemplated in this Section 9.1(iv) is of the essence hereof. Upon application
to a court of equity having jurisdiction, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled
to a decree requiring specific performance by any Pledgor of such obligation;

                  (v)      withdraw all moneys, instruments, securities and
other property in any bank, financial securities, deposit or other account of
any Pledgor constituting Pledged Collateral for application to the Obligations
as provided in Article X hereof;

                  (vi)     retain and apply the Distributions to the Obligations
as provided in Article X hereof;

                  (vii)    exercise any and all rights as beneficial and legal
owner of the Pledged Collateral, including perfecting assignment of and
exercising any and all voting, consensual and other rights and powers with
respect to any Pledged Collateral; and

<PAGE>
                                      -32-


                  (viii)   exercise any and all the rights and remedies of a
secured party on default under the UCC, and the Collateral Agent may also in its
sole discretion, without notice except as specified in Section 9.2 hereof, sell,
assign or grant a license to use the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof in
one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker's board
or at any of the Collateral Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or
for future delivery, and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as
the Collateral Agent may deem commercially reasonable. The Collateral Agent or
any other Secured Party or any of their respective Affiliates may be the
purchaser, licensee, assignee or recipient of any or all of the Pledged
Collateral at any such sale and shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding
and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of
the Pledged Collateral sold, assigned or licensed at such sale, to use and apply
any of the Obligations owed to such person as a credit on account of the
purchase price of any Pledged Collateral payable by such person at such sale.
Each purchaser, assignee, licensee or recipient at any such sale shall acquire
the property sold, assigned or licensed absolutely free from any claim or right
on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which
it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or
statute now existing or hereafter enacted. The Collateral Agent shall not be
obligated to make any sale of Pledged Collateral regardless of notice of sale
having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale
from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such
sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was
so adjourned. Each Pledgor hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any claims against the Collateral Agent arising by reason of the fact that
the price at which any Pledged Collateral may have been sold, assigned or
licensed at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been
obtained at a public sale, even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer
received and does not offer such Pledged Collateral to more than one offeree.

                  SECTION 9.2. Notice of Sale. Each Pledgor acknowledges and
agrees that, to the extent notice of sale or other disposition of Pledged
Collateral shall be required by law, ten (10) days' prior notice to such Pledgor
of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which any private
sale or other intended disposition is to take place shall be commercially
reasonable notification of such matters. No notification need be given to any
Pledgor if it has signed, in accordance with applicable law, after the
occurrence of an Event of Default, a statement renouncing or modifying any right
to notification of sale or other intended disposition.

                  SECTION 9.3. Waiver of Notice and Claims. Each Pledgor hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, notice or judicial
hearing in connection with the Collateral Agent's taking possession or the
Collateral Agent's disposition of any of the Pledged Collateral, including any
and all prior notice and hearing for any prejudgment remedy or remedies and any
such right which such Pledgor would otherwise have under law, and each Pledgor
hereby further waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i)
all damages occasioned by such taking of possession, (ii) all other requirements
as to the time, place and terms of sale or other requirements with respect to
the enforcement of the Collateral Agent's rights hereunder and (iii) all rights
of redemption, appraisal, valuation, stay, extension or moratorium now

<PAGE>
                                      -33-

or hereafter in force under any applicable law. The Collateral Agent shall not
be liable for any incorrect or improper payment made pursuant to this Article IX
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any sale of, or the
grant of options to purchase, or any other realization upon, any Pledged
Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand,
either at law or in equity, of the applicable Pledgor therein and thereto, and
shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against such Pledgor and
against any and all persons claiming or attempting to claim the Pledged
Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof, from,
through or under such Pledgor.

                  SECTION 9.4. Certain Sales of Pledged Collateral.

                  (i)      Each Pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in law, rules, regulations or orders of any Governmental
Authority, the Collateral Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of
all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who meet
the requirements of such Governmental Authority. Each Pledgor acknowledges that
any such sales may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Collateral
Agent than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions,
and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such restricted sale
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that,
except as may be required by applicable law, the Collateral Agent shall have no
obligation to engage in public sales in respect of such Pledged Collateral.

                  (ii)     Each Pledgor recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act, and applicable state securities
laws, the Collateral Agent may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or
any part of the Securities Collateral and Investment Property, to limit
purchasers to persons who will agree, among other things, to acquire such
Securities Collateral or Investment Property for their own account, for
investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each
Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be at prices and on terms
less favorable to the Collateral Agent than those obtainable through a public
sale without such restrictions (including a public offering made pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act) and, notwithstanding such
circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been
made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Collateral Agent shall
have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale
of any Securities Collateral or Investment Property for the period of time
necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form of public sale
requiring registration under the Securities Act or under applicable state
securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so.

                  (iii)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Pledgor shall,
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at the
reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Collateral
Agent, cause any registration, qualification under or compliance with any
Federal or state securities law or laws to be effected with respect to all or
any part of the Securities Collateral as soon as practicable and at the sole
cost and expense of the

<PAGE>
                                      -34-

Pledgors. Each Pledgor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such qualification and compliance to be
effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested and as would permit or
facilitate the sale and distribution of such Securities Collateral including
registration under the Securities Act (or any similar statute then in effect),
appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities
laws and appropriate compliance with all other requirements of any Governmental
Authority. Each Pledgor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Collateral Agent to be kept advised in writing as to the progress of each
such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof,
shall furnish to the Collateral Agent such number of prospectuses, offering
circulars or other documents incident thereto as the Collateral Agent from time
to time may request, and shall indemnify and shall cause the issuer of the
Securities Collateral to indemnify the Collateral Agent and all others
participating in the distribution of such Securities Collateral against all
claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any
related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or
alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement,
notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

                  (iv)     If the Collateral Agent determines to exercise its
right to sell any or all of the Securities Collateral or Investment Property,
upon written request, the applicable Pledgor shall from time to time furnish to
the Collateral Agent all such information as the Collateral Agent may reasonably
request in order to determine the number of securities included in the
Securities Collateral or Investment Property which may be sold by the Collateral
Agent as exempt transactions under the Securities Act and the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from time to time
in effect.

                  (v)      Each Pledgor further agrees that a breach of any of
the covenants contained in this Section 9.4 will cause irreparable injury to the
Collateral Agent and other Secured Parties, that the Collateral Agent and the
other Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach
and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section
9.4 shall be specifically enforceable against such Pledgor, and such Pledgor
hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for
specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  SECTION 9.5. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

                  (i)      No failure on the part of the Collateral Agent to
exercise, no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay on the part of the
Collateral Agent in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy; nor shall the
Collateral Agent be required to

<PAGE>
                                      -35-

look first to, enforce or exhaust any other security, collateral or guaranties.
The remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

                  (ii)     In the event that the Collateral Agent shall have
instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under this
Agreement by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such proceeding shall
have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined
adversely to the Collateral Agent, then and in every such case, the Pledgors,
the Collateral Agent and each other Secured Party shall be restored to their
respective former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Pledged
Collateral, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Collateral Agent and the
other Secured Parties shall continue as if no such proceeding had been
instituted.

                  SECTION 9.6. Certain Additional Actions Regarding Intellectual
Property. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, upon
the written demand of the Collateral Agent, each Pledgor shall execute and
deliver to the Collateral Agent an assignment or further license of the
Intellectual Property Collateral, in whole or in part as the Collateral Agent
determines, and such other documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry
out the intent and purposes hereof. Within five (5) Business Days of written
notice thereafter from the Collateral Agent, each Pledgor shall make available
to the Collateral Agent, to the extent within such Pledgor's power and
authority, such personnel in such Pledgor's employ on the date of the Event of
Default as the Collateral Agent may reasonably designate to permit such Pledgor
to continue, directly or indirectly, to produce, advertise and sell the products
and services sold by such Pledgor under the Intellectual Property Collateral,
and such persons shall be available to perform their prior functions on the
Collateral Agent's behalf.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION  11.1. Concerning Collateral Agent.

                  (i)      The Collateral Agent has been appointed as collateral
agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The actions of the Collateral Agent
hereunder are subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. The Collateral
Agent shall have the right hereunder to make demands, to give notices, to
exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from
taking action (including the release or substitution of the Pledged Collateral),
in accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent
may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact in connection herewith and shall not be
liable for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it in good faith. The Collateral Agent may resign and a successor
Collateral Agent may be appointed in the manner provided in the Credit
Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Collateral Agent by a
successor Collateral Agent, that successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Collateral Agent under this Agreement, and the retiring
Collateral Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement. After any retiring Collateral Agent's resignation, the
provisions hereof shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it under this Agreement while it was the Collateral Agent.

                  (ii)     The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Pledged
Collateral in its possession if such Pledged Collateral is accorded treatment
substantially equivalent to that which the Collateral Agent, in its individual
capacity, accords its own property consisting of similar instruments or
interests, it being understood that neither the Collateral Agent nor any of the
Secured Parties shall have responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action
with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other
matters relating to any Securities Collateral, whether or not the Collateral
Agent or any other Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge of such
matters or (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any person
with respect to any Pledged Collateral.

                  (iii)    The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
any written notice, statement, certificate, order or other document or any
telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper person, and, with respect to all matters
pertaining to this Agreement and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel
selected by it.

                  (iv)     If any item of Pledged Collateral also constitutes
collateral granted to the Collateral Agent under any other deed of trust,
mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of any type, in the event of
any conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of

<PAGE>

                                      -37-

such other deed of trust, mortgage, security agreement, pledge or instrument of
any type in respect of such collateral, the Collateral Agent, in its sole
discretion, shall select which provision or provisions shall control.

                  SECTION 11.2. Collateral Agent May Perform; Collateral Agent
Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. If any Pledgor shall fail to perform any covenants
contained in this Agreement (including such Pledgor's covenants to (i) pay the
premiums in respect of all required insurance policies hereunder, (ii) pay
Claims, (iii) make repairs, (iv) discharge Liens or (v) pay or perform any
obligations of such Pledgor under any Pledged Collateral) or if any
representation or warranty on the part of any Pledgor contained herein shall be
breached, the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) do the same
or cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and may expend funds for such
purpose; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall in no event be bound
to inquire into the validity of any tax, lien, imposition or other obligation
which such Pledgor fails to pay or perform as and when required hereby and which
such Pledgor does not contest in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.11
hereof. Any and all amounts so expended by the Collateral Agent shall be paid by
the Pledgors in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.03 of the Credit
Agreement. Neither the provisions of this Section 11.2 nor any action taken by
the Collateral Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11.2 shall
prevent any such failure to observe any covenant contained in this Agreement nor
any breach of representation or warranty from constituting an Event of Default.
Each Pledgor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent its attorney-in-fact, with
full authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such
Pledgor, or otherwise, from time to time in the Collateral Agent's discretion to
take any action and to execute any instrument consistent with the terms of the
Credit Agreement, this Agreement and the other Security Documents which the
Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes
hereof. The foregoing grant of authority is a power of attorney coupled with an
interest and such appointment shall be irrevocable for the term hereof. Each
Pledgor hereby ratifies all that such attorney shall lawfully do or cause to be
done by virtue hereof.

                  SECTION 11.3. Continuing Security Interest; Assignment. This
Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Pledged Collateral
and shall (i) be binding upon the Pledgors, their respective successors and
assigns and (ii) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral
Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured
Parties and each of their respective successors, transferees and assigns. No
other persons (including any other creditor of any Pledgor) shall have any
interest herein or any right or benefit with respect hereto. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing clause (ii), any Secured Party may assign or
otherwise transfer any indebtedness held by it secured by this Agreement to any
other person, and such other person shall thereupon become vested with all the
benefits in respect thereof granted to such Secured Party, herein or otherwise,
subject however, to the provisions of the Credit Agreement and any Hedging
Agreement.

                  SECTION 11.4. Termination; Release. The Pledged Collateral
shall be released from the Lien of this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of the Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>

                                      -38-

Upon termination hereof or any release of Pledged Collateral in accordance with
the provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall, upon the
request and at the sole cost and expense of the Pledgors, assign, transfer and
deliver to Pledgor, against receipt and without recourse to or warranty by the
Collateral Agent except as to the fact that the Collateral Agent has not
encumbered the released assets, such of the Pledged Collateral to be released
(in the case of a release) as may be in possession of the Collateral Agent and
as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the terms hereof,
and, with respect to any other Pledged Collateral, proper documents and
instruments (including UCC-3 termination statements or releases) acknowledging
the termination hereof or the release of such Pledged Collateral, as the case
may be.

                  SECTION 11.5. Modification in Writing. No amendment,
modification, supplement, termination or waiver of or to any provision hereof,
nor consent to any departure by any Pledgor therefrom, shall be effective unless
the same shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and
unless in writing and signed by the Collateral Agent. Any amendment,
modification or supplement of or to any provision hereof, any waiver of any
provision hereof and any consent to any departure by any Pledgor from the terms
of any provision hereof shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is
specifically required by this Agreement or any other document evidencing the
Obligations, no notice to or demand on any Pledgor in any case shall entitle any
Pledgor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

                  SECTION 11.6. Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein or in
the Credit Agreement, any notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be given in the manner and become effective as set
forth in the Credit Agreement, as to any Pledgor, addressed to it at the address
of the Borrower set forth in the Credit Agreement and as to the Collateral
Agent, addressed to it at the address set forth in the Credit Agreement, or in
each case at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a
written notice to the other party complying as to delivery with the terms of
this Section 11.6.

                  SECTION 11.7. Governing Law, Consent to Jurisdiction and
Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial. Sections 11.09 and 11.10 of the Credit
Agreement are incorporated herein, mutatis mutandis, as if a part hereof.

                  SECTION 11.8. Severability of Provisions. Any provision hereof
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 11.9. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and
any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements hereto may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original,
but all such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -39-

by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

                  SECTION 11.10. Business Days. In the event any time period or
any date provided in this Agreement ends or falls on a day other than a Business
Day, then such time period shall be deemed to end and such date shall be deemed
to fall on the next succeeding Business Day, and performance herein may be made
on such Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on such other
day.

                  SECTION 11.11. Waiver of Stay. Each Pledgor covenants (to the
extent it may lawfully do so) that in the event that such Pledgor or any
property or assets of such Pledgor shall hereafter become the subject of a
voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or
such Pledgor shall otherwise be a party to any federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or similar proceeding to which the provisions relating to
the automatic stay under Section 362 of Title 11 of the United States Code or
any similar provision in any such law is applicable, then, in any such case,
whether or not the Collateral Agent has commenced foreclosure proceedings under
this Agreement, such Pledgor shall not, and each Pledgor hereby expressly waives
their right to (to the extent it may lawfully do so) at any time insist upon,
plead or in any manner whatsoever, claim or take the benefit or advantage of any
such automatic stay or such similar provision as it relates to the exercise of
any of the rights and remedies (including any foreclosure proceedings) available
to the Collateral Agent as provided in this Agreement, in any other Security
Document or any other document evidencing the Obligations. Each Pledgor further
covenants (to the extent it may lawfully do so) that it will not hinder, delay
or impede the execution of any power granted herein to the Collateral Agent, but
will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no law
relating to any stay or similar provision had been enacted.

                  SECTION 11.12. No Credit for Payment of Taxes or Imposition.
No Pledgor shall be entitled to any credit against the principal, premium, if
any, or interest payable under the Credit Agreement, and no Pledgor shall be
entitled to any credit against any other sums which may become payable under the
terms thereof or hereof, by reason of the payment of any Tax on the Pledged
Collateral or any part thereof.

                  SECTION 11.13. No Claims Against Collateral Agent. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall constitute any consent or request by the
Collateral Agent, express or implied, for the performance of any labor or
services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the
Pledged Collateral or any part thereof, nor as giving any Pledgor any right,
power or authority to contract for or permit the performance of any labor or
services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in such fashion as
would permit the making of any claim against the Collateral Agent in respect
thereof or any claim that any Lien based on the performance of such labor or
services or the furnishing of any such materials or other property is prior to
the Lien hereof.

                                      -40-

                  SECTION 11.14. No Release. Nothing set forth in this Agreement
shall relieve any Pledgor from the performance of any term, covenant, condition
or agreement on such Pledgor's part to be performed or observed under or in
respect of any of the Pledged Collateral at any time prior to the sale,
assignment or transfer of such Pledged Collateral in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement or from any liability to any person under or in respect of any
of the Pledged Collateral or shall impose any obligation on the Collateral Agent
or any other Secured Party to perform or observe any such term, covenant,
condition or agreement on such Pledgor's part to be so performed or observed or
shall impose any liability on the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party
for any act or omission on the part of such Pledgor relating thereto or for any
breach of any representation or warranty on the part of such Pledgor contained
in this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or under or
in respect of the Pledged Collateral or made in connection herewith or
therewith. The obligations of each Pledgor contained in this Section 11.14 shall
survive the termination hereof and the discharge of such Pledgor's other
obligations under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

                  SECTION 11.15. Obligations Absolute. All obligations of each
Pledgor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

                  (i)      any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or the like of any
         Pledgor;

                  (ii)     any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit
         Agreement, any Hedging Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any
         other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iii)    any change in the time, manner or place of payment
         of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any
         other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the
         Credit Agreement, any Hedging Agreement or any other Loan Document or
         any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (iv)     any pledge, exchange, release or non-perfection of
         any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or
         consent to any departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the
         Obligations;

                  (v)      any exercise, non-exercise or waiver of any right,
         remedy, power or privilege under or in respect hereof, the Credit
         Agreement, any Hedging Agreement or any other Loan Document except as
         specifically set forth in a waiver granted pursuant to the provisions
         of Section 11.5 hereof; or

                  (vi)     any other circumstances which might otherwise
         constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Pledgor.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  Reference is made to that certain security agreement (as
amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, the "Security Agreement;" capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Security
Agreement), dated as of February 13, 2004, made by IONICS, INCORPORATED, a
Massachusetts corporation (the "Borrower"), the Guarantors party thereto and UBS
AG, STAMFORD BRANCH, as collateral agent (in such capacity and together with any
successors in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent").

                  This letter supplements the Security Agreement and is
delivered by the undersigned, [     ] (the "New Pledgor"), pursuant to Section
3.5 of the Security Agreement. The New Pledgor hereby agrees to be bound as a
Guarantor and as a Pledgor by all of the terms, covenants and conditions set
forth in the Security Agreement to the same extent that it would have been bound
if it had been a signatory to the Security Agreement on the execution date of
the Security Agreement. The New Pledgor also hereby agrees to be bound as a
party by all of the terms, covenants and conditions applicable to it set forth
in Articles V, VI and VII of the Credit Agreement to the same extent that it
would have been bound if it had been a signatory to the Credit Agreement on the
execution date of the Credit Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the New Pledgor hereby grants and pledges to the Collateral Agent, as
collateral security for the full, prompt and complete payment and performance
when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the
Obligations, a Lien on and security

interest in, all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Pledged
Collateral and expressly assumes all obligations and liabilities of a Guarantor
and Pledgor thereunder. The New Pledgor hereby makes each of the representations
and warranties and agrees to each of the covenants applicable to the Pledgors
contained in the Security Agreement and Article III of the Credit Agreement.

                  Annexed hereto are supplements to each of the schedules to the
Security Agreement and the Credit Agreement, as applicable, with respect to the
New Pledgor. Such supplements shall be deemed to be part of the Security
Agreement or the Credit Agreement, as applicable.

                  This agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or
supplements hereto may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page of this agreement by telecopy shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this agreement.

                  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the New Pledgor has caused this letter
agreement to be executed and delivered by its duly authorized officer as of the
date first above written.

                                    [Form of]

                CONTROL AGREEMENT CONCERNING SECURITIES ACCOUNTS

                  This Control Agreement Concerning Securities Accounts (this
"Control Agreement"), dated as of [     ], by and among [     ] (the "Pledgor"),
UBS AG, Stamford Branch (the "Collateral Agent") and [     ] (the "Securities
Intermediary"), is delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(c) of that certain security
agreement (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time, the "Security Agreement"), dated as of February 13, 2004,
made by the Pledgor and each of the Guarantors listed on the signature pages
thereto in favor of UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as collateral agent, as pledgee,
assignee and secured party (the "Collateral Agent"). This Control Agreement is
for the purpose of perfecting the security interests of the Secured Parties
granted by the Pledgor in the Designated Accounts described below. All
references herein to the "UCC" shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect from time to time in the State of New York. Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the
Security Agreement.

                  Section 1. Confirmation of Establishment and Maintenance of
Designated Accounts. The Securities Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that
(i) the Securities Intermediary has established for the Pledgor and maintains
the account(s) listed in Schedule I annexed hereto (such account(s), together
with each such other securities account maintained by the Pledgor with the
Securities Intermediary collectively, the "Designated Accounts" and each a
"Designated Account"), (ii) each Designated Account will be maintained in the
manner set forth herein until termination of this Control Agreement, (iii) this
Control Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Securities
Intermediary, (iv) the Securities Intermediary is a "securities intermediary" as
defined in Article 8-102(a)(14) of the UCC, (v) each of the Designated Accounts
is a "securities account" as such term is defined in Section 8-501(a) of the UCC
and (vi) all securities or other property underlying any financial assets which
are credited to any Designated Account shall be registered in the name of the
Securities Intermediary, endorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank or
credited to another securities account maintained in the name of the Securities
Intermediary and in no case will any financial asset credited to any Designated
Account be registered in the name of the Pledgor, payable to the order of the
Pledgor or specially endorsed to the Pledgor, except to the extent the foregoing
have been specially endorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank.

                  Section 2. "Financial Assets" Election. The Securities
Intermediary hereby agrees that each item of Investment Property credited to any
Designated Account shall be treated as a "financial asset" within the meaning of
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.

<PAGE>

                                      -2-

                  Section 3. Entitlement Order. If at any time the Securities
Intermediary shall receive an "entitlement order" (within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(8) of the UCC) issued by the Collateral Agent and relating to any
financial asset maintained in one or more of the Designated Accounts, the
Securities Intermediary shall comply with such entitlement order without further
consent by the Pledgor or any other person. The Securities Intermediary shall
also comply with instructions directing the Securities Intermediary with respect
to the sale, exchange or transfer of financial assets held in each Designated
Account originated by a Pledgor, or any representative of, or investment manager
appointed by, a Pledgor until such time as the Collateral Agent delivers a
Notice of Sole Control pursuant to Section 9(i) to the Securities Intermediary.

                  Section 4. Subordination of Lien; Waiver of Set-Off. The
Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that any security interest in any
Designated Account it now has or subsequently obtains shall be subordinate to
the security interest of the Collateral Agent. The financial assets and other
items deposited to any Designated Account will not be subject to deduction,
set-off, banker's lien, or any other right in favor of any person other than the
Secured Parties (except that the Securities Intermediary may set off all amounts
due to the Securities Intermediary in respect of its customary fees and expenses
for the routine maintenance and operation of the Designated Accounts, including
overdraft fees and amounts advanced to settle authorized transactions.

                  Section 5. Choice of Law. Both this Control Agreement and the
Designated Accounts shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for purposes of the UCC, New
York shall be deemed to be the Securities Intermediary's location and the
Designated Accounts (as well as the security entitlements related thereto) shall
be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

                  Section 6. Conflict with Other Agreements; Amendments. As of
the date hereof, there are no other agreements entered into between the
Securities Intermediary and the Pledgor with respect to any Designated Account
or any security entitlements or other financial assets credited thereto (other
than standard and customary documentation with respect to the establishment and
maintenance of such Designated Accounts). The Securities Intermediary and the
Pledgor will not enter into any other agreement with respect to any Designated
Account unless the Collateral Agent shall have received prior written notice
thereof. The Securities Intermediary and the Pledgor have not and will not enter
into any other agreement with respect to (i) creation or perfection of any
security interest in or (ii) control of security entitlements maintained in any
of the Designated Accounts or purporting to limit or condition the obligation of
the Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders with respect to
financial assets credited to any Designated Account as set forth in Section 3
hereof without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent acting in its
sole discretion. In the event of any conflict with respect to control over any
Designated Account between this Control Agreement (or any portion hereof) and
any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this
Control Agreement shall prevail. No amendment or modification of this Control
Agreement or waiver of any

                                      -3-

rights hereunder shall be binding on any party hereto unless it is in writing
and is signed by all the parties hereto.

                  Section 7. Certain Agreements.

                  (i)      The Securities Intermediary has furnished to the
Collateral Agent the most recent account statement issued by the Securities
Intermediary with respect to each of the Designated Accounts and the financial
assets and cash balances held therein, identifying the financial assets held
therein in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent. Each such
statement accurately reflects the assets held in such Designated Account as of
the date thereof.

                  (ii)     The Securities Intermediary will, upon its receipt of
each supplement to the Security Agreement signed by the Pledgor and identifying
one or more financial assets as "Pledged Collateral," enter into its records,
including computer records, with respect to each Designated Account a notation
with respect to any such financial asset so that such records and reports
generated with respect thereto identify such financial asset as "Pledged."

                  (iii)    The Collateral Agent has delivered to the Securities
Intermediary a list, signed by an authorized representative of the officers of
the Collateral Agent authorized to give approvals or instructions under this
Control Agreement (the "Authorized Representatives") and the Securities
Intermediary shall be entitled to rely on communications from any such
authorized officers until the earlier of the termination of this Control
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and notification by an Authorized
Representative of a change in such list at any time.

                  Section 8. Notice of Adverse Claims. Except for the claims
and interest of the Collateral Agent and of the Pledgor in the financial assets
maintained in the Designated Account(s), the Securities Intermediary on the date
hereof does not know of any claim to, or security interest in, any Designated
Account or in any financial asset credited thereto and does not know of any
claim that any person other than the Collateral Agent has been given "control"
(within the meaning of Section 8-106 of the UCC) of any Designated Account or
any such financial asset. If the Securities Intermediary becomes aware that any
person is asserting any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim (including any writ,
garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process or
any claim of control) against any of the financial assets maintained in any
Designated Account, the Securities Intermediary promptly notify the Collateral
Agent and the Pledgor thereof.

                  Section  9. Maintenance of Designated Accounts. In addition to
the obligations of the Securities Intermediary in Section 3 hereof, the
Securities Intermediary agrees to maintain the Designated Accounts as follows:

                  (i)      Notice of Sole Control. If at any time the Collateral
         Agent delivers to the Securities Intermediary a notice of sole control
         in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A
<PAGE>

                                      -4-

         attached hereto (the "Notice of Sole Control") with respect to any
         Designated Account, the Securities Intermediary agrees that, after
         receipt of such notice, it will take all instructions with respect to
         such Designated Account solely from the Collateral Agent and cease
         taking instructions from Pledgor, including, without limitation,
         instructions for investment, distribution or transfer of any financial
         asset maintained in any Designated Account. Permitting settlement of
         trades pending at the time of receipt of such notice shall not
         constitute a violation of the immediately preceding sentence.

                  (ii)     Voting Rights. Until such time as the Securities
         Intermediary receives a Notice of Sole Control, the Pledgor, or an
         investment manager on behalf of the Pledgor, shall direct the
         Securities Intermediary with respect to the voting of any financial
         assets credited to any Designated Account.

                  (iii)    Statements and Confirmations. The Securities
         Intermediary will send copies of all statements and other
         correspondence (excluding routine confirmations) concerning any
         Designated Account or any financial assets credited thereto
         simultaneously to each of the Pledgor and the Collateral Agent at the
         address set forth in Section 11 hereof. The Securities Intermediary
         will provide to the Collateral Agent, upon the Collateral Agent's
         request therefor from time to time and, in any event, as of the last
         business day of each calendar month, a statement of the market value of
         each financial asset maintained in each Designated Account. The
         Securities Intermediary shall not change the name or account number of
         any Designated Account without the prior written consent of the
         Collateral Agent.

                  (iv)     Bailee for Perfection. The Securities Intermediary
         acknowledges that, in the event that it should come into possession of
         any certificate representing any security or other assets held as
         financial assets in any of the Designated Accounts, the Securities
         Intermediary shall retain possession of the same for the benefit of the
         Collateral Agent and such act shall cause the Securities Intermediary
         to be deemed a bailee for the Collateral Agent, if necessary to perfect
         the Collateral Agent's security interest in such securities or assets.
         The Securities Intermediary hereby acknowledges its receipt of a copy
         of the Security Agreement, which shall also serve as notice to the
         Securities Intermediary of a security interest in collateral held by a
         bailee.

                  Section  10. Successors; Assignment. The terms of this Control
Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties
hereto and their respective corporate successors and permitted assignees.

                  Section  11. Notices. Any notice, request or other
communication required or permitted to be given under this Control Agreement
shall be in writing and deemed to have been properly given when delivered in
person, or when sent by telecopy or other electronic means and electronic
confirmation of error free receipt is received or two (2) days after being sent
by certi-

                  Section 12. Termination. The rights and powers granted herein
to the Collateral Agent are powers coupled with an interest and will be affected

                                    [Form of]

                  CONTROL AGREEMENT CONCERNING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS

                  This CONTROL AGREEMENT CONCERNING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS (this
"Control Agreement"), dated as of [   ], by and among [   ] (the "Pledgor"), UBS
AG, STAMFORD BRANCH (the "Collateral Agent") and [   ] (the "Bank"), is
delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(b) of that certain security agreement (as
amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, the "Security Agreement"), dated as of February 13, 2004, made by the
Pledgor and each of the Guarantors listed on the signature pages thereto in
favor of UBS AG, STAMFORD BRANCH, as collateral agent, as pledgee, assignee and
secured party (the "Collateral Agent"). This Control Agreement is for the
purpose of perfecting the security interests of the Secured Parties granted by
the Pledgor in the Designated Accounts described below. All references herein to
the "UCC" shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time
in the State of New York. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Security Agreement.

                  Section 1. Confirmation of Establishment and Maintenance of
Designated Accounts. The Bank hereby confirms and agrees that (i) the Bank has
established for the Pledgor and maintains the deposit account(s) listed in
Schedule 1 annexed hereto (such account(s), together with each such other
deposit account maintained by the Pledgor with the Bank collectively, the
"Designated Accounts" and each a "Designated Account"), (ii) each Designated
Account will be maintained in the manner set forth herein until termination of
this Control Agreement, (iii) the Bank is a "bank," as such term is defined in
the UCC, (iv) this Control Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation
of the Bank and (v) each Designated Account is a "deposit account" as such term
is defined in Article 9 of the UCC.

                  Section 2. Control. The Bank shall comply with instructions
originated by the Collateral Agent without further consent of the Pledgor or any
person acting or purporting to act for the Pledgor being required, including,
without limitation, directing disposition of the funds in each Designated
Account. The Bank shall also comply with instructions directing the disposition
of funds in each Designated Account originated by the Pledgor or its authorized
representatives until such time as the Collateral Agent delivers a Notice of
Sole Control pursuant to Section 8(i) hereof to the Bank.

                  Section 3. Subordination of Lien; Waiver of Set-Off. The Bank
hereby agrees that any security interest in any Designated Account it now has or
subsequently obtains

<PAGE>

                                      -2-

shall be subordinate to the security interest of the Collateral Agent. The funds
deposited into any Designated Account will not be subject to deduction, set-off,
banker's lien, or any other right in favor of any person other than the Secured
Parties (except that the Bank may set off (i) all amounts due to the Bank in
respect of its customary fees and expenses for the routine maintenance and
operation of the Designated Accounts, including overdraft fees, and (ii) the
face amount of any checks or other items which have been credited to any
Designated Account but are subsequently returned unpaid because of uncollected
or insufficient funds).

                  Section 4. Choice of Law. Both this Control Agreement and the
Designated Account(s) shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for purposes of the UCC, New
York shall be deemed to be the Bank's jurisdiction and the Designated Account(s)
shall be governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  Section 5. Conflict with Other Agreements; Amendments.
As of the date hereof, there are no other agreements entered into between the
Bank and the Pledgor with respect to any Designated Account or any funds
credited thereto (other than standard and customary documentation with respect
to the establishment and maintenance of such Designated Accounts). The Bank and
the Pledgor will not enter into any other agreement with respect to any
Designated Account unless the Collateral Agent shall have received prior written
notice thereof. The Bank and the Pledgor have not and will not enter into any
other agreement with respect to control of the Designated Accounts or purporting
to limit or condition the obligation of the Bank to comply with any orders or
instructions with respect to any Designated Account as set forth in Section 2
hereof without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent acting in its
sole discretion. In the event of any conflict with respect to control over any
Designated Account between this Control Agreement (or any portion hereof) and
any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this
Control Agreement shall prevail. No amendment or modification of this Control
Agreement or waiver of any right hereunder shall be binding on any party hereto
unless it is in writing and is signed by all the parties hereto.

                  Section 6. Certain Agreements.

                  (i)      The Bank has furnished to the Collateral Agent the
         most recent account statement issued by the Bank with respect to each
         of the Designated Accounts and the cash balances held therein. Each
         such statement accurately reflects the assets held in such Designated
         Account as of the date thereof.

                 (ii)      The Collateral Agent has delivered to the Bank a list
         , signed by an authorized representative, of the officers of the
         Collateral Agent authorized to give approvals or instructions under
         this Control Agreement (the "Authorized Representatives") and the Bank
         shall be entitled to rely on communications from any such authorized
         officers until the earlier of the termination of this Control Agreement
         in accordance with the terms

<PAGE>

                                      -3-

         hereof and notification by an Authorized Representative of a change in
         such list at any time.

                  Section 7. Notice of Adverse Claims. Except for the claims and
interest of the Secured Parties and of the Pledgor in the Designated Account(s),
the Bank on the date hereof does not know of any claim to, or security interest
in, any Designated Account or in any funds credited thereto and does not know of
any claim that any person other than the Collateral Agent has been given control
(within the meaning of Section 8-106 of the UCC) of any Designated Account or
any such funds. If the Bank becomes aware that any person is asserting any lien,
encumbrance or adverse claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant
of attachment, execution or similar process or any claim of control) against any
funds in any Designated Account, the Bank will promptly notify the Collateral
Agent and the Pledgor thereof.

                  Section 8. Maintenance of Designated Accounts. In addition to
the obligations of the Bank in Section 2 hereof, the Bank agrees to maintain the
Designated Accounts as follows:

                  (i)      Notice of Sole Control. If at any time the Collateral
         Agent delivers to the Bank a notice of sole control in substantially
         the form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Notice of Sole
         Control") with respect to any Designated Account, the Bank agrees that,
         after receipt of such notice, it will take all instruction with respect
         to such Designated Account solely from the Collateral Agent and cease
         taking instructions from the Pledgor, including, without limitation,
         instructions for distribution or transfer of any funds in any
         Designated Account.

                  (ii)     Statements and Confirmations. The Bank will send
         copies of all statements and other correspondence (excluding routine
         confirmations) concerning any Designated Account simultaneously to the
         Pledgor and the Collateral Agent at the address set forth in Section 10
         hereof. The Bank will promptly provide to the Collateral Agent, upon
         request therefor from time to time and, in any event, as of the last
         business day of each calendar month, a statement of the cash balance in
         each Designated Account. The Bank shall not change the name or account
         number of any Designated Account without the prior written consent of
         the Collateral Agent.

                  Section 9. Successors; Assignment. The terms of this Control
Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties
hereto and their respective corporate successors and permitted assignees.

                  Section 10. Notices. Any notice, request or other
communication required or permitted to be given under this Control Agreement
shall be in writing and deemed to have been properly given when delivered in

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  In connection with that certain Security Agreement, dated as
of February 13, 2004 (the "Security Agreement"), made by Ionics, Incorporated,
the Guarantors party thereto and UBS AG, Stamford Branch ("UBS") as Collateral
Agent, we have granted to UBS a security interest in substantially all of our
personal property, including our inventory.

                  This letter constitutes notice to you, and your signature

security interest in all goods with respect to which you are acting as bailee.
Until you are notified in writing to the contrary by UBS, however, you may
continue to accept instructions from us regarding the delivery of goods stored
by you.

                  Your acknowledgment also constitutes a waiver and release, for
UBS's benefit, of any and all claims, liens, including bailee's liens, and
demands of every kind which you have or may later have against such property
(including any right to include such property in any secured financing to which
you may become party).

                  In order to complete our records, kindly have a duplicate of
this letter signed by an officer of your company and return same to us at your
earliest convenience.

                                                                     EXHIBIT N-1

                                    [Form of]

                         OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL(1)

                  1.       Each Loan Party (a) is duly formed or organized and
validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has
all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and
as proposed to be conducted, to own and lease its property and to enter into
each Loan Document to which it is a party, perform its obligations thereunder,
borrow any amounts specified therein and give any guarantee and grant any
security interest contemplated thereby and (c) is qualified and in good standing
(to the extent such concept is applicable in the applicable jurisdiction) to do
business in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

                  2.       The Transactions to be entered into by each Loan
Party (including, without limitation, the execution, delivery and performance of
each Loan Document to which any such Loan Party is a party and the borrowings,
issuances of letters of credit, guarantees and uses of proceeds thereunder and
the granting of the security interests contemplated thereby) are within such
Loan Party's powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of such Loan Party. Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered
by each Loan Party which is a party to it and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable against each such Loan Party
in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally
and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law.

                  3.       The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or
approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any
Governmental Authority, except (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in
full force and effect, (ii) filings necessary to perfect Liens created by the
Loan Documents and (iii) consents, approvals, registrations, filings, permits or
actions the failure of which to obtain or perform could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate the
Organizational Documents of any Company or any judgment, decree or order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default or require
any consent or approval under any indenture, Organizational Document, agreement
or other instrument binding upon any Company or its property, or give rise to a
right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any Company, except for
violations, defaults or the creation of such rights that could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (d) will not result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any property of any Company, except Liens
created by the Loan Documents and Permitted Liens.

                  4.       To the knowledge of such counsel, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or before any Governmental
Authority now pending or threatened against or affecting any Company or any
business, property or rights of any Company (i) that involve any Loan Document
or the Transactions or (ii) as to which there is a reasonably possibility of an
adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

--------------------
(1)      Capitalized terms used and not defined herein are used with the
         meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  5.       No Company is engaged principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
buying or carrying Margin Stock. Neither the making of the Loans or the issuance
of Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the use of proceeds therefrom
or the pledge of the Securities Collateral (as defined in the Security
Agreement) pursuant to the Security Agreement will violate or be inconsistent
with the provisions of Regulation T, U or X.

                  6.       No Company is (a) an "investment company" or a
company "controlled" by an "investment company," as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (b) a
"holding company," an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," as defined in, or subject to regulation under,
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

                  7.       The Security Documents are effective to create in
favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, legal,
valid and enforceable Liens on and security interests in the Collateral which
security interest secures the Obligations.

                  8.       Each Financing Statement is in proper form for filing
in the [Office of Secretary of State of [Jurisdiction]], and upon the filing in
such office(s), the Collateral Agent will have fully perfected security
interests in that portion of Security Agreement Collateral in which a security
interest can be perfected by filing a financing statement under the UCC.

                  9.       Upon due filing of the Financing Statements in the
[Office of Secretary of State of [Jurisdiction]] and when the Security Agreement
or a short form thereof is filed in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and the United States Copyright Office, the Liens created by such
Security Agreement shall constitute fully perfected Liens on, and security
interests in, all right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in the
Intellectual Property Collateral (as defined in such Security Agreement), in
each case subject to no Liens other than Permitted Collateral Liens.

                  10.      Upon delivery to the Collateral Agent in the State of
New York of the certificates representing the Securities Collateral that are
required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security
Agreement (the "Pledged Securities"), the security interests in the Pledged
Securities in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, will be perfected. Assuming neither the Collateral Agent nor any of the
Secured Parties has notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of the UCC)
to the Pledged Securities, and the Collateral Agent takes delivery in registered
form, indorsed in blank by an effective indorsement or accompanied by undated
stock powers with respect thereto duly indorsed in blank by an effective
indorsement, the Collateral Agent will have control (within the meaning of the
UCC) of the Pledged Securities for the benefit of the Secured Parties under the
UCC and the Collateral Agent will acquire the security interest in the Pledged
Securities for the benefit of the Secured Parties free of any adverse claim.

                  11.      The provisions of the [Control Agreements] are
effective under the UCC to perfect the security interest in favor of the
Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in that portion of the
Security Agreement Collateral consisting of deposit accounts maintained with
[Applicable Bank] described in each such [Control Agreement]. The provisions of
the [Control Agreements] are effective under the UCC to perfect the security
interest in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, in that portion of the Security Agreement Collateral consisting of
commodities accounts and securities account maintained with [Applicable Bank]
described in each such [Control Agreement]. The Collateral Agent's security
interest in the [Account[s]] has priority over any other security interest in
the [Account[s]] assuming no other secured party has control of, and the absence
of any other control agreement with respect to, the [Account[s]].

<PAGE>

                  12.      There are to the best of our knowledge, no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, repurchase rights,
or other agreements or commitments of any nature relating to any of the Pledged
Securities or restricting the transfer thereof or voting thereunder and each of
the shares constituting Pledged Securities have been duly authorized and issued,
are fully paid and non-assessable and are free and clear of all liens.

                  13.      The Liens and the security interests created by the
Security Documents on the Security Agreement Collateral will validly secure the
payment of all future advances pursuant to the Credit Agreement, whether or not
at the time such advances are made an Event of Default or other event not within
the control of the Lenders has relieved or may relieve the Lenders from their
obligations to make such advances, and are perfected to the extent set forth in
paragraphs 7 through 11 above with respect to such future advances.

                  14.      A federal or state court sitting in New York will
honor the parties' choice of internal laws of the State of New York as the law
applicable to the Loan Documents (to the extent set forth in such Loan
Documents).

                  15.      No registration under the Securities Act is required
for the execution or performance by any Loan Party of the Loan Documents.

                  16.      There is no action, suit or proceeding before or by
any court, arbitrator or governmental agency, body or official, now pending or,
to the best of our knowledge, threatened, to which any of Borrower or any
Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or to which the business, assets or property of
any of them is subject which is not disclosed in the Loan Documents, which (a)
involves the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby or (b)
could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect.

                  In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to
matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of states in which
such counsel is admitted to practice, upon the opinion of other counsel to
Borrower satisfactory to the Agents (which opinion shall be dated and furnished
to the Lenders at the Closing Date, shall be satisfactory in form and substance
to the Agents and shall expressly state that the Lenders may rely on such
opinion as if it were addressed to them); provided that Loan Party counsel shall
state in their opinion that they believe that they and the Lenders are justified
in relying upon such opinion, and (B) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal
conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible
officers of Borrower and public officials. Such opinion may contain such
qualifications and assumptions as are customary for the Agents for transactions
of this type and are otherwise satisfactory to counsel for the Agents. Such
opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is
otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to
legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the
ABA Section of Business Law (1991).

                       FORM OF OPINION OF LOCAL COUNSEL

UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as Collateral Agent
and
The Lenders Party to the Credit
    Agreement Referred to Below

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  We have acted as special counsel in the State of
_______________ ( the "State") to Ionics, Incorporated., a Massachusetts
corporation (the "Company") the Subsidiary Guarantors (as hereinafter defined)
(the Subsidiary Guarantors, together with Company, being hereinafter referred to
collectively as the "Pledgors"), in connection with the execution and delivery
today of and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by (i) that
certain credit agreement dated as of ________, 2004 (as at any time amended,
amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"Credit Agreement"; capitalized terms used herein and not defined have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement), among the Company; the
Subsidiary Guarantors; the Lenders; UBS Securities LLC, as Lead Arranger, Sole
Bookmanager and Documentation Agent; UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as Issuing Bank,
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent; UBS Loan Finance LLC, as Swingline
Lender; and Fleet Securities, Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as
Syndication Agents and (ii) each of the Security Documents, including, without
limitation, the UCC-1 financing statements (collectively, the "Financing
Statements") relating to the Collateral naming the applicable Pledgor as debtor
thereunder and UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as collateral agent and secured party
thereunder (the "Collateral Agent").

                  In rendering the opinions hereinafter set forth, we have
reviewed final forms of the following documents (collectively, the
"Documents")(2):

(i)      the Credit Agreement;

(ii)     the Notes;

(iii)    a mortgage, assignment of leases and rents, security agreement and
         fixture filing, dated as of the date hereof (as at any time amended,
         the "Mortgage"), made by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary
         Guarantor in favor of the Collateral Agent;

----------------------
(1)      To the extent any Pledgor is organized in the State, add Notes,
         Guarantees and other corporate documents.

<PAGE>

                                      -2-

(iv)     UCC-1 financing statements identified in Schedule A attached hereto
         (collectively, the "Financing Statements") relating to the Mortgage;
         and

(v)      the other filings identified in Schedule A attached hereto
         (collectively, the "Other Filings") relating to the Mortgage.

                  We have reviewed the Documents and such other instruments,
documents and agreements as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable us
to render the opinions hereinafter set forth. We are rendering this opinion to
you at the request of our clients pursuant to Section 4.01(g) of the Credit
Agreement.

                  In rendering the opinions hereinafter set forth, we have
assumed that (i) there has occurred due execution and delivery of the Documents
and all documentation in connection therewith(2) and (ii) each of the Company
and/or the Subsidiary Guarantors owns the Mortgaged Property (as defined in the
Mortgage) pledged by it.

                  In addition, the opinions contained in Paragraphs 1 and 2
below are qualified to the extent that enforceability of the Mortgage may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other laws
relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity,
whether considered in an action at law or in equity.

                  Subject to the foregoing assumptions and qualifications, we
are of the opinion that:

1.       [Mortgage.](3) (a) The Mortgage (i) is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the mortgagor named therein, enforceable against the mortgagor
named therein in accordance with its terms, (ii) is in proper form under
applicable laws of the State to be accepted for recording by the County
Recorder[s] identified in Schedule A attached hereto and (iii) creates and
constitutes (A) a valid mortgage lien on that portion of the Mortgaged Property
that constitutes real property ("Real Property"), (B) a valid security interest
in such of the Mortgaged Property (as defined in the Mortgage) (the "UCC
Property") as is subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in the State of _______________ (the "UCC") and (C)
a valid common law lien on or pledge of such of the Mortgaged Property as is not
UCC Property or Real Property (such property, together with the UCC Property,
the "Personal Property") in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties (as defined in the Mortgage) securing the Secured Obligations
(as defined in the Mortgage).

(b)      The recording of the Mortgage with the County Recorder[s] identified in
Schedule A attached hereto is the only filing or recording necessary to give
constructive notice of the lien created by the Mortgage to subsequent purchasers
and mortgagees of the Real Property. No other recordings, filings, re-

--------------------
(2)      To the extent the Company and/or the Subsidiary Guarantors is organized
         in the state, delete assumption (i) and incorporate the opinions set
         forth in Exhibit A attached hereto.

(3)      Opinion to be delivered to the extent any Loan is entering into the
         Mortgage by virtue of having real property in the State.

<PAGE>

                                      -3-

recordings or refilings other than those identified in Schedule A are necessary
in order to maintain the validity or priority of the lien created by the
Mortgage.

(c)      Assuming that the Financing Statements relating to the Mortgage have
been properly filed with the offices identified in Schedule A attached hereto,
the security interest, lien or pledge created by the Mortgage in that portion of
the Mortgaged Property which constitutes fixtures and are subject to the
provisions of Article 9 of the UCC is duly perfected. Such Financing Statements
adequately identify such Mortgaged Property described therein to provide
sufficient notice to third parties of the security interest referenced therein.

(d)      The priority of the mortgage lien on the Real Property created by the
Mortgage with respect to any extension of credit or other amount (each, a
"Future Advance") secured thereby made or deemed to have been made after the
date of recording of the Mortgage will be the same as the priority of the
Mortgage applicable on such date of recording and such priority will not be
affected by the rights in and to the Real Property of any third party whose
interest in the Real Property attached thereto after the date of such recording
but prior to the date of such Future Advance. The priority of the lien of the
Mortgage will not be affected by (i) any prepayment of any portion of the Loans
or (ii) any increase in or reduction of the outstanding amount of the Loans from
time to time.]

2.       Taxes etc. [No taxes or other charges, including, without limitation,
intangible or documentary stamp taxes, recording taxes, transfer taxes or
similar charges, are payable to the State or to any jurisdiction therein on
account of the execution and delivery of the Documents or the creation of the
indebtedness evidenced or secured by any of the Documents or the recording or
filing of the Financing Statements or Other Filings, except for nominal filing
or recording fees.]

                                       OR

                  The recording taxes, documentary stamp taxes or note or
intangible taxes due and payable in connection with the subject transaction or
the recording of the Documents or the creation of the indebtedness evidenced or
secured by any of the Documents are as follows:

                          [insert amount of such taxes]

                  Any failure to pay such taxes in full or in part (i) shall not
result in the imposition of any penalty or interest on any unpaid taxes against
the Collateral Agent or the Lenders and (ii) shall not require the payment of
any unpaid taxes or any penalty or interest prior to the enforcement of the
Documents or otherwise prohibit, delay or limit the enforcement of the
Documents.

3.       Concerning Collateral Agent. (a) The execution, delivery, recordation
and performance by the Collateral Agent, the Lenders or the Company and/or the
Subsidiary Guarantors of the Documents to which each is a party (i) will not
violate any existing law, governmental rule or regulation of the State and (ii)
do not require any license, permit, authorization, consent or other approval of,
any exemption by, or any registration, recording or filing with, any court,
administrative agency or other governmental authority of the State, except for
the recordings and the filings set forth in Schedule A attached hereto.

(b)      Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of the Lenders is required (i) to
be qualified to transact business, file any designation for service of process,
file any reports or pay any taxes in the State or (ii) to

<PAGE>

                                      -4-

comply with any statutory or regulatory requirement applicable only to financial
institutions chartered or qualified to do business in the State, in each case,
solely by reason of the execution and delivery of any of the Documents or by
reason of the participation in any of the transactions under or contemplated by
the Documents including, without limitation, the making and receipt of payments
pursuant thereto and the exercise of any remedy thereunder. If it were
determined that any such qualification and filing were required, the validity of
the Documents would not be affected thereby, but if the Collateral Agent or the
Lenders were not qualified, the Collateral Agent, or the Lenders in the event
they institute remedies without the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, would
be precluded from enforcing their respective rights in the courts of the State
until such time as they are qualified to transact business in the State.
However, the lack of qualification would not result in any waiver of rights or
remedies pending such qualification.

(c)      Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of the Lenders shall be liable for
any loss, cost, expense or liability (including, without limitation, clean-up,
corrective action or response costs, penalties, fines or other impositions of
governmental agencies and judgments of private or public litigants) in respect
of any matter arising out of or relating to or under any Environmental Laws of
the State by reason of the execution and delivery of or participation in any of
the transactions under or contemplated by any of the Documents, including,
without limitation, the making and receipt of payments pursuant thereto and the
exercise of any remedy under any of the Documents. The laws of the State do not
provide for a statutory or regulatory lien in favor of any governmental entity
for liability under the Environmental Laws of the State.

4.       Usury. Assuming that the Documents are governed by the laws of the
State for the purpose of rendering the opinion set forth in this paragraph, none
of the provisions of the Documents (including, without limitation, the Secured
Obligations as defined in the Mortgage) will violate any law, statute or
regulation of the State relating to usury.

5.       Remedies.

(a)      The Collateral Agent is permitted under the laws of the State without
naming all of the Lenders in any applicable legal proceeding to exercise
remedies under the Security Documents for the realization of any of the
Mortgaged Property in its own name, as Collateral Agent.

(b)      The transfer of all or any portion of the Mortgaged Property in
connection with the exercise of any remedy under the Mortgage, including,
without limitation, by way of judicial foreclosure, will not restrict, affect or
impair the liability of the Pledgors with respect to the indebtedness secured
thereby or the beneficiary's rights or remedies to the foreclosure or
enforcement of any other security interest or liens securing such indebtedness.
The laws of the State do not require a lienholder to elect to pursue its
remedies either against mortgaged real property or personal property where such
lienholder holds security interests and liens on both real and personal property
of debtor.

(c)      The Mortgage contains the terms and provisions necessary to enable
Collateral Agent, following a default thereunder, to exercise the remedies which
are customarily available to a mortgage lienholder in the State of
_____________.

6.       Choice of Law. A state or Federal court in the State applying the
State's choice of law principles will give effect to the provisions in the
Documents which select the laws of the State of New York as the

<PAGE>

                                      -5-

governing law thereof and will apply such laws, rather than the laws of the
State, to the enforceability, construction and application thereof.

7.       Mortgaged Property. The present use and occupancy of the Mortgaged
Property complies in all respects with all applicable land use, subdivision,
building code and zoning rules and regulations affecting the Mortgaged Property.

                  We are admitted to practice in the State. We express no
opinion as to matters under or involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the laws of the United States and the State and its political subdivisions.

                  The foregoing opinions may be relied on by each of you, by any
successors and assigns of the Collateral Agent and by any participant, assignee
or successor to interests of the Lenders under the Documents.

                                         Very truly yours,

Guarantor(s)") has the requisite corporate or other organizational power and
authority, and has taken all necessary corporate or other organizational action,
to duly authorize the execution and delivery of each of the Documents to which

[State] Company and/or Subsidiary Guarantor(s) which is a party thereto and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each such [State] Company
and/or Subsidiary Guarantor(s).

(b)      Neither the execution, delivery or performance by any [State] Company
and/or Subsidiary Guarantor(s) of the Documents to which it is a party, nor
compliance with the terms and provisions thereof, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated therein (i) will contravene any applicable provision
of any law, statute, rule or regulation of [State] governmental authority or any
order, writ, injunction or decree of any [State] governmental authority or (ii)
will violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation, operating
agreement or by-laws of any [State] Company and/or Subsidiary Guarantor(s).

                   or any other Person on its behalf with respect to this Note;
                   and

holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be prejudiced in its right to enforce the
subordination of this Note by any act or failure to act on the part of any Payor
or by any act or failure to act on the part of such holder or any trustee or
agent for such holder. Each Payee and each Payor hereby agree that the
subordination of this Note is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent and the Lenders are obligees under this Note to the same extent as if
their names were written herein as such and the Administrative Agent may, on
behalf of the itself, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, proceed to enforce
the subordination provisions herein.

is not Borrower or a Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be subordinated to, and
shall rank pari passu in right of payment with, any other obligation of such
Payor.

above is intended to or will impair, as between each Payor and each Payee, the
obligations of such Payor, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay to such
Payee the principal of and interest on this Note as and when due and payable in
accordance with its terms, or is intended to or will affect the relative rights
of such Payee and other creditors of such Payor other than the holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

advances made by it to any Payor (all of which shall be evidenced by this Note),
and all repayments or prepayments thereof, in its books and records, such books
and records constituting prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information
contained therein.

                  Each Payor hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or
notice of any kind in connection with this Note. All payments under this Note
shall be made without offset, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
