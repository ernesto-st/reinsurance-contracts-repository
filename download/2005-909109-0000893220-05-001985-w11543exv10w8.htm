return of
excess loss reimbursements or advances which have been paid to the Company along with interest
thereon. Excess loss reimbursements or advances are those payments or advances made to the
Company by the SBA that are in excess of the Company&#146;s coverage under the Contract Year.
Excess loss reimbursements or advances may result from adjustments to the Projected Payout
Multiple or the Payout Multiple, incorrect exposure (Data Call) submissions or resubmissions,
incorrect calculations of Reimbursement Premiums or Retentions, incorrect Proof of Loss
Reports,
incorrect calculation of reinsurance recoveries, or subsequent readjustment of policyholder
claims,
including subrogation and salvage, or any combination of the foregoing. The Company will be
sent
an invoice showing the due date for adjustments along with the interest due thereon through the
due
date. The applicable interest rate for interest credits, and for interest charges for
adjustments beyond
the Company&#146;s control, will be the average rate earned by the SBA for the FHCF for the first
five
months of the Contract Year. The applicable interest rate for interest charges due to
adjustments
resulting from incorrect exposure submissions or Proof of Loss Reports will accrue at this rate
plus
5%. Interest will continue to accrue if not paid by the due date.</DIV>

    <TD>The Company shall, in a timely manner, pay the SBA its Reimbursement Premium for the Contract

    <TD>Since the calculation of the Actuarially Indicated Premium assumes that the Companies will pay
their Reimbursement Premiums timely, interest charges will accrue under the following
circumstances. A Company may choose to estimate its own Premium installments. However, if the
Company&#146;s estimation is less than the provisional Premium billed, an interest charge will
accrue on
the difference between the estimated Premium and the final Premium. If a Company estimates its
first installment, the Administrator shall bill that estimated Premium as the second
installment as
well, which will be considered as an estimate by the Company. No interest will accrue regarding
any provisional Premium if paid as billed by the FHCF&#146;s Administrator, except in the case of an
estimated second installment as set forth in this Article. Also, if a Company makes an
estimation
that is higher than the provisional Premium billed but is less than the final Premium, interest
will not
accrue. If the Premium payment is not received from a Company when it is due, an interest
charge
will accrue on a daily basis until the payment is received. Interest will also accrue on
Premiums
resulting from submissions or resubmissions finalized after December 1 of the Contract Year. An
interest credit will be applied for any Premium which is overpaid as either an estimate or as a
provisional Premium. Interest shall not be credited past December 1 of the Contract Year. The
applicable interest rate for interest credits will be the average rate earned by the SBA for
the FHCF</TD>
