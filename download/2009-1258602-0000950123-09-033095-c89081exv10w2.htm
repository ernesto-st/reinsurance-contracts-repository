the Conduit Lender that, prior to the date which is one year and one day (or, if longer, any
applicable preference period plus one day) after the payment in full of all outstanding
indebtedness of the Conduit Lender, it will not institute against or join any other Person or
entity in instituting against the Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceeding under the laws of the United
States or any state of the United States. The foregoing shall not limit the rights of the Funding
Note Issuer, the SPV Administrator, the Eligible Lender Trustee or the Conduit Administrator to
file any claim in, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any insolvency proceeding
instituted against the Conduit Lender by a Person other than the Funding Note Issuer, the SPV

payment and which funds are not required to repay its Securities when due and (ii)&nbsp;after giving
effect to such payment, either (x)&nbsp;the Conduit Lender could issue Securities to refinance all of
its outstanding Securities (assuming such outstanding Securities matured at such time) in
accordance with the program documents governing the Conduit Lender&#146;s Securities issuance program or
(y)&nbsp;all of the Conduit Lender&#146;s Securities are paid in full. Any amount which a Conduit Lender
does not pay pursuant to the operation of the preceding sentence shall not constitute a claim (as
defined in &#167;101 of the Bankruptcy Code) against or corporate obligation of the Conduit Lender for
any such insufficiency unless and until the Conduit Lender satisfies the provisions of

note that current 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1082(m)(1)(E) conflicts with 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1087-2(d)(3), in that the
former section requires that security interests in loans made under that part of the Higher
Education Act be perfected in the manner in which a security interest in accounts would be
perfected under applicable state law (or in the case of an outright sale, upon attachment as
defined under applicable state law), while the latter section allows perfection either in such
manner or by possession of the promissory note. Although we believe that a court should resolve
the conflict in favor of the more recently adopted provision, we express no opinion as to the
effect of any security interest in Student Loans perfected by possession under 20 U.S.C. &#167;
1087-2(d)(3). In addition, although the amendments to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1082(m)(1) do not contain any
transition provisions, we express no opinion as to the effect of any security interest in Student
Loans perfected prior to the effective date of such amendment by possession of the original or a
copy of a master promissory note. A possible effect of the quoted provisions is that a party who
has perfected a security interest by possession of a copy of a master promissory note may take
priority over the security interest in favor of the Seller, the Conduit Lender and any ELT.
