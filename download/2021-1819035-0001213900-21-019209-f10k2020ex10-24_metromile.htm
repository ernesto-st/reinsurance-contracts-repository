from Service for a maximum of twelve (12) months, either by reimbursing you for or paying directly (at the Company&rsquo;s discretion)
your COBRA premiums to continue such coverage (the &ldquo;<B>COBRA Severance</B>&rdquo;). The Company's obligation to pay the COBRA
Severance on your behalf will cease if you obtain health care coverage from another source (e.g., a new employer or spouse&rsquo;s
benefit plan), unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. You must notify the Company within two (2) weeks if you obtain coverage
from a new source. This payment of COBRA Severance by the Company would not expand or extend the maximum period of COBRA coverage
to which you would otherwise be entitled under applicable law. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company determines in its sole
discretion that it cannot provide the foregoing COBRA Severance without potentially violating applicable law (including, without
limitation, Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act), the Company shall in lieu thereof provide to you a taxable monthly
payment in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium that you would be required to pay to continue your group health coverage
in effect on the date of your termination (which amount shall be based on the premium for the first month of COBRA coverage), which
payments shall be made on the last day of each month regardless of whether you elect COBRA continuation coverage and shall end
on the earlier of (x) the date upon which you obtain other coverage or (y) the last day of the twelfth (12<SUP>th</SUP>) calendar
month following your Separation from Service date.</P>

Qualifying Termination in Connection with a Change of Control.</B> In the event of a Qualifying Termination that occurs

below), provided such Qualifying Termination constitutes a Separation from Service, then subject to Sections 10

Activities.</B> Throughout your employment with the Company, you may engage in civic and not- for-profit activities so long as

During your employment by the Company, except on behalf of the Company, you will not directly or indirectly serve as an officer,
director, stockholder, employee, partner, proprietor, investor, joint venturer, associate, representative or consultant of any
other person, corporation, firm, partnership or other entity whatsoever known by you to compete with the Company (or is planning

in) by the Company; provided, however, that you may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not more than) one percent (1%) of
any class of securities of any enterprise (but without participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are

involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; (b) commission or attempted commission of or participation in a fraud or act of
dishonesty or misrepresentation against the Company; (c) material breach of your duties to the Company; (d) intentional damage
to any property of the Company causing material harm to the Company; (e) gross misconduct, or other material violation of Company
policy that causes, or reasonably could be anticipated to cause, harm; (f) material violation of any written and fully executed
contract or agreement between you and the Company, including without limitation, material breach of your Confidentiality Agreement,
or of any Company policy, or of any statutory duty you owe to the Company; or (g) conduct which in the good faith and reasonable
determination of the Company demonstrates gross unfitness to serve. The determination that a termination is for Cause shall be
made by the Company in its sole discretion.</P>

Reason</B>&rdquo; for resigning from employment with the Company if any of the following actions are taken by the Company
without your prior written consent: (a) a material reduction in your base salary, which the parties agree is a reduction of
at least 25% of your base salary (unless pursuant to a salary reduction program applicable generally to the Company&rsquo;s
similarly situated employees); (b) a material reduction in your duties (including responsibilities and/or authorities), <I>provided,
however</I>, that a change in job position (including a change in title) shall not be deemed a &ldquo;material
reduction&rdquo; in and of itself unless your new duties are materially reduced from the prior duties; or (c) relocation of
your principal place of employment to a place that increases your one-way commute by more than fifty (50) miles as compared
to your then-current principal place of employment immediately prior to such relocation. In order to resign for Good Reason,
you must provide written notice to the Board within 30 days after the first occurrence of the event giving rise to Good
Reason setting forth the basis for your resignation, allow the Company at least 30 days from receipt of such written notice
to cure such event, and if such event is not reasonably cured within such period, you must resign from all positions you then
hold with the Company not later than 30 days after the expiration of the cure period.</P>

with Section 409A.</B> It is intended that the Non-CIC Severance Benefits, the CIC Severance Benefits, and the Accelerated Vesting,
as applicable, satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, (the &ldquo;<B>Code</B>&rdquo;) (Section 409A, together with any state law of similar effect, &ldquo;<B>Section
409A</B>&rdquo;) provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A- 1(b)(4), 1.409A-1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9). For purposes of Section
409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulations 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), your right to receive any installment
payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive
a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate
and distinct payment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company (or, if applicable, the successor
entity thereto) determines that the Non-CIC Severance Benefits, the CIC Severance Benefits, and the Accelerated Vesting, as applicable,
constitute &ldquo;deferred compensation&rdquo; under Section 409A and you are, on the date of your Separation from Service, a &ldquo;specified
employee&rdquo; of the Company or any successor entity thereto, as such term is defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code
(a &ldquo;<B>Specified Employee</B>&rdquo;), then, solely to the extent necessary to avoid the incurrence of adverse personal tax
consequences under Section 409A, the timing of the Non-CIC Severance Benefits, the CIC Severance Benefits, and the Accelerated
Vesting, as applicable, shall be delayed until the earliest of: (i) the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after your
Separation from Service date, (ii) the date of your death, or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the
imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)
period, all payments or benefits deferred pursuant to this Section shall be paid in a lump sum or provided in full by the Company
(or the successor entity thereto, as applicable), and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. No
interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. If the Non-CIC Severance Benefits, the CIC Severance Benefits, or the Accelerated
Vesting, as applicable, are not covered by one or more exemptions from the application of Section 409A and the Release could become
effective in the calendar year following the calendar year in which you have a Separation from Service, the Release will not be
deemed effective any earlier than the Release Deadline. The Non-CIC Severance Benefits, the CIC Severance Benefits, and the Accelerated
Vesting, as applicable, Non-CIC Severance Benefits, the CIC Severance Benefits, and the Accelerated Vesting, as applicable, are
intended to qualify for an exemption from application of Section 409A or comply with its requirements to the extent necessary to
avoid adverse personal tax consequences under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.
</FONT>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent required to comply with Section 409A, a termination of employment
shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of amounts or benefits
upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a &ldquo;separation from service&rdquo; within the
meaning of Section 409A. With respect to reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided to you hereunder (or otherwise) that are not
exempt from Section 409A, the following rules shall apply: (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits
provided, during any one of your taxable years shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefit to
be provided in any other taxable year, (ii) in the case of any reimbursements of eligible expenses, reimbursement shall be made
on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred, (iii) the right to
reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.</P>

any payment or benefit you will or may receive from the Company or otherwise (a &ldquo;<B>280G Payment</B>&rdquo;) would (i) constitute
a &ldquo;parachute payment&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to
the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the &ldquo;<B>Excise Tax</B>&rdquo;), then any such 280G Payment provided pursuant
to this Agreement (a &ldquo;<B>Payment</B>&rdquo;) shall be equal to the Reduced Amount. The &ldquo;Reduced Amount&rdquo; shall
be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment (after reduction) being subject

determined by clause (x) or by clause (y)), after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes,
income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in your receipt, on an after-tax
basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax.
If a reduction in a Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is determined pursuant to clause
(x) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the &ldquo;<B>Reduction Method</B>&rdquo;) that results
in the greatest economic benefit for you. If more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items
so reduced will be reduced pro rata (the &ldquo;<B>Pro Rata Reduction Method</B>&rdquo;).</P>

to Section 409A, then the Reduction Method and/or the Pro Rata Reduction Method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to
avoid the imposition of taxes pursuant to Section 409A as follows: (A) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to
the greatest extent possible, the greatest economic benefit for you as determined on an after-tax basis; (B) as a second priority,
Payments that are contingent on future events (e.g., being terminated without Cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments
that are not contingent on future events; and (C) as a third priority, Payments that are &ldquo;deferred compensation&rdquo; within

ensure the rapid and economical resolution of disputes that may arise in connection with your employment with the Company,
you and the Company agree that any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action, in law or equity, including but not limited
to statutory claims, arising from or relating to the enforcement, breach, performance, or interpretation of this Agreement,
your employment with the Company, or the termination of your employment, shall be resolved pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect; 1-16, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by final, binding and confidential arbitration
conducted by JAMS, Inc. or its successor (&ldquo;<B><I>JAMS</I></B>&rdquo;), under JAMS&rsquo; then applicable rules and
procedures for employment disputes before a single arbitrator (available upon request and also currently available at <U>http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/</U>). <B>You
acknowledge that by agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both you and the Company waive the right to resolve any such
dispute through a trial by jury or judge or administrative proceeding.</B> In addition, all claims, disputes, or causes of
action under this section, whether by you or the Company, must be brought in an individual capacity, and shall not be brought
as a plaintiff (or claimant) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, nor joined or consolidated
with the claims of any other person or entity. The arbitrator may not consolidate the claims of more than one person or
entity, and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. To the extent that the preceding sentences
regarding class claims or proceedings are found to violate applicable law or are otherwise found unenforceable, any claim(s)
alleged or brought on behalf of a class shall proceed in a court of law rather than by arbitration. This paragraph shall not
apply to any action or claim that cannot be subject to mandatory arbitration as a matter of law, including, without
limitation, claims brought pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, as amended, the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act, as amended, and the California Labor Code, as amended, to the extent such claims are not
permitted by applicable law to be submitted to mandatory arbitration and such applicable law(s) are not preempted by the
Federal Arbitration Act or otherwise invalid (collectively, the &ldquo;<B><I>Excluded Claims</I></B>&rdquo;). In the event
you intend to bring multiple claims, including one of the Excluded Claims listed above, the Excluded Claims may be publicly
filed with a court, while any other claims will remain subject to mandatory arbitration. You will have the right to be
represented by legal counsel at any arbitration proceeding. Questions of whether a claim is subject to arbitration under this
agreement shall be decided by the arbitrator. Likewise, procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on the
final disposition are also matters for the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall: (a) have the authority to compel adequate
discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be permitted by law; and (b) issue a
written statement signed by the arbitrator regarding the disposition of each claim and the relief, if any, awarded as to each
claim, the reasons for the award, and the arbitrator&rsquo;s essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
The arbitrator shall be authorized to award all relief that you or the Company would be entitled to seek in a court of law.
The Company shall pay all JAMS arbitration fees in excess of the administrative fees that you would be required to pay if the
dispute were decided in a court of law. Nothing in this letter agreement is intended to prevent either you or the Company
from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration. Any
awards or orders in such arbitrations may be entered and enforced as judgments in the federal and state courts of any
competent jurisdiction.</P>

Company. It supersedes any other agreements or promises made to you by anyone, whether oral or written. Changes in your employment
terms, other than those changes expressly reserved to the Company&rsquo;s or the Board&rsquo;s discretion in this Agreement, require
a written modification approved by the Company and signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company (other than you). This Agreement
will bind the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of both you and the Company, and inure to the benefit of
both you and the Company, their heirs, successors and assigns. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid
or unenforceable, in whole or in part, this determination shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and the provision
in question shall be modified so as to be rendered enforceable in a manner consistent with the intent of the parties insofar as
possible under applicable law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California
without regard to conflicts of law principles. Any ambiguity in this Agreement shall not be construed against either party as
the drafter. Any waiver of a breach of this Agreement, or rights hereunder, shall be in writing and shall not be deemed to be
a waiver of any successive breach or rights hereunder. This Agreement may be delivered and executed via facsimile, electronic
