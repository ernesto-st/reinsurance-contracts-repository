                                  ARTICLE VII

                               REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         7.1 DEMAND REGISTRATION.

                  (a) DEMAND REGISTRATION. At any time after the occurrence of a
Put Dishonor, upon the written request of the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities requesting that State Auto Financial effect the
registration under the Securities Act of all or part of such holders'
Registrable Securities and specifying the number of Registrable Securities to be
registered and the intended method of disposition thereof (a "REGISTRATION
REQUEST"), State Auto Financial will promptly, and in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days after receipt of such Registration Request, give written
notice (a "NOTICE OF DEMAND REGISTRATION") of such request to all other holders
of Registrable Securities, and thereupon will use its best efforts to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of:

                           (i) the Registrable Securities which State Auto
         Financial has been so requested to register by such holders of a
         majority of the Registrable Securities; and

                           (ii) all other Registrable Securities the holders of
         which have made written requests to State Auto Financial for
         registration thereof within 20 days after the giving of the Notice of
         Demand Registration (which requests shall specify the intended method
         of disposition thereof),

all to the extent requisite to permit the disposition (in accordance with the
intended methods thereof) of the Registrable Securities so to be registered. If
requested by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities requested
to be included in any Demand Registration, the method of disposition of all
Registrable Securities included in such registration shall be an underwritten
offering effected in accordance with SECTION 7.4(a) hereof. Subject to paragraph
(e) of this SECTION 7.1, State Auto Financial may include in such registration
other securities for sale for its own account or for the account of any other
Person. If any security holders of State Auto Financial (other than the holders
of Registrable Securities in such capacity) register securities of State Auto
Financial in a Demand Registration in accordance with this SECTION 7.1, such
holders shall pay the fees and expenses of their counsel and their pro rata
share, on the basis of the respective amounts of the securities included in such
registration on behalf of each such holder, of the Registration Expenses if the
Registration Expenses for such registration are not paid by State Auto Financial
for any reason.

                  (b) LIMITATIONS ON DEMAND REGISTRATIONS. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, State Auto Financial shall not be required to
honor a request for a Demand Registration if:

                           (i) a Put Dishonor shall not have occurred;

                           (ii) in the case of a Long-Form Registration, State
         Auto Financial has previously effected one Effective Long-Form
         Registration;



                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

                           (iii) in the case of a Short-Form Registration, State
         Auto Financial has previously effected one Effective Short-Form
         Registration; or

                           (iv) such request is received by State Auto Financial
         less than 90 days following the effective date of any previous
         registration statement filed in connection with a Demand Registration,
         regardless of whether any holder of Registrable Securities exercised
         its rights under this Agreement with respect to such registration.

                  (c) REGISTRATION STATEMENT FORM. Demand Registrations shall be
on such appropriate registration form promulgated by the Commission as shall be
selected by State Auto Financial, and shall be reasonably acceptable to the
holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to which such registration
relates, and shall permit the disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method or methods specified in their request for
such registration; PROVIDED that such registration form is available under the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if State Auto Financial
selects a Form S-3 and the use of such form is available under the terms of this
Agreement and is permitted by law, the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities to which such registration relates may notify State Auto Financial in
writing that, in the judgment of such holders (or, if applicable, the Managing
Underwriter), the inclusion of some or all of the information required in a more
detailed form specified in such notice is of material importance to the success
of the Public Offering of such Registrable Securities, in which case State Auto
Financial shall supplement or amend the Form S-3 to include such information.

                  (d) REGISTRATION EXPENSES. State Auto Financial will pay all
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any Demand Registration.

                  (e) PRIORITY IN CUTBACK REGISTRATIONS. If a Demand
Registration becomes a Cutback Registration, State Auto Financial will include
in any such registration to the extent of the number which the Managing
Underwriter advises State Auto Financial can be sold in such offering (i) FIRST,
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration by the
Requesting Holders, pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be included by such holders and (ii) SECOND, other
securities of State Auto Financial proposed to be included in such registration,
allocated among the holders thereof in accordance with the priorities then
existing among State Auto Financial and the holders of such other securities;
and any securities so excluded shall be withdrawn from and shall not be included
in such Demand Registration.

         7.2 PIGGYBACK REGISTRATIONS.

                  (a) RIGHT TO INCLUDE REGISTRABLE SECURITIES. If, at any time
after the occurrence of a Put Dishonor, State Auto Financial at any time
proposes after any shares of Class A Preferred Stock have been purchased
hereunder to effect a Piggyback Registration, it will each such time give prompt
written notice (a "NOTICE OF PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION"), at least 30 days prior to
the anticipated filing date, to all holders of Registrable Securities of its
intention to do so and of such holders' rights under this SECTION 7.2, which
Notice of Piggyback Registration shall include a description of the intended
method of disposition of such securities. Upon the written request of any such
holder made within 15 days after receipt of a Notice of



                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

Piggyback Registration (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such holder and the intended method of disposition
thereof), State Auto Financial will use its best efforts to include in the
registration statement relating to such Piggyback Registration all Registrable
Securities which State Auto Financial has been so requested to register.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time after giving a Notice of
Piggyback Registration and prior to the effective date of the registration
statement filed in connection with such registration, State Auto Financial shall
determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such
securities, State Auto Financial may, at its election, give written notice of
such determination to each holder of Registrable Securities and, thereupon, (i)
in the case of a determination not to register, shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
registration (but not from its obligation to pay the Registration Expenses in
connection therewith), without prejudice, however, to the rights of any
Requesting Holder entitled to do so to request that such registration be
effected as a Demand Registration under SECTION 7.1 hereof, and (ii) in the case
of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering
any Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in registering such
other securities. No registration effected under this SECTION 7.2 shall relieve
State Auto Financial of its obligations to effect a Demand Registration under
SECTION 7.1 hereof.

                  (b) REGISTRATION EXPENSES. State Auto Financial will pay all
 Registration Expenses incurred in connection with each Piggyback Registration.

                  (c) PRIORITY IN CUTBACK REGISTRATIONS. If a Piggyback
Registration becomes a Cutback Registration, State Auto Financial will include
in such registration to the extent of the amount of the securities which the
Managing Underwriter advises State Auto Financial can be sold in such offering:

                           (i) if such registration as initially proposed by
         State Auto Financial was solely a primary registration of its
         securities, (x) FIRST, the securities proposed by State Auto Financial
         to be sold for its own account, and (y) SECOND any Registrable
         Securities requested to be included in such registration by Requesting
         Holders, PRO RATA on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities
         requested to be included by such holders, and (z) THIRD, any other
         securities of State Auto Financial proposed to be included in such
         registration, allocated among the holders thereof in accordance with
         the priorities then existing among State Auto Financial and such
         holders; and

                           (ii) if such registration as initially proposed by
         State Auto Financial was in whole or in part requested by holders of
         securities of State Auto Financial, other than holders of Registrable
         Securities in their capacities as such, pursuant to demand registration
         rights, (x) FIRST, such securities held by the holders initiating such
         registration and, if applicable, any securities proposed by State Auto
         Financial to be sold for its own account, allocated in accordance with
         the priorities then existing among State Auto Financial and such
         holders, and (y) SECOND any Registrable Securities requested to be
         included in such registration by Requesting Holders, PRO RATA on the
         basis of the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included
         by such holders, and (z) THIRD, any other securities of State Auto
         Financial proposed to be included in such registration, allocated among
         the holders thereof in accordance with the priorities then existing
         among State Auto Financial and the holders of such other securities;



                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>

and any securities so excluded shall be withdrawn from and shall not be included
in such Piggyback Registration.

         7.3 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. If and whenever State Auto Financial is
required to use its best efforts to effect the registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to SECTION 7.1 or 7.2 hereof, State
Auto Financial will use its best efforts to effect the registration and sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition thereof specified by the Requesting Holders. Without limiting the
foregoing, State Auto Financial in each such case will, as expeditiously as
possible:

                  (a) prepare and file with the Commission the requisite
registration statement to effect such registration and use its best efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable,
PROVIDED that as far in advance as practical before filing such registration
statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, State Auto Financial will
furnish to the Requesting Holders copies of reasonably complete drafts of all
such documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits), and any such holder
shall have the opportunity to object to any information pertaining solely to
such holder that is contained therein and State Auto Financial will make the
corrections reasonably requested by such holder with respect to such information
prior to filing any such registration statement or amendment;

                  (b) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and any prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect
to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement, in accordance with the intended methods of disposition thereof, until
the earlier of (i) such time as all of such securities have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers
thereof set forth in such registration statement and (ii) 180 days after such
registration statement becomes effective;

                  (c) promptly notify each Requesting Holder and the underwriter
or underwriters, if any

                           (i) when such registration statement or any
         prospectus used in connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement
         thereto, has been filed and, with respect to such registration
         statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has
         become effective;

                           (ii) of any written request by the Commission for
         amendments or supplements to such registration statement or prospectus;

                           (iii) of the notification to State Auto Financial by
         the Commission of its initiation of any proceeding with respect to the
         issuance by the Commission of, or of the issuance by the Commission of,
         any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration
         statement (and State Auto Financial shall promptly attempt to have such
         order withdrawn); and



                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>

                           (iv) of the receipt by State Auto Financial of any
         notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
         Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue
         sky laws of any jurisdiction;

                  (d) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities covered
by such registration statement such number of conformed copies of such
registration statement and of each amendment and supplement thereto (in each
case including all exhibits and documents incorporated by reference), such
number of copies of the prospectus contained in such registration statement
(including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) and any other
prospectus filed under Rule 424 promulgated under the Securities Act relating to
such holder's Registrable Securities, and such other documents, as such seller
may reasonably request to facilitate the disposition of its Registrable
Securities;

                  (e) use its best efforts to register or qualify all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement under such other
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as each holder thereof shall
reasonably request, to keep such registration or qualification in effect for so
long as such registration statement remains in effect, and take any other action
which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such holder to
consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities
owned by such holder, except that State Auto Financial shall not for any such
purpose be required (i) to qualify generally to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of
this paragraph (e) be obligated to be so qualified, (ii) to subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) to consent to general service of
process in any jurisdiction;

                  (f) use its best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such
other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable each
holder thereof to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

                  (g) furnish to each Requesting Holder a signed counterpart
addressed to such holder (and the underwriters, if any), of

                           (i) an opinion of counsel for State Auto Financial,
         dated the effective date of such registration statement (or, if such
         registration includes an underwritten Public Offering, dated the date
         of any closing under the underwriting agreement), reasonably
         satisfactory in form and substance to such holder, and

                           (ii) a "comfort" letter, dated the effective date of
         such registration statement (and, if such registration includes an
         underwritten Public Offering, dated the date of any closing under the
         underwriting agreement), signed by the independent public accountants
         who have certified State Auto Financial's financial statements included
         in such registration statement,

in each case covering substantially the same matters with respect to such
registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and, in the case of
the accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date of such
financial statements, as are customarily covered in opinions of issuer's counsel
and in accountants' letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten



                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

Public Offerings of securities and, in the case of the accountants' letter, such
other financial matters, as such holder (or the underwriters, if any) may
reasonably request;

                  (h) notify each holder of Registrable Securities covered by
such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event
as a result of which any prospectus included in such registration statement, as
then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and at the request of any such holder promptly prepare and
furnish to such holder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an
amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

                  (i) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
securityholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering the period of at least twelve (12) months, but not more than eighteen
(18) months, beginning with the first full calendar month after the effective
date of such registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated
thereunder;

                  (j) make available for inspection by any Requesting Holder,
any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration
statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such
seller or underwriter (collectively, the "INSPECTORS"), all financial and other
records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of State Auto Financial
(collectively, the "RECORDS") as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to
exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause State Auto Financial's
officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested
by any such Inspector in connection with such registration statement, and permit
the Inspectors to participate in the preparation of such registration statement
and any prospectus contained therein and any amendment or supplement thereto.
Records which State Auto Financial determines, in good faith, to be confidential
and which it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed by
the Inspectors unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid
or correct a misstatement or omission in the registration statement, (ii) the
release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a
court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) the information in such Records has
been made generally available to the public. The seller of Registrable
Securities agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Securities that it will,
upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, give notice to State Auto Financial and allow State Auto
Financial, at State Auto Financial's expense, to undertake appropriate action to
prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential;

                  (k) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement not later than the effective
date of such registration statement; and



                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

                  (l) use its best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement to be listed, upon official notice of
issuance, on any securities exchange on which any of the securities of the same
class as the Registrable Securities are then listed.

                  State Auto Financial may require each holder of Registrable
Securities as to which any registration is being effected to, and each such
holder, as a condition to including Registrable Securities in such registration,
shall, furnish State Auto Financial with such information and affidavits
regarding such holder and the distribution of such securities as State Auto
Financial may from time to time reasonably request in writing in connection with
such registration.

                  Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of
such Registrable Securities that upon receipt of any notice from State Auto
Financial of the happening of any event of the kind described in paragraph (h)
of this SECTION 7.3, such holder will forthwith discontinue such holder's
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement
relating to such Registrable Securities until such holder's receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by such paragraph
(h) and, if so directed by State Auto Financial, will deliver to State Auto
Financial (at State Auto Financial's expense) all copies, other than permanent
file copies, then in such holder's possession of the prospectus relating to such
Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the
event State Auto Financial shall give any such notice, the period referred to in
paragraph (b) of this SECTION 7.3 shall be extended by a number of days equal to
the number of days during the period from and including the giving of notice
pursuant to paragraph (h) of this SECTION 7.3 and to and including the date when
each holder of any Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement
shall receive the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated
by such paragraph (h).

         7.4 UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS.

                  (a) UNDERWRITTEN DEMAND OFFERINGS. In the case of any
underwritten Public Offering being effected pursuant to a Demand Registration,
the Managing Underwriter and any other underwriter or underwriters with respect
to such offering shall be selected, after consultation with State Auto
Financial, by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be
included in such underwritten offering with the consent of State Auto Financial,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. State Auto Financial shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with such underwriter or
underwriters, which shall include, among other provisions, indemnities to the
effect and to the extent provided in SECTION 7.6 hereof and shall take all such
other actions as are reasonably requested by the Managing Underwriter in order
to expedite or facilitate the registration and disposition of the Registrable
Securities. The holders of Registrable Securities to be distributed by such
underwriters shall be parties to such underwriting agreement and may, at their
option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and
the other agreements on the part of, State Auto Financial to and for the benefit
of such underwriters also be made to and for their benefit and that any or all
of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to their obligations. No
holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to make any representations
or warranties to or agreements with State Auto Financial or the underwriters
other than representations, warranties



                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>

or agreements regarding such holder and its ownership of the securities being
registered on its behalf and such holder's intended method of distribution and
any other representation required by law. No Requesting Holder may participate
in such underwritten offering unless such holder agrees to sell its Registrable
Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting agreement and completes
and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities and other
documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. If
any Requesting Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such holder
may elect to withdraw therefrom and from such registration by notice to State
Auto Financial and the Managing Underwriter, and each of the remaining
Requesting Holders shall be entitled to increase the number of Registrable
Securities being registered to the extent of the Registrable Securities so
withdrawn in the proportion which the number of Registrable Securities being
registered by such remaining Requesting Holder bears to the total number of
Registrable Securities being registered by all such remaining Requesting
Holders.

                  (b) UNDERWRITTEN PIGGYBACK OFFERINGS. If State Auto Financial
at any time proposes to register any of its securities in a Piggyback
Registration and such securities are to be distributed by or through one or more
underwriters, State Auto Financial will, subject to the provisions of SECTION
7.2(c) hereof, use its best efforts, if requested by any holder of Registrable
Securities, to arrange for such underwriters to include the Registrable
Securities to be offered and sold by such holder among the securities to be
distributed by such underwriters, and such holders shall be obligated to sell
their Registrable Securities in such Piggyback Registration through such
underwriters on the same terms and conditions as apply to the other Company
securities to be sold by such underwriters in connection with such Piggyback
Registration. The holders of Registrable Securities to be distributed by such
underwriters shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between State Auto
Financial and such underwriter or underwriters and may, at their option, require
that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other
agreements on the part of, State Auto Financial to and for the benefit of such
underwriters also be made to and for their benefit and that any or all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to their obligations. No
holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to make any representations
or warranties to or agreements with State Auto Financial or the underwriters
other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding such holder and
its ownership of the securities being registered on its behalf and such holder's
intended method of distribution and any other representation required by law. No
Requesting Holder may participate in such underwritten offering unless such
holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such
underwriting agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting agreement. If any Requesting Holder disapproves of the terms
of an underwriting, such holder may elect to withdraw therefrom and from such
registration by notice to State Auto Financial and the Managing Underwriter, and
each of the remaining Requesting Holders shall be entitled to increase the
number of Registrable Securities being registered to the extent of the
Registrable Securities so withdrawn in the proportion which the number of
Registrable Securities being registered by such remaining Requesting Holder
bears to the total number of Registrable Securities being registered by all such
remaining Requesting Holders.

         7.5 HOLDBACK AGREEMENTS BY STATE AUTO FINANCIAL AND OTHER
SECURITYHOLDERS. Unless the Managing Underwriter otherwise agrees, State Auto
Financial and each holder of



                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>

Registrable Securities agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of
its equity securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for such securities, during the 14 days prior to and the 180 days
after the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with
an underwritten offering made pursuant to a Demand Registration (or for such
shorter period of time as is sufficient and appropriate, in the opinion of the
Managing Underwriter, in order to complete the sale and distribution of the
securities included in such registration), except as part of such underwritten
registration and except pursuant to registrations on Form S-4 or Form S-8
promulgated by the Commission or any successor or similar forms thereto. State
Auto Financial also agrees, unless the Managing Underwriter otherwise agrees, to
cause each holder of its equity securities which is a party to a registration
rights agreement with State Auto Financial entered into on or after the date
hereof, and each holder of its equity securities, or of any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, in each
case purchased from State Auto Financial, at any time after the date of this
Agreement (other than in a Public Offering), to agree, to the extent permitted
by law, not to effect any such public sale or distribution of such securities
(including a sale under Rule 144), during such period, except as part of such
underwritten registration.

         7.6 INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) INDEMNIFICATION BY STATE AUTO FINANCIAL. State Auto
Financial shall, to the full extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold
harmless each seller of Registrable Securities included in any registration
statement filed in connection with a Demand Registration or a Piggyback
Registration, its directors and officers, and each other Person, if any, who
controls any such seller within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, joint or several (together,
"LOSSES"), to which such seller or any such director or officer or controlling
Person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such
Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any such registration statement, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and State
Auto Financial will reimburse such seller and each such director, officer and
controlling Person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss (or action or
proceeding in respect thereof); PROVIDED that State Auto Financial shall not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such Loss (or action or
proceeding in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
any such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus,
summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to State Auto Financial through an instrument
duly executed by such seller specifically stating that it is for use in the
preparation thereof. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such seller or any such
director, officer or controlling Person, and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by such seller. State Auto Financial shall also indemnify each other
Person who participates (including as an underwriter) in the offering or sale of
Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and each other Person, if
any, who controls



                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>

any such participating Person within the meaning of the Securities Act to the
same extent as provided above with respect to sellers of Registrable Securities.

                  (b) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SELLERS. Each holder of Registrable
Securities which are included or are to be included in any registration
statement filed in connection with a Demand Registration or a Piggyback
Registration, as a condition to including Registrable Securities in such
registration statement, shall, to the full extent permitted by law, indemnify
and hold harmless State Auto Financial, its directors and officers, and each
other Person, if any, who controls State Auto Financial within the meaning of
the Securities Act, against any Losses to which State Auto Financial or any such
director or officer or controlling Person may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in any such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to State Auto Financial through an
instrument duly executed by such seller specifically stating that it is for use
in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement; PROVIDED however, that
the obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to this SECTION 7.6(b) shall
be several, and not joint and several, among such Indemnifying Parties on the
basis of the number of Registrable Securities included in such registration
statement and the aggregate amount which may be recovered from any holder of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the indemnification provided for in this
SECTION 7.6(B) in connection with any registration and sale of Registrable
Securities shall be limited to the total proceeds received by such holder from
the sale of such Registrable Securities. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of State
Auto Financial or any such director, officer or controlling Person and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such seller. Such holders shall also
indemnify each other Person who participates (including as an underwriter) in
the offering or sale of Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and
each other Person, if any, who controls any such participating Person within the
meaning of the Securities Act to the same extent as provided above with respect
to State Auto Financial.

                  (c) NOTICES OF CLAIMS, ETC. Promptly after receipt by an
Indemnified Party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
involving a claim referred to in the preceding paragraph (a) or (b) of this
SECTION 7.6, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against an Indemnifying Party pursuant to such paragraphs, give written
notice to the latter of the commencement of such action, PROVIDED that the
failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under the preceding paragraphs
of this SECTION 7.6, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is
brought against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in and, unless, in the reasonable judgment of any Indemnified
Party, a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and any
Indemnifying Party exists with respect to such claim, to assume



                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>

the defense thereof, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly
notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such
Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; PROVIDED that the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at the Indemnified Party's
expense; and PROVIDED further that the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties
shall have the right to employ one counsel to represent it or them if, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties, it is
advisable for it or them to be represented by separate counsel by reason of
having legal defenses which are different from or in addition to those available
to the Indemnifying Party, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of
such one counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it
will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for
the Indemnified Parties with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any Indemnified Party a conflict of interest may exist between such
Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Parties with respect to such claim,
in which event the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay the fees and
expenses of such additional counsel for the Indemnified Parties or counsels. No
Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement without the consent of the Indemnified Party. No Indemnifying Party
shall be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (d) CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnity and reimbursement
obligation provided for in any paragraph of this SECTION 7.6 is unavailable or
insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses (or
actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the
Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses (or actions or proceedings in
respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the
other hand in connection with statements or omissions which resulted in such
Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
untrue statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of
this paragraph. The amount paid by an Indemnified Party as a result of the
Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to
include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating or defending any Loss which is the
subject of this paragraph.

                  No Indemnified Party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.



                                     - 21 -
<PAGE>

                  (e) OTHER INDEMNIFICATION. Indemnification similar to that
specified in the preceding paragraphs of this SECTION 7.6 (with appropriate
modifications) shall be given by State Auto Financial and each seller of
Registrable Securities with respect to any required registration or other
qualification of securities under any federal or state law or regulation of any
governmental authority other than the Securities Act. The provisions of this
SECTION 7.6 shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or
contribution which an Indemnified Party may have pursuant to law, equity,
contract or otherwise.

                  (f) INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS. The indemnification required by
this SECTION 7.6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during
the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or
Losses are incurred.

         7.7 COVENANTS RELATING TO RULE 144. The Company will file reports in
compliance with the Exchange Act, will comply with all rules and regulations of
the Commission applicable in connection with the use of Rule 144 and take such
other actions and furnish such holder with such other information as such holder
may request in order to avail itself of such rule or any other rule or
regulation of the Commission allowing such holder to sell any Registrable
Securities without registration and will, at its expense, forthwith upon the
request of any holder of Registrable Securities, deliver to such holder a
certificate, signed by State Auto Financial's principal financial officer,
stating (a) State Auto Financial's name, address and telephone number (including
area code), (b) State Auto Financial's Internal Revenue Service identification
number, (c) State Auto Financial's Commission file number, (d) the number of
shares of each class of Stock outstanding as shown by the most recent report or
statement published by State Auto Financial, and (e) whether State Auto
Financial has filed the reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act for
a period of at least 90 days prior to the date of such certificate and in
addition has filed the most recent annual report required to be filed
thereunder.

         7.8 REFERENCES TO HOLDERS OF REGISTRABLE SECURITIES. For purposes of
this Agreement, references to holders of the Registrable Securities or holders
of a majority of the Registrable Securities shall be deemed to refer to the
pledgee of the Registered Securities under the Pledge and Security Agreement
dated as of even date herewith between the Company and the Agent (as modified
and supplemented and in effect from time to time, the "PLEDGE AGREEMENT") for so
long as the Pledge Agreement shall remain in effect.

         8.1 WAIVER. No failure on the part of the either party hereto to
exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to,
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies provided
herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

of this Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce its respective rights

in any jurisdiction, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) the other
provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction in

                                     PART A

                                 EQUITY RIGHTS


State Auto Financial has in place several stock option plans, all of which are
registered with the SEC. These plans are disclosed in the footnotes to the
financial statements of State Auto Financial filed with the SEC form 10K for
the year 2000. A copy of these Stock Option Plan footnotes is attached hereto
as Exhibit A.

               STATE AUTO FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
   (a majority-owned subsidiary of State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

(10) PREFERRED STOCK

     State Auto Financial has authorized two classes of preferred stock. For
both classes, upon issuance, the Board of Directors has authority to fix and
determine the significant features of the shares issued, including, among other
things, the dividend rate, redemption price, redemption rights, conversion
features and liquidation price payable in the event of any liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of State Auto Financial. See note 6
(a) regarding State Auto Financial's obligation to issue redeemable preferred
shares to SPC in connection with its catastrophic reinsurance arrangements with
a financial institution.

     The Class A preferred stock is not entitled to voting rights until, for
any period, dividends are in arrears in the amount of six or more quarterly
dividends.

(11) STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

     The Company follows Accounting Principles Board Option No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock incentive plans. For stock options granted to
employees of Mutual in 1999, the Company also followed APB 25 and related
interpretations, as the Company deemed such employees to be common law
employees of the Company. Compensation cost charged against operations in 2000
and 1999 were $31,000 and $137,000, respectively, for those employee stock
options granted where the exercise price was less than the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for the Company's
plans been determined based on the fair values at the grant dates consistent
with the method of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
SFAS No. 123), the Company's pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share
information would have been as follows:

                                                   2000       1999      1998
                                                   ----       ----      ----
                                                     (in thousands, except
                                                       per share figures)

Pro forma net earnings .......................... $45,784    41,414    35,700

Pro forma net earnings per common share
  Basic ......................................... $  1.19      1.02      0.85
  Diluted ....................................... $  1.17      1.00      0.83

The fair value of options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 were estimated at the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted
average fair values and related assumptions for options granted were as follows:

                                                   2000       1999      1998
                                                   ----       ----      ----

Fair value ...................................... $4.66      $4.49     $6.10
Dividend yield ..................................   .90%       .90%      .75%
Risk free interest rate .........................  6.51%      5.77%     5.31%
Expected volatility factor ......................   .34        .32       .31
Expected life (years) ...........................   7.2        5.7       6.6

     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,
in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

     The Company has stock option plans for certain directors and key
employees. The nonemployee directors' plan provides each nonemployee director
an option to purchase 1,500 shares of common stock following each annual
meeting of the shareholders at an option price equal to the fair market value
at the last business day prior to the annual meeting. The Company has reserved
300,000 shares of common stock under this plan. These options are exercisable
at issuance to 10 years from date of grant. The key employee's plan provides
that qualified stock options

<PAGE>

               STATE AUTO FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
   (a majority-owned subsidiary of State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

may be granted at an option price not less than fair market value at date of
grant and that nonqualified stock options may be granted at any price
determined by the options committee of the Board of Directors. The Company has
reserved 5,000,000 shares of common stock under this plan. These options are
exercisable at such time or times as may be determined by a committee of the
Company's Board of Directors. Normally, for certain employees these options are
exercisable from 1 to 10 years from date of grant and 3 to 10 years for
remaining employees.

     The Company has an employee stock purchase plan with a dividend
reinvestment feature, under which employees of the Company may choose at two
different specified time intervals each year to have up to 6% of their annual
base earnings withheld to purchase the Company's common stock. The purchase
price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its beginning-of-interval or end-of-
interval market price. The Company has reserved 2,400,000 shares of common
stock under this plan. At December 31, 2000, 1,699,000 shares have been
purchased under this plan.

     The Company has a stock option incentive plan for certain designated
independent insurance agencies that represent the Company and its affiliates.
The Company has reserved 400,000 shares of common stock under this plan. The
plan provides that the options become exercisable on the first day of the
calendar year following the agency's achievement of specific production and
profitability requirements over a period not greater than two calendar years
from date of grant or a portion thereof in the first calendar year in which an
agency commences participation under the plan. Options granted and vested under
this plan have a 10-year term. The Company has accounted for the plan in its
accompanying financial statements at fair value. The fair value of options
granted was estimated at the reporting date or vesting date using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted average fair value and related
assumptions for 2000 and 1999, respectively, were as follows: fair value of
$10.91 and $4.02; dividend yield of .90% for both years; expected volatility
factor of .32 and .30; risk-free interest rate of 5.19% and 6.80%; and expected
life of the option of 9.0 and 9.7 years. Expense of $493,000 and $105,000
associated with this plan was recognized in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information
for these plans for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, follows:

                                     PART B


During 2001, the common shares of STFC became a permitted investment in the
State Auto 401(k) Capital Accumulation Plan (the "CAP") plan and in
non-qualified deferred compensation plans for key employees and directors. The
CAP and Employee Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan were registered with
the SEC. The Directors' Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan was not
registered with the SEC, since it is within the scope of an exception to
registration. The participants in the non-qualified deferred compensation plans
are unsecured creditors of State Auto and part of the obligations under those
plans will reflect the value of STFC common shares to the extent any
participants investments are so directed. Fidelity Investments is the Trustee
of the CAP.

State Auto Financial has an active program of share repurchases ongoing as
authorized by its board of directors.

SAF Funding Corporation (the "COMPANY")

To Bank One, NA,
as Agent (the "AGENT") under, and
each of the Lenders party to, the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
as of November 16, 2001, among the
Company, the Agent and such Lenders

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         I am the general counsel of State Auto Financial Corporation ("STATE
AUTO FINANCIAL") and have acted as counsel to State Auto Financial in connection
with the Amended and Restated Standby Purchase Agreement dated as of November
16, 2001 (the "STANDBY PURCHASE AGREEMENT") between State Auto Financial and the
Company, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to purchase, from time to
time, a certain number of shares of State Auto Financial's Class A Redeemable
Preferred Stock, no par value per share (the "CLASS A PREFERRED Stock"). This
opinion letter is delivered to you pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Standby
Purchase Agreement in connection with the proposed issuance and sale by State
Auto Financial, and the purchase by the Company, on the date hereof, of ____
shares of the Class A Preferred Stock (the "PURCHASED STOCK").

         In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have examined the
following agreements, instruments and other documents:

         (a)  the Standby Purchase Agreement;

         (b)  certificates evidencing the Purchased Stock (the "PURCHASED STOCK
              CERTIFICATES"); and

         (c)  such records of State Auto Financial and such other documents as
              I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed
              below.

         In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures,
the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the
conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as
copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, I have relied
upon certificates of governmental officials and appropriate representatives of
State Auto Financial and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Standby
Purchase Agreement.


<PAGE>

         Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the
comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such
questions of law as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below, I am of the opinion that:

                  1. State Auto Financial is a corporation duly organized,
         validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
         Ohio.

                  2. State Auto Financial has all requisite corporate power and
         authority to issue and sell the Purchased Stock and execute and deliver
         the Purchased Stock Certificates.

                  3. The issuance and sale of the Purchased Stock to the Company
         and execution and delivery by State Auto Financial of the Purchased
         Stock Certificates have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
         action on the part of State Auto Financial.

                  4. The Purchased Stock Certificates have been duly executed
         and delivered by State Auto Financial.

                  5. No authorization, approval or consent of, and no filing or
         registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency
         of the United States of America or the State of Ohio (other than any
         authorizations, approvals, consents, filings and registrations
         heretofore duly made or obtained and in full force and effect) is
         required on the part of State Auto Financial for issuance and sale of
         the Purchased Stock to the Company and the execution and delivery of
         the Purchased Stock Certificates.

                  6. The issuance and sale of the Purchased Stock to the Company
         and the execution and delivery of the Purchased Stock do not and will
         not (a) violate any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Code
         of Regulations of State Auto Financial, (b) violate any applicable law,
         rule or regulation of the United States of America or the State of
         Ohio, (c) violate any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
         governmental authority or agency or any arbitral award applicable to
         State Auto Financial of which I have knowledge (after due inquiry) or
         (d) result in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any
         consent under, or result in the acceleration or required prepayment of
         any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or instrument
         of which I have knowledge (after due inquiry) to which such State Auto
         Financial or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
         is bound or to which any of them is subject, or result in the creation
         or imposition of any Lien upon any Property of State Auto Financial or
         any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or
         instrument.

                  7. The Purchased Shares are validly issued and outstanding,
         are fully paid and non-assessable and have, and entitle the holders
         thereof to, the relative rights and preferences set forth with respect
         to the Class A Preferred Stock in the Purchased Stock Certificates.

                  8. I have no knowledge (after due inquiry) of any legal or
         arbitral proceedings, or any proceedings by or before any governmental
         or regulatory authority or


<PAGE>

         agency, now pending or threatened against or affecting State Auto
         Financial or any of its Property that, if adversely determined, could
         have a Material Adverse Effect (excluding any Material Adverse Effect
         resulting from the catastrophic loss claims and/or loss adjustment
         expenses to which the issuance of the Purchased Stock relates).

         The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal
laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Ohio, and I do
not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. The opinions
contained in this letter are rendered only as of the date hereof and I undertake

me in my capacity as counsel to State Auto Financial, and this opinion letter
may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Basic Documents without, in each
