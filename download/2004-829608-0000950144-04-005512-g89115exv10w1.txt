                                CREDIT AGREEMENT

         This CREDIT AGREEMENT is entered into as of January 6, 2004 among
PSYCHIATRIC SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the
Guarantors (defined herein), the Lenders (defined herein) and BANK OF AMERICA,
N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer.

         The Borrower has requested that the Lenders provide a revolving credit
facility of up to $50 million for the purposes set forth herein and the Lenders
are willing to do so on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                        DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING TERMS

1.01     DEFINED TERMS.

         As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
set forth below:

         "Acquisition", by any Person, means the acquisition by such Person, in
a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, of all or any
substantial portion of the Property of another Person or at least a majority of
the Voting Stock of another Person, in each case whether or not involving a
merger or consolidation with such other Person and whether for cash, property,
services, assumption of Indebtedness, securities or otherwise.

         "Administrative Agent" means Bank of America in its capacity as
administrative agent under any of the Loan Documents, or any successor
administrative agent.

         "Administrative Agent's Office" means the Administrative Agent's
address and, as appropriate, account as set forth on Schedule 11.02 or such
other address or account as the Administrative Agent may from time to time
notify the Borrower and the Lenders.

         "Administrative Questionnaire" means an Administrative Questionnaire in
a form supplied by the Administrative Agent.

         "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, another Person that
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is
Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified. "Control"
means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause
the direction of the management or policies of a Person, whether through the
ability to exercise voting power, by contract or otherwise. "Controlling" and
"Controlled" have meanings correlative thereto. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, a Person shall be deemed to be Controlled by another Person if

the securities having ordinary voting power for the election of directors,
managing general partners or the equivalent.

         "Agent-Related Persons" means the Administrative Agent, together with
its Affiliates (including, in the case of Bank of America in its capacity as the
Administrative Agent, the Arranger), and the officers, directors, employees,
agents and attorneys-in-fact of such Persons and Affiliates.

         "Aggregate Revolving Commitments" means the Revolving Commitments of
all the Lenders. The amount of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments in effect on

                           (iv)     The term "documents" includes any and all
                  instruments, documents, agreements, certificates, notices,
                  reports, financial statements and other writings, however
                  evidenced, whether in physical or electronic form.

                  (c)      In the computation of periods of time from a
         specified date to a later specified date, the word "from" means "from
         and including;" the words "to" and "until" each mean "to but
         excluding;" and the word "through" means "to and including."

                  (d)      Section headings herein and in the other Loan
         Documents are included for convenience of reference only and shall not
         affect the interpretation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

1.03     ACCOUNTING TERMS.

         (a)      Except as otherwise specifically prescribed herein, all
accounting terms not specifically or completely defined herein shall be
construed in conformity with, and all financial data (including financial ratios
and other financial calculations) required to be submitted pursuant to this
Agreement shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP applied on a consistent
basis, as in effect from time to time, applied in a manner consistent with that
used in preparing the most recent Audited Financial Statements; provided,
however, that calculations of Attributable Indebtedness under any Synthetic
Lease or the implied interest component of any Synthetic Lease shall be made by
the Borrower in accordance with accepted financial practice and consistent with
the terms of such Synthetic Lease.

         (b)      Together with each Compliance Certificate, the Borrower will
provide a written summary of any changes in GAAP that materially impact the
calculation of the financial covenants in Section 8.11 contained in such
Compliance Certificate. If at any time any change in GAAP would affect the
computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan
Document, and either the Borrower or the Required Lenders shall so request, the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith
to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in
light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders);
provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall continue to
be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the
Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial
statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably
requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such
ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the above, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that all calculations of the financial covenants in Section 8.11
(including for purposes of determining compliance with such financial covenants
and determining the Applicable Rate) shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis.

                                       25

1.04     ROUNDING.

         Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant
to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by
the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of
places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or
down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).

1.05     REFERENCES TO AGREEMENTS AND LAWS.

         Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (a) references to
Organization Documents, agreements (including the Loan Documents) and other

by such Letter of Credit or the Letter of Credit Application therefor, whether
or not such maximum face amount is in effect at such time.

                                   ARTICLE II

                      THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS

2.01     REVOLVING LOANS.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender
severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Revolving Loan") to the
Borrower in Dollars from time to time on any Business Day during the
Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
the amount of such Lender's Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that after
giving effect to any Borrowing of Revolving Loans, (i) the Total Revolving
Outstandings shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments and (B) the Borrowing Base, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding
Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the
lesser of (A) such Lender's Revolving Commitment and (B) an amount equal to such
Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing Base. Within the
limits of each Lender's Revolving Commitment, and subject to the other terms and
conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under
Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Revolving Loans may be Base
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein, provided,
however, all Borrowings made on the Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate
Loans.

                                       26

<PAGE>

         (b)      The Borrower may at any time and from time to time, upon prior
written notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, increase the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments by up to THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ($30,000,000)
with additional Revolving Commitments from any existing Lender or new Revolving
Commitments from any other Person selected by the Borrower and approved by the
Administrative Agent; provided that:

                  (i)      any such increase shall be in a minimum principal
         amount of $5 million and in integral multiples of $5 million in excess
         thereof;

                  (ii)     no Default shall be continuing at the time of any
         such increase;

                  (iii)    no existing Lender shall be under any obligation to
         increase its Revolving Commitment and any such decision whether to
         increase its Revolving Commitment shall be in such Lender's sole and
         absolute discretion; and

                  (iv)     any new Lender shall join this Agreement by executing
         such joinder documents reasonably required by the Administrative Agent.

         In connection with any such increase in the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments, Schedule 2.01 shall be revised by the Administrative Agent
         to reflect the new Revolving Commitments and distributed to the
         Lenders.

2.02     BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF LOANS.

         (a)      Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the
other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the
Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by
telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not
later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any
Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any
conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) on the
requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each telephonic notice by
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) must be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of
or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a
whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether
telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a
Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation
of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion
or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the
principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type
of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (v)
if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the
Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower
fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the
applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such
automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of
the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar
Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to
specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest
Period of one month.

         (b)      Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the
applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a

                                       27

<PAGE>


conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each
Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent
in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's Office not later
than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (and, if
such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 5.01), the
Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower
in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting
the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of
such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with
instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent
by the Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date a Borrowing of
Revolving Loans, there are Swing Line Loans or L/C Borrowings outstanding, then
the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full
of any such L/C Borrowings, second, to the payment in full of any such Swing
Line Loans, and third, to the Borrower as provided above.

         (c)      Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan
may be continued or converted only on the last day of the Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be
requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or
all of the then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be converted immediately to
Base Rate Loans.

         (d)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The
determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans
are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the
Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

         (e)      After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of
Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same
Type, there shall not be more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect with
respect to Revolving Loans.

2.03     LETTERS OF CREDIT.

         (a)      The Letter of Credit Commitment.

                  (i)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
         (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other
         Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any
         Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter
         of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit in Dollars for
         the account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and to amend or
         renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with
         subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drafts under the Letters of
         Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters
         of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries; provided that the L/C Issuer shall not be obligated to
         make any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, and
         no Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit if,
         after giving effect to such L/C Credit Extension, (x) the Total
         Revolving Outstandings would exceed the lesser of the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments and the Borrowing Base, (y) the aggregate
         Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such
         Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C
         Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding
         Amount of all Swing Line Loans would exceed the lesser of such Lender's
         Revolving Commitment and an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving

                                       28

<PAGE>
         Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing Base, or (z) the Outstanding
         Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the Letter of Credit
         Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and
         conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of Credit
         shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the
         foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit
         that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.

                  (ii)     The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue
         any Letter of Credit if:

                           (A)      any order, judgment or decree of any
                  Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms
                  purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such
                  Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or
                  any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
                  law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
                  the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer
                  refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or
                  such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the
                  L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any
                  restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C
                  Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect
                  on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any
                  unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on
                  the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems
                  material to it;

                           (B)      subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry
                  date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than
                  twelve months after the date of issuance or last renewal,
                  unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                           (C)      the expiry date of such requested Letter of
                  Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date,
                  unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date;

                           (D)      the issuance of such Letter of Credit would
                  violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer; or

                           (E)      such Letter of Credit is in an initial
                  amount less than $100,000 or is to be denominated in a
                  currency other than Dollars.

                  (iii)    The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend
         any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at
         such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the
         terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not
         accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

                  (iv)     The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue
         or amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer has received written
         notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, on
         or prior to the Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or
         amendment of such Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable
         conditions contained in Article V shall not then be satisfied.

         (b)      Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;
Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.

                  (i)      Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as
         the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
         Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a
         Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a
         Responsible

                                       29

<PAGE>

         Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be
         received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than
         11:00 a.m. at least three Business Days (or such later date and time as
         the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole
         discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment,
         as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of
         a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in
         form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed
         issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a
         Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D)
         the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to
         be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F)
         the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in
         case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C
         Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an
         amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
         Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C
         Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of
         amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of
         the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer
         may reasonably require.

                  (ii)     Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
         Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent
         (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received
         a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if
         not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
         thereof. Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the
         Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is
         permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the
         terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested
         date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter
         into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in
         accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business
         practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
         Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such
         Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro
         Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

                  (iii)    If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter
         of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer shall issue a Letter of Credit
         that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an "Auto-Renewal Letter of
         Credit"); provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must
         permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each
         twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such
         Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not
         later than a day (the "Nonrenewal Notice Date") in each such
         twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit
         is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower
         shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for
         any such renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been
         issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not
         require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit
         at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit
         Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not
         permit any such renewal if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it
         would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in
         its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of
         Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which
         may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five
         (5) Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the
         Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to
         permit such renewal or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
         the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
         Section 5.02 is not then satisfied.

                  (iv)     Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit
         or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
         thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver
         to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy
         of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

         (c)      Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                  (i)      Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of
         Credit of any notice of drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C
         Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.
         Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer
         under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the
         Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative
         Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower
         fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative
         Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount
         of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount
         of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the Borrower
         shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be
         disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed
         Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
         Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject
         to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than
         the delivery of a Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or
         the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be
         given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that
         the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the
         conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

                  (ii)     Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C
         Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds
         available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
         at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata
         Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
         Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
         whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each
         Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a
         Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent
         shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.

                  (iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not
         fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the
         conditions set forth in Section 5.02 cannot be satisfied or for any
         other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the
         L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount
         that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable
         on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the
         Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
         Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its
         participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance
         from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under
         this Section 2.03.

                  (iv)     Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C
         Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer
         for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of
         such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the
         account of the L/C Issuer.

                  (v)      Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or
         L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under
         Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this

                                       31

<PAGE>

         Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
         affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim,
         recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against
         the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
         whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any
         other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of
         the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make
         Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the
         conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than delivery by the
         Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall
         relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
         the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer
         under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

                  (vi)     If any Lender fails to make available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount
         required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions
         of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii),
         the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting
         through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the
         date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer
         at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time
         in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender
         (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing
         under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                  (i)      At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment
         under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such
         Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
         Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account
         of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed
         Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or
         otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
         Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such
         Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case
         of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
         Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those
         received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (ii)     If any payment received by the Administrative Agent
         for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is
         required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
         Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
         L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata
         Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest
         thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
         returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect.

         (e)      Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to
repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter
         of Credit, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
         agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                  (ii)     the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off,
         defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against
         any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit

                                       32

<PAGE>

         (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may
         be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection
         with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
         Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or
         any unrelated transaction;

                  (iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document
         presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
         transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
         drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                  (iv)     any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of
         Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
         strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment
         made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person
         purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
         assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
         representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of
         such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any
         proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                  (v)      any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
         circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
         a discharge of, the Borrower.

         The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the
Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

         (f)      Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that,
in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have
any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft,
certificates and documents expressly required by such Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the
L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person or any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with
the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any
action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or
Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to,
and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it
may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the
respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be
liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer,
and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the
extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages
suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C
Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face
to be in

                                       33

<PAGE>

order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove
to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

         (g)      Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
(i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if,
as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any
reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall
immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the
date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case
may be). For purposes hereof, "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit
with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer
and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account
balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to
by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The
Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts
and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash collateral
shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of
America.

         (h)      Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by
the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of
the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of
International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in
effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit.

         (i)      Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the
Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under
such Letter of Credit). Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a
quarterly basis in arrears. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable
on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and
December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of
such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on
demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the
daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied
by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such
Applicable Rate was in effect.

         (j)      Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The
Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee
with respect to each Letter of Credit in the amounts and at the times specified
in the Fee Letter. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and
other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer
relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary
fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are
nonrefundable.

         (k)      Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of
any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

                                       34

2.04     SWING LINE LOANS.

         (a)      The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Swing
Line Loan") to the Borrower in Dollars from time to time on any Business Day
during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that
such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the
Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations of the Swing Line
Lender in its capacity as a Lender of Revolving Loans, may exceed the amount of
such Lender's Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect
to any Borrowing of Swing Line Loans, (i) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall
not exceed the lesser of (A) the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and (B) the
Borrowing Base, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans
of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of
all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount
of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the lesser of (A) such Lender's
Revolving Commitment and (B) an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving
Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing Base, and provided, further, that the
Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any
outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the
other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section
2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each
Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a
Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk
participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such
Lender's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.

         (b)      Borrowing Procedures. Each Borrowing of Swing Line Loans shall
be made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than
1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to
be borrowed, which shall be a minimum principal amount of $100,000, or a whole
multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the requested borrowing date,
which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed
promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a
written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a
Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line
Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not,
the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received
notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at
the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed
Borrowing of Swing Line Loans (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make
such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the proviso to
the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable
conditions specified in Article V is not then satisfied, then, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00
p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the
amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower.

         (c)      Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.

                  (i)      The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and
         absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which
         hereby irrevocably requests and authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so
         request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an
         amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing
         Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing
         (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice

                                       35

<PAGE>

         for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section
         2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for
         the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized
         portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set
         forth in Section 5.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower
         with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering
         such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an
         amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such Loan
         Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
         funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative
         Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such
         Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender
         that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate
         Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall
         remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.

                  (ii)     If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be
         refinanced by such a Borrowing of Revolving Loans in accordance with
         Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the
         Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request
         by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk
         participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender's payment
         to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender
         pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of
         such participation.

                  (iii)    If any Lender fails to make available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any
         amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section
         2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from
         such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such
         amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment
         is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
         to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line
         Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with
         respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be
         conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (iv)     Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or
         to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant
         to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
         not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off,
         counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may
         have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person
         for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a
         Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each
         Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section
         2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02. No such
         purchase or funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise
         impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans,
         together with interest as provided herein.

         (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                  (i)      At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded
         a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender
         receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line
         Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such
         payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to
         reflect the period of time during which such Lender's risk
         participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the
         Swing Line Lender.

                  (ii)     If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in
         respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to
         be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any

                                       36

<PAGE>

         of the circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to
         any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its
         discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro
         Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest
         thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
         returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The
         Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the
         Swing Line Lender.

         (e)      Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line
Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing
Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans
or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata
Share shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

         (f)      Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall
make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans
directly to the Swing Line Lender.

2.05     PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)      Voluntary Prepayments of Loans.

                  (i)      Revolving Loans. The Borrower may, upon notice from
         the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to
         time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in whole or in part without
         premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by
         the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business
         Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (B)
         on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any such prepayment
         of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000
         or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the
         entire principal amount thereof then outstanding); (iii) any such
         prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
         $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if
         less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding). Each such
         notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the
         Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly
         notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the
         amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such
         notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such
         prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due
         and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a
         Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest
         thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
         Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the
         Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

                  (ii)     Swing Line Loans. The Borrower may, upon notice to
         the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any
         time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole
         or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice
         must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent
         not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (ii) any
         such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 or a
         whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire
         principal amount thereof then outstanding). Each such notice shall
         specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given
         by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the
         payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the
         date specified therein.

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments of Loans.

                                       37

<PAGE>

                  (i)      Total Revolving Outstandings. If for any reason the
         Total Revolving Outstandings at any time exceed the lesser of the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the Borrowing Base, the Borrower
         shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans and/or the Swing Line Loans in
         an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

                  (ii)     Dispositions and Involuntary Dispositions. The
         Borrower shall prepay the Loans as hereafter provided in an aggregate
         amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Disposition or
         Involuntary Disposition (each such prepayment to be applied as set
         forth in clause (v) below) to the extent (A) such Net Cash Proceeds are
         not reinvested in Property useful in the business of the Borrower and
         its Subsidiaries within nine (9) months of the date of such Disposition
         or Involuntary Disposition, and (B) the aggregate amount of Net Cash
         Proceeds of all Dispositions and Involuntary Dispositions not
         reinvested in accordance with the foregoing clause (A) shall exceed
         $2,000,000 in any fiscal year of the Borrower.

                  (iii)    Debt Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by the
         Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Debt
         Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans as hereafter provided in
         an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds (such
         prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (v) below).

                  (iv)     Equity Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by the
         Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Equity
         Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans as hereafter provided in
         an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds (such
         prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (v) below).

                  (v)      Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All amounts
         required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied
         first to Swing Line Loans and then (after all Swing Line Loans have
         been repaid) to Revolving Loans. Within the parameters of the
         applications set forth above, prepayments shall be applied first to
         Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Rate Loans in direct order of
         Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.05(b)
         shall be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or
         penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount
         prepaid through the date of prepayment.

2.06     TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF AGGREGATE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS.

         The Borrower may, upon notice from the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent, terminate the Aggregate Revolving Commitments or from time to time
permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments to an amount not less
than the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C
Obligations; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the
date of termination or reduction and (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in
an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such
notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments. Any
reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the
Revolving Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All
commitment fees and utilization fees accrued until the effective date of any
termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be paid on the
effective date of such termination.

                                       38

2.07     REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

         (a)      The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date
the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.

         (b)      The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier
to occur of (i) demand by the Swing Line Lender and (ii) the Maturity Date.

2.08     INTEREST.

         (a)      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Revolving Loan that is a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per
annum equal to the sum of (A) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus
(B) the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Revolving Loan that is a Base Rate Loan bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
borrowing or conversion date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

         (b)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all
outstanding Obligations at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times
equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

         (c)      Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

2.09     FEES.

         In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j) of
Section 2.03:

                  (a)      Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with
         its Pro Rata Share, a commitment fee equal to the product of (i) the
         Applicable Rate times (ii) the actual daily amount by which the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceed the sum of (y) the Outstanding
         Amount of Revolving Loans and (z) the Outstanding Amount of L/C
         Obligations. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the
         Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of
         the conditions in Article V is not met, and shall be due and payable
         quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
         September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur
         after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The commitment fee
         shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in
         the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall
         be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each
         period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. For
         purposes of clarification, Swing Line Loans shall not be considered
         outstanding for purposes of determining the unused portion of the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments.

                  (b)      Utilization Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with
         its Pro Rata Share, a utilization fee of (i) 0.25% per annum times (ii)
         the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Revolving Commitments
         exceed the sum of (y) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (z)
         the Outstanding

                                       39

<PAGE>
         Amount of L/C Obligations, on each day that the Total Outstandings are
         less than 33% of the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Revolving
         Commitments. The utilization fee shall accrue at all times during the
         Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of
         the conditions in Article V is not met, and shall be due and payable
         quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
         September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur
         after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The utilization fee
         shall be calculated quarterly in arrears. For purposes of
         clarification, Swing Line Loans shall be considered outstanding for
         purposes of determining the utilization fee.

                  (c)      Other Fees.

                           (i)      The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and
                  the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts
                  fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee
                  Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall be
                  non-refundable for any reason whatsoever.

                           (ii)     The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such
                  fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in
                  the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be
                  fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any
                  reason whatsoever.

2.10     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

         All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is
determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a
year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other
computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year
and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable,
being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue
on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion
is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is
made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day.

2.11     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         (a)      The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced
by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a promissory note,
which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or
records. Each such promissory note shall (i) in the case of Revolving Loans, be
in the form of Exhibit C-1 (a "Revolving Note"), and (ii) in the case of Swing
Line Loans, be in the form of Exhibit C-2 (a "Swing Line Note"). Each Lender may
attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable),
amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

                                       40

<PAGE>

         (b)      In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases
and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line
Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained
by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in
respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent
shall control in the absence of manifest error.

2.12     PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

         (a)      All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on
the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of
such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending
Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

         (b)      Subject to the definition of "Interest Period", if any payment
to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

         (c)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C
Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, toward costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) incurred by the Administrative Agent, (ii) second,
toward costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under
Article III) incurred by the Lenders, ratably among the parties entitled thereto
in accordance with the amounts of costs and expenses then due to such parties,
(iii) third, toward repayment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest
and fees then due to such parties, and (iv) fourth, toward repayment of
principal and L/C Borrowings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C Borrowings
then due to such parties.

         (d)      Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it
to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such
payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make
available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds, then:

                  (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
         Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
         portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender
         in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
         respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made
         available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such
         amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
         funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                                       41

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
         Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
         amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by
         the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the
         applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
         upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
         Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower
         shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with
         interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
         to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing
         herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
         fulfill its Revolving Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the
         Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
         result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (d) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

         (e)      If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent
funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such
funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without
interest.

         (f)      The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to
fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and
not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such
participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender
of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase
its participation.

         (g)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

2.13     SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall
obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C
Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it (but not including any amounts
applied by the Swing Line Lender to outstanding Swing Line Loans), any payment
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off,
or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated
hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative
Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations
in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in
L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall
be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in
respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with
each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the
circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to
that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such
paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the

                                       42

<PAGE>

amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered,
without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off, but subject to Section 11.09) with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall
be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations
purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following
any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation
pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to
give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under
this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the
same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the
Obligations purchased.

                                   ARTICLE III

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

3.01     TAXES.

         (a)      Subject to Section 11.15, any and all payments by any Loan
Party to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any
Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and
all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments,
fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding, in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes
imposed on or measured by its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on
it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political
subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a lending office (all such
non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If any Loan Party shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), each of the
Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall
make such deductions, (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable Laws, and (iv) within thirty days after the date of such payment,
such Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward
the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof or if no receipt is available, other evidence of
payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c)      If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes
or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time

                                       43

<PAGE>

interest is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such
Lender specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring
in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been deducted or paid.

         (d)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii)
amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including
additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
Payment under this subsection (d) shall be made within thirty days after the
date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

         (e)      If any Loan Party is required to pay any amount to any Lender
or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.01, then such Lender
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions)
to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such
additional payment which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

3.02     ILLEGALITY.

         If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent,
any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to
convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such
Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate
Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

3.03     INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES.

         If the Administrative Agent determines that for any reason adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or
that the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to
a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost
to the Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders
to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have
converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the
amount specified therein.

3.04     INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         (a)      If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's
compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as
the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction
in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of
the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased
costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of
which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii) reserve
requirements utilized, as to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in the determination of the
Eurodollar Rate), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction.

         (b)      If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's
obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to
time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

3.05     FUNDING LOSSES.

         Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and
hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a
result of:

                  (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment
         of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,
         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than
         the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue
         or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the
         amount notified by the Borrower; or

                  (c)      any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day
         other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of
         (i) a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.16 or (ii) an
         assignment by Bank of America pursuant to Section 11.07(b) as part of
         the primary syndication of the Commitments and Loans during the 180-day
         period immediately following the Closing Date;

         including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense
         arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to
         maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from
         which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any
         customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with
         the foregoing.

                                       45

<PAGE>

         For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the
Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each
Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining
the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in
the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a
comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so
funded.

3.06     MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION.

         (a)      A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such
Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

         (b)      Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under
Section 3.01 or 3.04, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 11.16.

3.07     SURVIVAL.

         All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article III shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and repayment of all
Obligations.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    GUARANTY

4.01     THE GUARANTY.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Swap Contract or Treasury
Management Agreement, and the Administrative Agent as hereinafter provided, as
primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Obligations in full
when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by
acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in
accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if
any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally,
promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the
case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations,
the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity,
as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension
or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Loan Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management
Agreements, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest
amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under the
Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.

4.02     OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.01 are joint and
several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents, Swap
Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, or any other agreement or
instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release, impairment or
exchange of any other guarantee of or security

                                       46

<PAGE>

for any of the Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor,
it being the intent of this Section 4.02 that the obligations of the Guarantors
hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances.
Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation,
indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or any other
Guarantor for amounts paid under this Article IV until such time as the
Obligations have been paid in full and the Aggregate Revolving Commitments have
expired or terminated. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one
or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any
Guarantor hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described
above:

                  (a)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance
         shall be waived;

                  (b)      any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         any of the Loan Documents, any Swap Contract or Treasury Management
         Agreement between any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a
         Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan
         Documents or such Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements
         shall be done or omitted;

                  (c)      the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be
         accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented
         or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Loan
         Documents, any Swap Contract or Treasury Management Agreement between
         any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any
         other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents or such
         Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements shall be waived or any
         other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor
         shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or
         otherwise dealt with;

                  (d)      any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of
         the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

                  (e)      any of the Obligations shall be determined to be void
         or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any
         creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of
         any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any
         Guarantor).

         With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby
expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all
notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under
any of the Loan Documents, any Swap Contract or Treasury Management Agreement
between any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any
other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents or such Swap
Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, or against any other Person under
any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations.

4.03     REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article IV shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result
of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each
Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender
on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or
such

                                       47

<PAGE>

Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging
that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar
payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

4.04     CERTAIN ADDITIONAL WAIVERS.

         Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of
recourse to security for the Obligations, except through the exercise of rights
of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.02 and through the exercise of rights of
contribution pursuant to Section 4.06.

4.05     REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due
and payable as provided in Section 9.02 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section
9.02) for purposes of Section 4.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Obligations from
becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in
the event of such declaration (or the Obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), the Obligations (whether or not due and payable
by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors
for purposes of Section 4.01. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their
obligations hereunder are secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral
Documents and that the Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in
accordance with the terms thereof.

4.06     RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments
made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other
Guarantors as permitted under applicable law. Such contribution rights shall be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the obligations of such
Guarantors under the Loan Documents and no Guarantor shall exercise such rights
of contribution until all Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments
have terminated.

4.07     GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The guarantee in this Article IV is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations
whenever arising.

                                    ARTICLE V

         Agent, the Borrower shall have paid all Attorney Costs of the
         Administrative Agent to the extent invoiced prior to or on the Closing
         Date, plus such additional amounts of Attorney Costs as shall
         constitute its reasonable estimate of Attorney Costs incurred or to be
         incurred by it through the closing proceedings (provided that such
         estimate shall not thereafter preclude a final settling of accounts
         between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent).

7.14     PLEDGED ASSETS.

         Subject to Section 7.15, (a) cause all of the owned and leased Property
(other than Excluded Property) of each Loan Party to be subject at all times to
first priority, perfected Liens and, in the case of owned and leased real
property, title insured Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent to secure the
Obligations pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents or,
with respect to any such Property acquired subsequent to the Closing Date, such
other additional security documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
request, subject in any case to Permitted Liens and (b) deliver such other
documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing, including, without limitation, appropriate UCC-1 financing
statements, real estate title insurance policies, surveys, environmental
reports, landlord's waivers, certified resolutions and other organizational and
authorizing documents of such Person, favorable opinions of counsel to such
Person (which shall cover, among other things, the legality, validity, binding
effect and enforceability of the documentation referred to above and the
perfection of the Administrative Agent's Liens thereunder) and other items of
the types required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(d), all in form,
content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         Without limiting the generality of the above, the Loan Parties will
cause (a) 100% of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of each Domestic
Subsidiary and (b) 65% (or such greater percentage that, due to a change in an
applicable Law after the date hereof, (1) could not reasonably be expected to
cause the undistributed earnings of such Foreign Subsidiary as determined for
United States federal income tax purposes to be treated as a deemed dividend to
such Foreign Subsidiary's United States parent and (2) could not reasonably be
expected to cause any material adverse tax consequences) of the issued and
outstanding Capital Stock entitled to vote (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
Section 1.956-2(c)(2)) and 100% of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock not
entitled to vote (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.956-2(c)(2)) in
each Foreign Subsidiary directly owned by the Borrower or any Domestic
Subsidiary to be subject at all times to a first priority, perfected Lien in
favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Collateral Documents or such other security documents as the Administrative
Agent shall reasonably request.

         With respect to each Account for which either the perfection,
enforceability, or validity of the Administrative Agent's Liens in such Account,
or the Administrative Agent's right or ability to obtain direct payment to the
Administrative Agent of the proceeds of such Account, is governed by any
federal, state, or local statutory requirements other than those of the Uniform
Commercial Code, the Loan Parties will take such steps as the Administrative
Agent may from time to time reasonably request, including, without limitation,
compliance with the Federal Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, as amended, the
Social Security Act, the Medicare Regulations and the Medicaid Regulations.

7.15     POST-CLOSING MATTERS.

         (a)      Interest Rate Protection Agreement(s). Within sixty (60) days
of the Closing Date the Borrower shall enter into interest rate protection
agreements (protecting against fluctuations in interest rates) reasonably

duration reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

10.01    APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a)      Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

         (b)      The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to
the Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for
letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X and in the definition of
"Agent-Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C
Issuer.

10.02    DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other
consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

                                       79

10.03    LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties
expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender
or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by
any Loan Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan
Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party
to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or
any Affiliate thereof.

10.04    RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a)      The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan
Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or
consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be
expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken
or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

         (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 5.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
specifying its objection thereto.

10.05    NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default." The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its
receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance
with Article IX; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative
Agent has received any such direction, the

                                       80

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

10.06    CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person
to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have
disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrower and the other Loan Parties hereunder. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan
Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to
be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any
of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into
the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

10.07    INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the
obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each
Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the
payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be
deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this
Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative
Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The
undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments, the payment of all Obligations and the resignation of the
Administrative Agent.

                                       81

10.08    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates
as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent
shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect
to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though
it were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms "Lender"
and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

10.09    SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty
days' notice to the Lenders; provided that any such resignation by Bank of
America shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swing Line
Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required
Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent
for the Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by
the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default
(which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of
the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor
administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as
such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender
and the respective terms "Administrative Agent", "L/C Issuer" and "Swing Line
Lender" shall mean such successor administrative agent, Letter of Credit issuer
and swing line lender, and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment,
powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated and the retiring
L/C Issuer's and Swing Line Lender's rights, powers and duties as such shall be
terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender or any other Lender, other than the
obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to issue letters of credit in
substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such
succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer
to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to
such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X and Sections
11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no
successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent
by the date thirty days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

10.10    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then
be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the

                                       82

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

                  (a)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C
         Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to
         file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
         have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including
         any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
         advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
         respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and
         the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and
         11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

                  (b)      to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 11.04.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

10.11    COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS.

         The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its
         option and in its discretion,

                  (a)      to release any Lien on any Collateral granted to or
         held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon
         termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and payment in full
         of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations)
         and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that
         is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with
         any Disposition permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
         any Involuntary Disposition, or (iii) as approved in accordance with
         Section 11.01; and

                  (b)      to release any Guarantor from its obligations under
         the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a
         transaction permitted hereunder.

         Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required
         Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to
         release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of
         Property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the
         Guaranty, pursuant to this Section 10.11.

10.12    OTHER AGENTS; ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS.

         None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or
signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent," "documentation
agent," "co-agent," "book manager," "lead

                                       83

<PAGE>

manager," "arranger," "lead arranger" or "co-arranger" shall have any right,
power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other
than, in the case of such Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so
identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on
any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this
Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

11.01    AMENDMENTS, ETC.

         No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan
Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required
Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, and
acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

                  (a)      extend or increase the Revolving Commitment of any
         Lender (or reinstate any Revolving Commitment terminated pursuant to
         Section 9.02) without the written consent of such Lender (it being
         understood and agreed that a waiver of any condition precedent set
         forth in Section 5.02 or of any Default or Event of Default or a
         mandatory reduction in Revolving Commitments is not considered an
         extension or increase in Revolving Commitments of any Lender);

                  (b)      postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any
         other Loan Document for any payment of principal (excluding mandatory
         prepayments), interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or
         any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the
         written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

                  (c)      reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest
         specified herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or any fees or other
         amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the
         written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided,
         however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be
         necessary to amend the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any
         obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate;

                  (d)      change Section 2.13 or Section 9.03 in a manner that
         would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without
         the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

                  (e)      change any provision of this Section or the
         definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof
         specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive
         or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or
         grant any consent hereunder without the written consent of each Lender
         directly affected thereby;

                  (f)      except in connection with a Disposition permitted
         under Section 8.05, release all or substantially all of the Collateral
         without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
         or

                                       84

<PAGE>

                  (g)      release the Borrower or, except in connection with a
         merger or consolidation permitted under Section 8.04 or a Disposition
         permitted under Section 8.05, all or substantially all of the
         Guarantors, from its or their obligations under the Loan Documents
         without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Letter
of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by
it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; (iii) no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document; and (iv) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges
thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder,
except that the Revolving Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or
extended without the consent of such Lender.

Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is required in
certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is entitled to vote as
such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects the
Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein
and (y) the Required Lenders shall determine whether or not to allow a Loan
Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding and such determination shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

11.02    NOTICES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS; FACSIMILE COPIES.

         (a)      General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including by facsimile transmission). All such written notices shall be mailed,
faxed or delivered to the applicable address, facsimile number or (subject to
subsection (c) below) electronic mail address, and all notices and other
communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be
made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:

                  (i)      if to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the L/C
         Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, to the address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number specified for such Person
         on Schedule 11.02 or to such other address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be designated by
         such party in a notice to the other parties; and

                  (ii)     if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
         Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be
         designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender.

         All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given
or made upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant party
hereto and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on
behalf of the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business
Days after deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile,

                                       85

<PAGE>

provisions of subsection (c) below), when delivered; provided, however, that
notices and other communications to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and
the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until
actually received by such Person. In no event shall a voicemail message be
effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.

         (b)      Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the
same force and effect as manually signed originals and shall be binding on all
Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a
manually signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request
or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document
or signature.

         (c)      Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and internet
and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications,
such as financial statements and other information as provided in Section 7.02,
and to distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and may
not be used for any other purpose.

         (d)      Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any
notices (including telephonic Loan Notices and Swing Line Loan Notices)
purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were
not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or
followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms
thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof.
The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all
losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such
Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All
telephonic notices to and other communications with the Administrative Agent may
be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to such recording.

11.03    NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.

         No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and
no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

11.04    ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES.

         The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent
for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development,
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the
provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby are consummated), and the consummation and administration of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all Attorney Costs
and costs and expenses in connection with the use of Intralinks, Inc. or other
similar information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, and
(b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and each Lender for all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement,
or preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout"
or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding,
including any

                                       86

<PAGE>

proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney Costs. The
foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search, filing, recording, title
insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes related thereto, and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the cost of
independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 11.04
shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments and repayment of all Obligations.

11.05    INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BORROWER.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person,
each Lender and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
counsel, trustees, advisors, agents and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the
"Indemnitees") from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever
which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such
Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of or in connection with (a)
the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of any Loan
Document or any other agreement, letter or instrument delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated thereby or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Revolving Commitment, Loan or Letter
of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any
refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit
if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (c) any actual or alleged presence or
release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly
owned or operated by the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or
any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower, any Subsidiary
or any other Loan Party, or (d) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory (including any investigation of, preparation
for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim, investigation, litigation or
proceeding) and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the
foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee
shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any
information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, nor shall
any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect or consequential damages
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its
activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the
Closing Date). All amounts due under this Section 11.05 shall be payable within
ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any
Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the Obligations.

11.06    PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.

         To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Loan Party is
made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or
any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of
such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then
(a) to the extent

                                       87

<PAGE>

of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable
share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent,
plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is
made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
effect.

11.07    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this
Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject
to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted
assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this
Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

         (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Loans (including
for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in
Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case
of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Revolving Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an
assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with
respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitment (which for
this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such
assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date"
is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not
be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise
consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part
of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loans or the Revolving Commitment assigned, except that this
clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of Swing Line Loans; and (iii)
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation
fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee
thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 11.04 and 11.05
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement

                                       88

<PAGE>

that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving
Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (d)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Revolving Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's
participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification
described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that directly affects such
Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that
each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and
3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.09
as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.

         (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
11.15 as though it were a Lender.

         (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

         (g)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and Loans
pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon thirty days'
notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon
thirty days' notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event
of any such

                                       89

<PAGE>

resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled
to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender
hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any
such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or
Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer,
it shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with
respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its
resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto
(including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk
participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of
America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the
Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made
by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including
the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk
participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

11.08    CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees
and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement;
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant
in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or
prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative
transaction relating to obligations of the Loan Parties; (g) with the consent of
the Borrower; (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary; or (i) to the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization or any nationally
recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender's or
its Affiliates' investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with
respect to such Lender or its Affiliates. In addition, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information
about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the
lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the Revolving Commitments, and the Credit Extensions.
For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received
from any Loan Party relating to any Loan Party or its business, other than any
such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on
a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party; provided that, in
the case of information received from a Loan Party after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified in writing at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, "Information" shall not include, and the Administrative Agent and each
Lender may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with respect
to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are provided to the Administrative Agent or such

                                       90

<PAGE>

Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that with
respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information
concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as
other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the
document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of
the Loans, Letters of Credit and transactions contemplated hereby.

11.09    SET-OFF.

         In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law,
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each
Lender and any Affiliate of a Lender is authorized at any time and from time to
time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such
notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each
Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for
the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all
Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now
or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent
or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or
denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or
indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

11.10    INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan
Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall
not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law
(the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive
interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall
be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid
principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal
parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder.

11.11    COUNTERPARTS.

         This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

11.12    INTEGRATION.

         This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the
complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such
subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement
shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in
favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document
shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was
drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall
be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance
with the fair meaning thereof.

                                       91

<PAGE>

11.13    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection
herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and
thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by
the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

11.14    SEVERABILITY.

         If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall
endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

11.15    TAX FORMS.

                  (a)      (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States person"
         within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code
         (a "Foreign Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior
         to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Internal
         Revenue Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein),
         two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any
         successor thereto (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to
         an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to
         be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this
         Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all
         payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to
         this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and
         the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an
         exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax, including any
         exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         Thereafter and from time to time, each such Foreign Lender shall (A)
         promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly
         completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor
         forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United
         States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current
         United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is
         satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any
         available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding
         taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by
         the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the
         Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify
         or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take such
         steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the
         reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary
         (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any
         requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or
         withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

                  (ii)     Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or
         ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any
         sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the

                                       92

<PAGE>

         Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation by
         such Lender), shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date
         when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect
         to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other
         times as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative
         Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly
         signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be
         provided by such Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of
         any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts
         for its own account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and
         (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any
         successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses
         to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of
         exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code, to establish that
         such Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion
         of any such sums payable to such Lender.

                  (iii)    The Borrower shall not be required to pay any
         additional amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with
         respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis
         of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender
         transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.15(a) or
         (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender shall
         have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the date
         such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with
         respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this
         Section 11.15(a) shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay
         any amounts pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as a result of
         any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,
         regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
         administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer
         properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
         subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person
         for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under
         any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject
         to withholding at a reduced rate.

                  (iv)     The Administrative Agent may, without reduction,
         withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any
         payment under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the
         Borrower is not required to pay additional amounts under this Section
         11.15(a).

         (b)      Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that
is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Internal Revenue Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed
completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms,
then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such
Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by
the Internal Revenue Code, without reduction.

         (c)      If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax
or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all
penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate

         Under any circumstances set forth herein providing that the Borrower
shall have the right to replace a Lender as a party to this Agreement, the
Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, replace
such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its Revolving Commitment and
outstanding Loans (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such
instance) pursuant to Section 11.07(b) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible
Assignees procured by the Borrower; provided, however, that if the Borrower
elects to exercise such right with respect to any Lender pursuant to Section
3.06(b), it shall be obligated to replace all Lenders that have made similar
requests for compensation pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04. The Borrower shall
(x) pay in full all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such
Lender through the date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant
to Section 3.05), (y) provide appropriate assurances and indemnities (which may
include letters of credit) to the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender as each
may reasonably require with respect to any continuing obligation to fund
participation interests in any L/C Obligations or any Swing Line Loans then
outstanding, and (z) release such Lender from its obligations under the Loan
Documents. Any Lender being replaced shall execute and deliver an Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such Lender's Revolving Commitment and outstanding
Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans.

the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26,
