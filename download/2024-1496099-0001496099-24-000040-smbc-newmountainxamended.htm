Each Syndicated Loan shall be made as part of a  Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class of Commitments, Currency and Type made by  the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable  Class.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any  other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are  several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender&#8217;s failure to make Loans as  required.   (b) Type of Loans.  Subject to Section 2.13, each Syndicated Borrowing of a  Class shall be constituted entirely of ABR Loans, RFR Loans or of Term Benchmark Loans of  such Class denominated in a single Currency as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this  Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request (or to elect to convert to or continue as a  Term Benchmark Borrowing) any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested therefor would end  after the Extended Final Maturity Date; provided that any request (or election to convert or  continue as a Term Benchmark Borrowing) that would extend past an applicable Non-Extended  Final Maturity Date may only be made with respect to the portion of the Term Benchmark  Borrowing held by the Extending Lenders and Non-Extending Lenders for which the Non- Extended Final Maturity Date shall not have occurred; provided further that the foregoing will not  release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to make Loans to the Borrower, in  each case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended Commitment  Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender.  (e) Treatment of Classes.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, with respect to each Syndicated Loan, Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit designated in  Dollars, the Administrative Agent shall deem the Borrower to have requested that such Syndicated  Loan, Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit be applied ratably to each of the Dollar Commitments  and the Multicurrency Commitments, based upon the percentage of the aggregate Commitments  represented by the Dollar Commitments and the Multicurrency Commitments, respectively.

If no election as to the Currency of a Syndicated Borrowing is specified, then the  requested Syndicated Borrowing shall be denominated in Dollars.  If no election as to the Type of  a Syndicated Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be a Term Benchmark  Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month and, if an Agreed Foreign Currency has been  specified, the requested Syndicated Borrowing shall be a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR  Borrowing, as applicable, denominated in such Agreed Foreign Currency and, in the case of any  such Term Benchmark Borrowing, having an Interest Period of one month.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  62  770580030  on the day such Refunding Loans are made, such Swingline Lender&#8217;s pro rata share of the  Refunded Swingline Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a Refunding Loan  made by such Swingline Lender to Borrower, and such portion of the Swingline Loans deemed to  be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swingline Loans but shall instead constitute part of  such Swingline Lender&#8217;s outstanding Multicurrency Loans or Dollar Loans, as applicable, to the  Borrower.  If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to such Swingline Lender  should be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from such Swingline Lender in bankruptcy,  by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall  be ratably shared among all Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.17.    (d) Participations by Lenders in Swingline Loans.  If for any reason Refunding  Loans are not made pursuant to Section 2.04(c) above in an amount sufficient to repay the  Refunded Swingline Loans on or before the third Business Day after demand for payment thereof  by such Swingline Lender, each Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure (other than Non- Extending Lenders for which such Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s applicable Non-Extended  Commitment Termination Date shall have occurred; provided that the foregoing will not release  any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to acquire or fund participations in Swingline  Loans, in each case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended  Commitment Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender) shall be deemed to, and hereby  agrees to, have purchased a participation in such outstanding Swingline Loans, and in an amount  equal to its Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage of the applicable  unpaid amount together with accrued interest thereon.  Upon one Business Day&#8217;s notice from such  Swingline Lender, each Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure shall deliver to the  Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Swingline Lender, an amount equal to its respective  participation in the applicable unpaid amount as provided below. In order to evidence such  participation each Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure agrees to enter into a participation  agreement at the request of such Swingline Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory  to such Swingline Lender.  In the event any Lender holding a Revolving Credit Exposure fails to  make available to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Swingline Lender, the amount of  such Lender&#8217;s participation as provided in this paragraph, such Swingline Lender shall be entitled  to recover such amount on demand from such Lender at the Alternate Base Rate.   Subject to the foregoing, each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation  to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph (d) is absolute and  unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence  and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments of the respective  Class, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or  reduction whatsoever.  Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire  transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with  respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the  payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the  applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  The Administrative  Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to  this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the  Administrative Agent and not to the relevant Swingline Lender.  Any amounts received by a  Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a  Swingline Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations    63  770580030  therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the  Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that  shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the applicable Swingline Lender,  as their interests may appear.  The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this  paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.  (e) Resignation and Replacement of Swingline Lender.  Any Swingline Lender  may resign and be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the  Administrative Agent, the resigning Swingline Lender and a successor Swingline Lender. The  Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such resignation and replacement of any  Swingline Lender. In addition to the foregoing, if a Lender becomes, and during the period it  remains, a Defaulting Lender, and if any Default has arisen from a failure of the Borrower to  comply with Section 2.19(a), then each Swingline Lender may, upon prior written notice to the  Borrower and the Administrative Agent, resign as a Swingline Lender, effective at the close of  business New York time on a date specified in such notice (which date may not be less than five  (5) Business Days after the date of such notice). On or after the effective date of any such  resignation, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may, by written agreement, appoint one  or more successor Swingline Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any  such appointment of a successor Swingline Lender. Upon the effectiveness of any resignation of  any Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall repay in full all outstanding Swingline Loans together  with all accrued interest thereon. From and after the effective date of the appointment of a  successor Swingline Lender, (i) such successor Swingline Lender shall have all the rights and  obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swingline  Loans to be made thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term &#8220;Swingline Lender&#8221; shall be  deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Swingline Lender, or to such successor and  all previous Swingline Lenders, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Swingline  Lender hereunder, the replaced Swingline Lender shall have no obligation to make additional  Swingline Loans.  (f) Designation of Additional Swingline Lenders.  The Borrower may, at any  time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not  be unreasonably withheld), designate as additional Swingline Lenders one (1) or more Lenders  with Revolving Credit Exposure that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below.  The  acceptance by a Lender with Revolving Credit Exposure of an appointment as a Swingline Lender  hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and  such designated Lender and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender  shall have all the rights and obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement and the other  Loan Documents and (ii) references herein or therein to the term &#8220;Swingline Lender&#8221; shall be  deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as a maker of Swingline Loans hereunder; provided  that each such agreement shall include an updated Schedule 2.05; provided, further, that the  Borrower shall not update Schedule 2.05 to increase any Swingline Lender&#8217;s maximum Swingline  Exposure without such Swingline Lender&#8217;s consent.    64  770580030  SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit.  (a) General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to  the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request any Issuing Bank to issue, at  any time and from time to time at least thirty (30) days prior to the Extended Commitment  Termination Date, during the Extended Availability Period and under either the Dollar  Commitments or Multicurrency Commitments, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or (in the  case of Letters of Credit under the Multicurrency Commitments) in any Agreed Foreign Currency  for its own account in such form as is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in its sole discretion.  Each  requested Letter of Credit must satisfy the requirements of this Agreement (unless waived to the  extent permitted by this Agreement) and such Issuing Bank's internal policies, forms and  procedures (unless waived by such Issuing Bank).   Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall  constitute utilization of the Commitments up to the aggregate amount available to be drawn  thereunder.  Without limiting any rights of an Issuing Bank under this Section 2.05, no Issuing  Bank shall be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit that is not a standby letter of credit.  (b) Notice of Issuance or Amendment.  To request the issuance of a Letter of  Credit (or an amendment to an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or  telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been  approved by such Issuing Bank) to any Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least three  (3) Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance) a notice requesting the issuance  of a Letter of Credit or amendment, and specifying the date of issuance or amendment (which shall  be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with  paragraph (d) of this Section), the amount and Currency of such Letter of Credit, whether such  Letter of Credit is to be issued under the Dollar Commitments or the Multicurrency Commitments,  the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary  to prepare such Letter of Credit or amendment.  If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the  Borrower also shall submit to such Issuing Bank a letter of credit application on such Issuing  Bank&#8217;s standard forms in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.  In the event of any  inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions  of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or  entered into by the Borrower with, such Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms  and conditions of this Agreement shall control.  (c) Limitations on Amounts.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended,  only if (and upon issuance or amendment of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed  to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance or amendment (i) the aggregate  LC Exposure of the Issuing Banks (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the  participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed  $50,000,000, (ii) the total Revolving Dollar Credit Exposures of Dollar Lenders with Dollar  Commitments then in effect shall not exceed the aggregate Dollar Commitments at such time, (iii)  the total Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures of Multicurrency Lenders with Multicurrency  Commitments then in effect shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments at such  time, (iv) with respect to each Issuing Bank that is a Swingline Lender with a Multicurrency  Commitment, the sum of such Swingline Lender&#8217;s outstanding Multicurrency Loans, its  Multicurrency LC Exposure, its outstanding Swingline Loans and (without duplication) its other  Swingline Exposure shall not exceed its Multicurrency Commitment then in effect, (v) with respect    65  770580030  to each Issuing Bank that is a Swingline Lender with a Dollar Commitment, the sum of such  Swingline Lender&#8217;s outstanding Dollar Loans, its Dollar LC Exposure, its outstanding Swingline  Loans and (without duplication) its other Swingline Exposure shall not exceed its Dollar  Commitment then in effect, (vi) the LC Exposure of the applicable Issuing Bank requested to issue  such Letter of Credit (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations  therein of the Lenders  pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed the amount set  forth opposite the name of such Issuing Bank on Schedule 2.05 and (vii) the total Covered Debt  Amount shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect.  The minimum initial amount of each  Letter of Credit shall be $250,000 and no more than ten (10) Letters of Credit may be outstanding  at any one time.  (d) Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall provide that it expires within  one year from the date of issuance. If a Letter of Credit also provides for automatic extension, such  Letter of Credit must also provide for automatic expiration at the initial or any subsequent  expiration date upon such Issuing Bank's sending a notice of non-extension to the beneficiary  reasonably before the then current expiration date, that no automatic extension may exceed one  year in duration, and that the Letter of Credit must in all events expire on a final and certain date  stated in the Letter of Credit that is not later than ten (10) days prior to the Extended Commitment  Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Letter of Credit is outstanding following  the earlier to occur of the Extended Commitment Termination Date and the Termination Date, the  Letter of Credit must be Cash Collateralized in an amount of at least 102% of the undrawn face  amount and any unreimbursed drawings not honored or refused of each Letter of Credit on terms  acceptable to such Issuing Bank, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Extended  Commitment Termination Date or Termination Date, as applicable, or supported by another letter  of credit approved by such Issuing Bank, and (ii) the Borrower pays in full prior to the Extended  Commitment Termination Date all commissions, fees and expenses required to be paid with  respect to any such Letter of Credit through the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit  (and, in that connection, the Lenders agree not later than the date two Business Days after the date  upon which the last such Letter of Credit shall expire or be terminated to rebate to the Borrower  the excess, if any, of the aggregate participation and fronting fees that have been prepaid by the  Borrower over the sum of the amount of such fees that ultimately accrue through the date of such  expiration or termination and the aggregate amount of all other unpaid obligations hereunder at  such time), in each case pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank  and the Administrative Agent.  (e) Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit of a Class of  Commitment (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by any Issuing  Bank, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing  Bank hereby grant to each Lender (other than any Non-Extending Lender for which such Non- Extending Lender&#8217;s applicable Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date has occurred;  provided that the foregoing will not release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation  to acquire or fund participations in Letters of Credit, in each case, that was required to be  performed on or prior to the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for such Non- Extending Lender) of such Class, and each Lender of such Class hereby acquires from such Issuing  Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Dollar Percentage  or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, of the aggregate amount available to  be drawn under such Letter of Credit.

Unless an Issuing Bank has received written notice  from the Required Lenders of the Respective Class or the Borrower, at least two (2) Business Days  prior to the requested date of issuance of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable  conditions contained in Section 4.02 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and  conditions hereof, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to assume all such conditions are satisfied.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender of a Class (other  than any Non-Extending Lender for which such Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s applicable Non- Extended Commitment Termination Date has occurred; provided that that foregoing will not  release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to acquire or fund participations in  Letters of Credit, in each case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended  Commitment Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender) hereby absolutely and  unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of each Issuing Bank, such  Lender&#8217;s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may  be, of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in respect of Letters of Credit of such  Class promptly upon the request of such Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such LC  Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any  reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Such payment  shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each such  payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made  by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the  Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the  amounts so received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative  Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to the next following paragraph, the  Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent  that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank,  then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by  a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall  not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC  Disbursement.  (f) Reimbursement.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in  respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in respect of such  LC Disbursement by paying to such Issuing Bank an amount equal to such LC Disbursement in  the Currency in which such Letter of Credit is denominated not later than 3:00 p.m., New York  time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such  notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately  following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to    67  770580030  such time; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $100,000 and is denominated  in Dollars, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in  accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with a Syndicated ABR  Borrowing or a Swingline Loan of the respective Class in an equivalent amount and, to the extent  so financed, the Borrower&#8217;s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by  the resulting Syndicated ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan and in the event the Borrower elects  to finance the LC Disbursement, the Administrative Agent shall pay to such Issuing Bank the  proceeds of such Loan.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due and does not request and  receive a Syndicated ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan in the unpaid amount pursuant to Section  2.05(f) hereof, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender with a Commitment  then in effect of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in  respect thereof and such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency  Percentage, as the case may be, thereof.  (g) Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower&#8217;s obligation to reimburse LC  Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and  irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under  any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability  of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented  under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement  therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter  of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the  terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or  not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a  legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower&#8217;s obligations hereunder.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders, the Issuing Banks or  any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in  connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Banks or any  payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances  referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in  transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter  of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in  interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the  Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from  liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages,  claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable  law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank&#8217;s fraud, gross negligence or  willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter  of Credit comply with the terms thereof as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a  final and non-appealable judgement.  The parties hereto expressly agree that:  (i) the Issuing Banks may accept documents that appear on their face to be in  substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further  investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make    68  770580030  payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial  compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit;  (ii) the Issuing Banks shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to  accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict  compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and  (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the  Issuing Banks when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a  Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the  extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).  (h) Disbursement Procedures.  Each Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable  time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for  payment under a Letter of Credit.  The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly after such  examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of such demand for  payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;  provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of  its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such  LC Disbursement.  (i) Interim Interest.  If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement,  then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC  Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and  including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower  reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Syndicated ABR  Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two  Business Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then the  provisions of Section 2.12(c) shall apply automatically without further action by the Lenders.   Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of the applicable Issuing Bank,  except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph  (f) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for account of such Lender to the extent  of such payment.  (j) Resignation and/or Replacement of an Issuing Bank.  Any Issuing Bank  may resign and be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the  Administrative Agent, the resigning Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. In addition, if  any Issuing Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, assigns all of its Loans and Commitments in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank  hereunder upon not less than thirty days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the  Borrower.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such resignation and  replacement of an Issuing Bank.  Upon the effectiveness of any resignation of an Issuing Bank,  the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of the resigning Issuing Bank pursuant  to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of the appointment of a successor Issuing  Bank, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing  Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii)  references herein to the term &#8220;Issuing Bank&#8221; shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any    69  770580030  previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall  require. After the effective resignation of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the resigning Issuing Bank,  as the case may be, shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and  obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it  prior to such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or amend  outstanding Letters of Credit  (k) Cash Collateralization.  If the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash  Collateral for LC Exposure pursuant to Section 2.05(d), Section 2.10(b) or (c) or the last paragraph  of Article VII, the Borrower shall promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days, deposit  into a segregated collateral account or accounts (herein, collectively, the &#8220;Letter of Credit  Collateral Account&#8221;) in the name and under the dominion and control of such Issuing Bank Cash  denominated in the Currency of the Letter of Credit under which such LC Exposure arises in an  amount equal to the amount required under Section 2.05(d), Section 2.10(b) or (c) or the last  paragraph of Article VII, as applicable.  Such deposit shall be held by such Issuing Bank or its  agent as collateral in the first instance for the LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter  for the payment of the &#8220;Secured Obligations&#8221; under and as defined in the Guarantee and Security  Agreement, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest (subject only to  Liens of the type described in clause (g) of the definition of Permitted Liens and unrecorded Liens  permitted hereunder which have priority over the Liens on the Collateral by operation of law) to  such Issuing Bank in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined  in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property held therein.  If the Borrower is required to  provide Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such Cash  Collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the  Borrower promptly after all Events of Default have been waived.  If the Borrower is required to  provide Cash Collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii), such Cash Collateral (to the  extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the Borrower promptly  as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency  Credit Exposures would not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments.  (l) No Obligation to Issue After Certain Events.  No Issuing Bank shall be  under any obligation to issue, amend, reinstate or extend any Letter of Credit if:  any order,  judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin  or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing, amending, reinstating or extending such Letter of  Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not  having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing  Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank shall refrain from, the issuance of letters of  credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with  respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such  Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall  impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable  on the Effective Date and which such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it, or the  issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank  applicable to letters of credit generally.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  70  770580030  Standby Practices shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform  Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International  Chamber of Commerce at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.  (n) Additional Issuing Banks.  From time to time, the Borrower may, by notice  to the Administrative Agent, designate one or more additional Lenders with Revolving Credit  Exposure as an Issuing Bank, so long as each such Lender agrees (in its sole discretion) to act in  such capacity and is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; provided that each such  notice shall include an updated Schedule 2.05; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not update  Schedule 2.05 to increase any Issuing Bank&#8217;s maximum LC Exposure without such Issuing Bank&#8217;s  consent.  Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement upon  the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,  delayed or conditioned) and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes.  SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings.  (a) Funding by Lenders.  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it  hereunder by wire transfer of immediately available funds by (i) 11:00 a.m., New York time, on  the date of Borrowing specified in the applicable Borrowing Request for any Loan denominated  in Dollars or Canadian Dollars, (ii) 9:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of Borrowing specified  in the applicable Borrowing Request for any Loan denominated in English Pounds Sterling or  Euros, or (iii) 6:00 p.m., New York time, on the date before the date of Borrowing specified in the  applicable Borrowing Notice for any Loan denominated in Australian Dollars, to the account of  the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;  provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04.  The Administrative  Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so  received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable  Borrowing Request; provided that Syndicated ABR Borrowings made to finance the  reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f) shall be remitted by the  Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.  (b) Presumption by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that  such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such  Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available  on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such  assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender  has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent,  then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree that the Administrative Agent may  recover such corresponding amount with interest thereon for each day from and including the date  such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the  Administrative Agent as follows: (a) in the case of such Lender, at the Federal Funds Effective  Rate; or (b) in the case of the Borrower, at the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such  Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such  Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Lender of  its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and this paragraph shall be without prejudice    71  770580030  to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment  to the Administrative Agent.  SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections.  (a) Elections by the Borrower for Syndicated Borrowings.  Subject to  Section 2.03(d), the Loans constituting each Syndicated Borrowing initially shall be of the Type  specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing,  shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may  elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing  as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect the  Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section; provided, however, that (i) a Syndicated  Borrowing of a Class may only be continued or converted into a Syndicated Borrowing of the  same Class, (ii)  except as set forth in Sections 2.13, 2.20(e) and 2.21, a Syndicated Borrowing  denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted to, a Syndicated Borrowing  in a different Currency, (iii) no Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency  may be continued if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit  Exposures would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments, and (iv)  neither a Term  Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency nor a RFR Borrowing may not be  converted to a Borrowing of a different Type.  The Borrower may elect different options with  respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be  allocated ratably among the Lenders of the respective Class holding the Loans constituting such  Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.   This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.  (b) Notice of Elections.  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the  Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election in writing by the time that a  Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a  Syndicated Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date  of such election.  Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be in a form  approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.  (c) Content of Interest Election Requests.  Each Interest Election Request shall  specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  (i) the Borrowing (including the Class of Commitment) to which such Interest  Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different  portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which  case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall  be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election  Request, which shall be a Business Day;  (iii) whether, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, the resulting  Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and    72  770580030  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest  Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated  by the definition of the term &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; and permitted under Section 2.02(d).  (d) Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders.  Promptly following  receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable  Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender&#8217;s portion of each resulting Borrowing.  (e) Failure to Elect; Events of Default.  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely  and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the  end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if  such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall  be converted to a Syndicated Term Benchmark Borrowing of the same Class having an Interest  Period of one month, and (ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the  Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month&#8217;s duration.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the  Borrower, (i) any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall, at the end of the  applicable Interest Period for such Term Benchmark Borrowing, be automatically converted to an  ABR Borrowing and (ii) any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency  shall not have an Interest Period of more than one month&#8217;s duration.  SECTION 2.08. Termination, Reduction or Increase of the Commitments.  (a) Scheduled Termination.  Unless previously terminated, the Commitments  of each Extending Lender with respect to such Extending Lender&#8217;s Extended Loans shall terminate  on the Extended Commitment Termination Date and the Commitments of each Non-Extending  Lender with respect to such Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s Non-Extended Loans shall terminate on the  Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for such Non-Extending Lender; provided that the  foregoing will not release any Non-Extending Lender from any such obligation to make Loans to  the Borrower, or acquire or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans, in each  case, that was required to be performed on or prior to the Non-Extended Commitment Termination  Date for such Non-Extending Lender.  (b) Voluntary Termination or Reduction.  The Borrower may at any time  terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of either Class of Commitment, ratably  among the Lenders of such Class of Commitment; provided that (i) each reduction of the  Commitments of a Class shall be in an amount that is $5,000,000 (or, if less, the entire amount of  the Commitments of such Class) or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) the  Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments of either Class of Commitment if, after  giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Syndicated Loans of such Class in accordance  with Section 2.10, the total Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total  Commitments of such Class.  Any such reduction of the Commitments below the principal amount  of the Swingline Loans permitted under Section 2.04(a)(i) and the Letters of Credit permitted under  Section 2.05(c)(i) shall result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of such amounts as applicable.    73  770580030  (c) Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction.  The Borrower shall notify  the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph  (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or  reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of  any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof.   Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that  a notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class delivered by the Borrower may  state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or a transaction  contemplated by Section 2.10(d), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by  notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is  not satisfied.  (d) Effect of Termination or Reduction.  Any termination or reduction of the  Commitments of a Class of Commitments pursuant to clause (b) shall be permanent.  Each  reduction of the Commitments of a Class of Commitments pursuant to clause (b) shall be made  ratably among the Lenders of such Class (including with respect to (x) Dollar Lenders and  Multicurrency Lenders and (y) Extending Lenders and Non-Extending Lenders) in accordance  with their respective Commitments.  (e) Increase of the Commitments.  (i) Requests for Increase by Borrower.  The Borrower may, at any time, request  that the Commitments hereunder of a Class of Commitments be increased (each such  proposed increase being a &#8220;Commitment Increase&#8221;), upon notice to the Administrative  Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders), which notice shall specify each existing  Lender (each an &#8220;Increasing Lender&#8221;) and/or each additional lender (each an &#8220;Assuming  Lender&#8221;) that shall have agreed to an additional Commitment and the date on which such  increase is to be effective (the &#8220;Commitment Increase Date&#8221;), which shall be a Business  Day at least three Business Days (or such lesser period as the Administrative Agent may  reasonably agree) after delivery of such notice and at least 30 days prior to the Extended  Commitment Termination Date; provided that:  (A) the minimum amount of the Commitment of any Assuming Lender,  and the minimum amount of the increase of the Commitment of any Increasing  Lender, as part of such Commitment Increase shall be $5,000,000 or a larger  multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser amount as the  Administrative Agent may reasonably agree);  (B) immediately after giving effect to such Commitment Increase  (including, if applicable, the substantially concurrent reduction of the  Commitments of a Non-Extending Lender in accordance with Section 2.08(f)), the  total Commitments of all of the Lenders hereunder shall not exceed $790,000,000;  (C) each Assuming Lender shall be consented to by the Administrative  Agent, each Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank (such consent not to be  unreasonably withheld);  </FONT></DIV>

On the  Commitment Increase Date, the Borrower shall (A) prepay the outstanding Loans (if  any) of the affected Class of Commitments in full, (B) simultaneously borrow new Loans  of such Class hereunder in an amount equal to such prepayment; provided that with respect  to subclauses (A) and (B), (x) the prepayment to, and borrowing from, any existing Lender  shall be effected by book entry to the extent that any portion of the amount prepaid to such  Lender will be subsequently borrowed from such Lender and (y) the existing Lenders, the  Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders shall make and receive payments among  themselves, in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that, after giving effect  thereto, the Loans of such Class are held ratably by the Lenders of such Class in accordance  with the respective Commitments of such Class of such Lenders (after giving effect to such  Commitment Increase) and (C) pay to the Lenders of such Class the amounts, if any,  payable under Section 2.15 as a result of any such prepayment.  Concurrently therewith,  the Lenders of such Class shall be deemed to have adjusted their participation interests in  any outstanding Letters of Credit of such Class so that such interests are held ratably in  accordance with their Revolving Commitments of such Class as so increased.  (v) Terms of Loans Issued on the Commitment Increase Date.  The terms and  provisions of any new Loans issued by any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, and  the Commitment Increase of any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, shall be identical  to the terms and provisions of Loans issued by, and the Commitments of, the Revolving  Lenders immediately prior to the applicable Commitment Increase Date (except that any  upfront or similar one-time fee may be different).  (f) Reduction of Non-Extending Lenders&#8217; Commitment. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein (including Section 2.08(d)):  (i) The Borrower may at any time (x) terminate, or from time to time reduce,  the Commitment of any Non-Extending Lender without reducing the Commitments of any  other Lender of the same Class of Commitments of such Non-Extending Lender or (y) at  any time after a Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date  and so long as (1) no Event of Default exists, (2) no event or condition exists which, upon  notice, lapse of time or both would, unless cured or waived, become an Event of Default  under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Section 7.01 and (3) the Borrowing Base exceeds the  Covered Debt Amount at such time, prepay the Loans of such Non-Extending Lender  without prepaying the Loans of any other Lender of the same Class of Commitments of  such Non-Extending Lender; provided that each reduction of the Commitment or  prepayment of Loans of a Non-Extending Lender pursuant to this clause (f) shall be in an    76  770580030  amount that is $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in each  case, the entire Commitment or outstanding Loans of such Non-Extending Lender, as  applicable).  (ii) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to  terminate or reduce the Commitment or prepay the Loans of any Non-Extending Lender  under this clause (f) at least two Business Days (or such lesser period as the Administrative  Agent may reasonably agree) prior to (x) the related Commitment Increase Date in the case  of any termination or reduction or (y) the effective date of such prepayment, in each case,  specifying such election and the related Commitment Increase Date or effective date  thereof, as applicable. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent  shall advise each Lender of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower  pursuant to this clause (f) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or  reduction may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events,  in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative  Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  (iii) Any termination or reduction of the Commitment or prepayment of Loans  of any Non-Extending Lender pursuant to this clause (f) shall be permanent and, if  applicable in connection with any termination or reduction of Commitments, shall be made  concurrently with all required reallocations, prepayments and cash collateralizations  required under Section 2.21; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if any Loans or  Letters of Credit are outstanding, no reduction or termination of Commitments shall be  made pursuant to this Section 2.08(f) if the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are not  satisfied on the date of such reduction or termination.  SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a) Repayment.  The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay the  Loans of each Class of Commitments, as applicable, as follows:  (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders of such Class the  outstanding principal amount of the Syndicated Loans of the Lenders of such Class and all  other amounts due and owing hereunder and under the other Loan Documents on such  Lenders&#8217; applicable Final Maturity Date; and  (ii) to the applicable Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each  Swingline Loan of such Class of Commitment denominated in Dollars made by such  Swingline Lender, as provided in Section 2.04; provided that on each date that a Syndicated  Borrowing of such Class of Commitment is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline  Loans of such Class of Commitment then outstanding.  (b) Manner of Payment.  Prior to any repayment or prepayment of any  Borrowings to any Lenders of any Class of Commitment hereunder, the Borrower shall select the  Borrowing or Borrowings of such Class to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by  telephone (confirmed in writing) of such selection not later than the time set forth in Section  2.10(e) prior to the scheduled date of such repayment; provided that each repayment of Borrowings    77  770580030  in Dollars to any Lenders of a Class shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of  such Class before any other Borrowings of such Class.  If the Borrower fails to make a timely  selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied  to repay Borrowings in the same Currency and, solely in the case of any such payment in Dollars,  first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the applicable Class and, second, to other  Borrowings of such Class in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods  (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first).  Other than in  connection with a reduction or termination of Commitments or prepayment of Loans pursuant to  Section 2.08(f), the occurrence of the Final Maturity Date with respect to any Lender pursuant to  Section 2.09(a) or a mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(d), each payment of a  Syndicated Borrowing to Lenders of a Class shall be applied ratably (both with respect to (x)  Dollar Loans and Multicurrency Loans and (y) Extended Loans and Non-Extended Loans) to the  Loans included in such Borrowing.  (c) Maintenance of Records by Lenders.  Each Lender shall maintain in  accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such  Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of  principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.  (d) Maintenance of Records by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative  Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan  made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount and  Currency of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the  Borrower to each Lender of such Class of Commitment hereunder and (iii) the amount and  Currency of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for account of the Lenders  and each Lender&#8217;s share thereof.  (e) Effect of Entries.  The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to  paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence, absent obvious error, of the  existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender  or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner  affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement.  (f) Promissory Notes.  Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made  by it be evidenced by a promissory note; in such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and  deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender,  to such Lender and its registered permitted assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative  Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all  times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more  promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is  a registered note, to such payee and its registered, permitted assigns).  SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans.  (a) Optional Prepayments.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and  from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty except  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  78  770580030  for payments under Section 2.15, subject to the requirements of this Section.  Any prepayment of  a Borrowing made in accordance with this clause (a) shall be applied ratably among the Lenders  of a Class of Commitment unless such prepayment is made in connection with the reduction of  Commitments in accordance with Section 2.08(b) or 2.08(f) in which case such prepayment shall  be applied in accordance with Section 2.08(d) or 2.08(f), as applicable.  (b) Mandatory Prepayments due to Changes in Exchange Rates.  (i) Determination of Amount Outstanding.  On each Quarterly Date and, in  addition, promptly upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Currency Valuation  Notice (as defined below), the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate  Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure.  For the purpose of this determination, the  outstanding principal amount of any Loan or Letter Credit that is denominated in any  Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign  Currency of such Loan or Letter of Credit, determined as of such Quarterly Date or, in the  case of a Currency Valuation Notice received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00  a.m., New York time, on a Business Day, on such Business Day or, in the case of a  Currency Valuation Notice otherwise received, on the first Business Day after such  Currency Valuation Notice is received.  Upon making such determination, the  Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Multicurrency Lenders, the Issuing Banks  and the Borrower thereof.  (ii) Prepayment.  If on the date of such determination the aggregate Revolving  Multicurrency Credit Exposure minus the Multicurrency LC Exposure fully Cash  Collateralized on such date exceeds 105% of the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency  Commitments as then in effect, the Borrower shall, prepay the Syndicated Multicurrency  Loans and Swingline Multicurrency Loans (and/or provide Cash Collateral for  Multicurrency LC Exposure as specified in Section 2.05(k)) within 15 Business Days  following the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of such request in such amounts as shall be necessary so  that after giving effect thereto the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure  does not exceed the Multicurrency Commitments.  For purposes hereof &#8220;Current Valuation Notice&#8221; means a notice given by the Required  Multicurrency Lenders or the Issuing Banks to the Administrative Agent stating that such notice  is a &#8220;Currency Valuation Notice&#8221; and requesting that the Administrative Agent determine the  aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure.  The Administrative Agent shall not be  required to make more than one valuation determination pursuant to Currency Valuation Notices  within any rolling three month period.  Any prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied, first to Swingline  Multicurrency Loans outstanding, second, to Syndicated Multicurrency Loans outstanding and  third, as cover for Multicurrency LC Exposure.  (c) Mandatory Prepayments due to Borrowing Base Deficiency.  In the event  that at any time any Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist, the Borrower shall, within five  Business Days after delivery of the applicable Borrowing Base Certificate, prepay the Loans (or  provide Cash Collateral for Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)) or reduce Other    79  770580030  Covered Indebtedness or any other Indebtedness that is included in the Covered Debt Amount at  such time or otherwise remedy the Borrowing Base Deficiency in such amounts as shall be  necessary so that such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured; provided that (i) the aggregate amount  of such prepayment of Loans (and Cash Collateral for Letters of Credit) shall be at least equal to  the Revolving Percentage times the aggregate prepayment of the Covered Debt Amount, and (ii) if,  within five (5) Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such  Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower shall present the Administrative Agent with a  reasonably feasible plan to enable such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be cured within 30 Business  Days (which 30-Business Day period shall include the five Business Days permitted for delivery  of such plan), then such prepayment or reduction shall not be required to be effected immediately  but may be effected in accordance with such plan (with such modifications as the Borrower may  reasonably determine), so long as such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within such 30- Business Day period.  (d) Mandatory Prepayments During Amortization Period.  During the period  commencing on the date immediately following the Commitment Termination Date with respect  to any Loans of any Lender or Lenders and ending on the Final Maturity Date with respect to the  Loans of such Lender or Lenders:  (i) Asset Disposition.  If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a  Financing Subsidiary) Disposes of any property which results in the receipt by such Person  of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate since the applicable  Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount  of such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds  no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such  prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b));  (ii) Equity Issuance.  Upon the sale or issuance by the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries (other than a Financing Subsidiary) of any of its Equity Interests (other than  any sales or issuances of Equity Interests to the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor),  the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed to such  Lender or Lenders equal to 75% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than  the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayments  to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b));  (iii) Indebtedness.  Upon the incurrence or issuance by the Borrower or any of  its Subsidiaries (other than a Financing Subsidiary) of any Indebtedness (excluding any  Permitted Advisor Loan or the making of any Loans or issuance of any Letters of Credit  hereunder), the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed  to such Lender or Lenders equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no  later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such  prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b));  (iv) Extraordinary Receipt.  Upon any Extraordinary Receipt (which, when  taken with all other Extraordinary Receipts received after the applicable Commitment  Termination Date, exceeds $5,000,000 in the aggregate) received by or paid to or for the  account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a Financing Subsidiary), and    80  770580030  not otherwise included in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 2.10(d), the Borrower shall  prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders equal  to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom no later than the fifth Business Day  following the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayments to be applied as set  forth in Section 2.09(b)); and  (v) Return of Capital.  If any Obligor shall receive any Return of Capital (other  than from any other Obligor or arising from any Transferred Assets), the Borrower shall  prepay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders equal  to 90% of such Return of Capital (excluding amounts payable by the Borrower pursuant to  Section 2.15) no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such Return of  Capital (such prepayments to be applied as set forth in Section 2.09(b));   provided, that if the Loans to be prepaid pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) above are Term  Benchmark Loans, the Borrower may defer such prepayment until the last day of the Interest  Period applicable to such Loans owed to such Lender or Lenders, so long as the Borrower deposits  an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds, no later than the fifth Business Day following the  receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, into a segregated collateral account in the name and under the  dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, pending application of such amount to the  prepayment of the Loans on the last day of such Interest Period; and provided further, that the  Administrative Agent may direct the application of such deposits as set forth in Section 2.09(b) at  any time and if the Administrative Agent does so, no amounts will be payable by the Borrower  pursuant to Section 2.15.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied to the  prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) shall (A) (I) from the period commencing  on the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date and ending on the Extended Commitment  Termination Date, be applied ratably among the Non-Extending Lenders for which the Non- Extended Commitment Termination Date shall have occurred and (II) from the Extended  Commitment Termination Date to the Extended Final Maturity Date, be applied ratably among the  Extending Lenders and shall be made in accordance with the Guarantee and Security Agreement  and (B) exclude the amount necessary for the Borrower to make all required distributions (which  shall be no less than the amount estimated in good faith by Borrower under Section 6.05(b) herein)  to maintain the status of a RIC under the Code and a &#8220;business development company&#8221; under the  Investment Company Act for so long as the Borrower retains such status and to avoid payment by  the Borrower of federal income taxes and federal excise Taxes imposed by Section 4982 of the  Code for so long as the Borrower retains the status of a RIC under the Code, and (C) if the Loans  to be prepaid are Term Benchmark Loans, the Borrower may defer such prepayment until the last  day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loans, so long as the Borrower deposits an amount  equal to such Net Cash Proceeds, no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of such  Net Cash Proceeds, into a segregated collateral account in the name and under the dominion and  control of the Administrative Agent, pending application of such amount to the prepayment of the  Loans on the last day of such Interest Period; provided, further, that the Administrative Agent may  direct the application of such deposits as set forth in Section 2.09(b) at any time and if the  Administrative Agent does so, no amounts will be payable by the Borrower pursuant to Section  2.15.    81  770580030  (e) Notices, Etc.  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in  the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, such Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed in  writing) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Term Benchmark  Borrowing denominated in Dollars (other than in the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section  2.10(d)), not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, three Business Days before the date of  prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in  a  Foreign Currency (other than in the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(d)), not later  than 11:00 a.m., Applicable Time, four Business Days before the date of prepayment, (iii) in the  case of prepayment of a RFR Borrowing (other than in the case of a prepayment pursuant to  Section 2.10(d)), not later than 11:00 a.m., London time, four Business Days before the date of  prepayment, (iv) in the case of prepayment of a Syndicated ABR Borrowing (other than in the case  of a prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(d)), not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, one  Business Day before the date of prepayment, (v) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan,  not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of prepayment, or (vi) in the case of any  prepayment pursuant to Section 2.10(d), not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, one Business  Day before the date of prepayment or, in each case of the notice periods described in this paragraph  (e), such lesser periods as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree.  Each such notice shall  be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or  portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed  calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if (i) a notice of prepayment is given  in connection with a conditional notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class  as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of  termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08 and (ii) any notice given in connection  with Section 2.10(d) may be conditioned on the consummation of the applicable transaction  contemplated by such Section and the receipt by the Borrower or any such Subsidiary (other than  a Financing Subsidiary) of Net Cash Proceeds.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice  relating to a Syndicated Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the affected Lenders of  the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would  be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02 or in the  case of a Swingline Loan, as provided in Section 2.04, except as necessary to apply fully the  required amount of a mandatory prepayment or scheduled payment.  Each prepayment of a  Syndicated Borrowing of a Class of Commitments shall be applied ratably to the Loans held by  the Lenders of such Class included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied  by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and shall be made in the manner specified  in Section 2.09(b) unless such prepayment is made in connection with the reduction of  Commitments in accordance with Section 2.08(b) or 2.08(f) or a mandatory prepayment pursuant  to Section 2.10(d), in which case such prepayment shall be applied in accordance with Section  2.08(d), 2.08(f) or Section 2.10(d), as applicable.

(c) Default Interest.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Event of Default  has occurred and is continuing and the Required Lenders have elected to increase pricing, the  interest rates applicable to Loans and any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder  shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of  principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above, (ii)  in the case of any Letter of Credit, 2% plus the fee otherwise applicable to such Letter of Credit as  provided in Section 2.11(b)(i), or (iii) in the case of any fee or other amount, 2% plus the rate  applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a  year of 360 days, except that interest computed (i) by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times    84  770580030  when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate and (ii) on Multicurrency Loans  denominated in English Pounds Sterling or Canadian Dollars shall be computed on the basis of a  year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual  number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable  Alternate Base Rate or Relevant Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent and such  determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest.    (a) Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 2.13, if (i) prior  to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing of a Class or (ii)  at any time for a RFR Borrowing (the Currency of such Borrowing herein called the &#8220;Affected  Currency&#8221;):  (i)  (A) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Administrative Agent  shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding  upon the Borrower absent manifest error) that the Relevant Rate for the Affected Currency  cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof for such Interest Period or (B) in  the case of a RFR Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good  faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower absent  manifest error) that the Daily Simple RFR for the Affected Currency cannot be determined  pursuant to the definition thereof; or  (ii) (A) in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Administrative Agent  shall have received notice from the Required Lenders of such Class of Commitments that  the Relevant Rate for the Affected Currency for such Interest Period will not adequately  and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their  respective Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period or (B) in the case of  a RFR Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required  Multicurrency Lenders that the Daily Simple RFR for the Affected Currency will not  adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining  the Loans included in such RFR Borrowing;  then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof (or telephonic notice, promptly  confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and the affected Lenders as promptly as practicable  thereafter identifying the relevant provision above.  Until the Administrative Agent shall notify  the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist,  (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Syndicated Borrowing to, or  the continuation of any Syndicated Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in  the Affected Currency shall be ineffective and, if the Affected Currency is Dollars, such  Syndicated Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, a Syndicated ABR  Borrowing at the end of the applicable Interest Period, (ii) if the Affected Currency is Dollars and  any Borrowing Request requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such  Borrowing shall be made as a Syndicated ABR Borrowing, (iii) if the Affected Currency is a  Foreign Currency other than Canadian Dollars, (A) any Borrowing Request that requests a Term  Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be made  as a Term Benchmark Borrowing with a Relevant Rate equal to the Central Bank Rate for the    85  770580030  applicable Agreed Foreign Currency; provided, that if the Administrative Agent determines (which  determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate  for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, such Borrowing Request shall  be ineffective, and (B) any outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing in the  Affected Currency, at the Borrower&#8217;s election shall either (1) be converted to a Syndicated  Borrowing bearing interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency;  provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive  and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign  Currency cannot be determined, such Borrowing shall be converted into a Syndicated ABR  Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected  Currency) immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark  Borrowing, at the end of the applicable Interest Period, (2) be converted into a Syndicated ABR  Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected  Currency) immediately in the case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark  Borrowing, at the end of the applicable Interest Period, or (3) be prepaid in full immediately in the  case of an RFR Borrowing or, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, at the end of the  applicable Interest Period, and (iv) if the Affected Currency is Canadian Dollars, (A) any  Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars  shall be made as a Term Benchmark Borrowing with a Relevant Rate equal to the Canadian Prime  Rate; provided, that if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be  conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Canadian Prime Rate cannot be determined,  such Borrowing Request shall be ineffective, and (B) any outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing  in Canadian Dollars, at the Borrower&#8217;s election, shall either (1) be converted to a Term Benchmark  Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars with a Relevant Rate equal to the Canadian Prime  Rate at the end of applicable Interest Period; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines,  which determination shall be conclusive and biding absent manifest error) that the Canadian Prime  Rate cannot be determined, such Borrowing shall be converted into a Syndicated ABR Borrowing  denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected Currency)  at the end of the applicable Interest Period, (2) be converted into a Syndicated ABR Borrowing  denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Affected Currency)  at the end of the applicable Interest Period, or (3) be prepaid in full at the end of the applicable  Interest Period; provided that if no election is made by the Borrower by the date that is three  Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of such notice or, in the case of a Term Benchmark  Borrowing, the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Term Benchmark Loan, if  earlier, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (iii)(B)(1) or (iv)(B)(1) above, as  applicable.  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan  Document (and any Hedging Agreement shall be deemed not to be a &#8220;Loan Document&#8221; for  purposes of this Section 2.13), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark  Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then- current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with any  of clauses (1) through (4) of the definition of &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221; for such Benchmark  Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes  hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent  Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to,  this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  86  770580030  in accordance with clause (5) of the definition of &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221; for such Benchmark  Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes  hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting on the fifth (5th)  Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders  without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or  any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time,  written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the  Required Lenders of each affected Class.  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan  Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, with respect to a Loan denominated  in Euros, if a Term ESTR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, as  applicable, have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current  Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark  for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and  subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any  other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, this clause (c) shall not  be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the Borrower a Term  ESTR Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver  any Term ESTR Notice after the occurrence of a Term ESTR Transition Event, and may do so in  its sole discretion.  (d) In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark  Replacement or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming  Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other  Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective  without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.  (e) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the  Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any  Conforming Changes, (iii) the commencement of a Benchmark Transition Event and (iv) the  commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election  that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders)  pursuant to this Section 2.13, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or  adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any  decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest  error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party  hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.13.  (f) At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a  Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR  or Term ESTR), then the Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is  unavailable or non-representative for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings  and (ii) the Administrative Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Benchmark  (including Benchmark Replacement) settings.    87  770580030  (g) Upon the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice of the commencement of a  Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark  Borrowing or RFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans or RFR  Loans, as applicable, in an Affected Currency to be made, converted or continued during any  Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, (x) the Borrower will be deemed to have  converted any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request for  a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans or (y) any Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR  Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be ineffective.  During any Benchmark  Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available  Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such  Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR.  Furthermore, if any  Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower&#8217;s  receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a  Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a  Benchmark Replacement for such Currency is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.13, (i) if  such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in Dollars, then on the last day of the Interest Period  applicable to such Loan, such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall  constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars on such day or (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan  or RFR Loan is denominated in any Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last  day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower&#8217;s election prior to such day be  prepaid by the Borrower on such day.  SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs.  (a) Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including pursuant to  regulations issued from time to time by the Federal Reserve Board for determining the  maximum reserve requirement (including any emergency, special, supplemental or other  marginal reserve requirement) with respect to eurocurrency funding (currently referred to  as &#8220;Eurocurrency liabilities&#8221; in Regulation D)), compulsory loan, insurance charge, special  deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or credit  extended by, any Lender or any Issuing Bank (except any such reserve requirement  reflected in Adjusted EURIBOR);   (ii) subject any Lender or any Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than (A)  Indemnified Taxes, and (B) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit,  commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital  attributable thereto; or  (iii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market  any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans  made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making,  converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any  such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing    88  770580030  or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by  such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), in each  case by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to be material, then the Borrower  will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such  additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) Capital and Liquidity Requirements.  If any Lender or any Issuing Bank  determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have  the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s capital or on the  capital of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this  Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit held  by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which  such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding company could  have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing  Bank&#8217;s policies and the policies of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding company with  respect to capital adequacy and liquidity requirements), by an amount deemed to be material by  such Lender or such Issuing Bank, then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank,  the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such  additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such  Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s, as applicable, holding company for any such reduction suffered  (provided that, such amounts shall be consistent with amounts that such Lender or Issuing Bank,  as applicable, is generally charging other borrowers similarly situated).  (c) Certificates from Lenders.  A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank  setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculation of the amount or amounts, in  Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the  case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be promptly delivered to the  Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or  such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10  Business Days after receipt thereof.  (d) Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing  Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such  Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower  shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any  increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or  such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to  such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s intention to claim  compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased  costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to  include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any  principal of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor  (including as a result of the occurrence of any Commitment Increase Date or an Event of Default),  (b) the conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period    89  770580030  therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Syndicated Loan on the date  specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (including, in connection with any Commitment  Increase Date, and regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under  Section 2.10(e) and is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment as a result of a  request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(b) of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on  the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate  each affected Lender for such Lender&#8217;s loss (other than loss of profit or spread), cost and  reasonable expense attributable to such event.  Payment under this Section shall be made upon  written request of a Lender delivered not later than ten (10) Business Days following the payment,  conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this  Section accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for  and the calculation of the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to  this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay  such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt  thereof.  SECTION 2.16. Taxes.  (a) Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any  obligation of any Obligor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and  clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law; provided that  if any Obligor shall be required to deduct any Taxes from such payments, then (i) if such Taxes  are Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all  required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this  Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or applicable Issuing Bank (as the case may  be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,  (ii) such Obligor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Obligor shall pay the full amount  deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  In addition, the Borrower shall  pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law,  or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of Other Taxes.  (c) Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall indemnify the  Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank for and, within 10 Business Days after  written demand therefor, pay the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including  Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under  this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may  be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,  whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or  asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, except to the extent that any such Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes arise as the result of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the  Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank.  A certificate as to the amount of such  payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the  Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be  conclusive absent manifest error.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  90  770580030  (d) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the  Administrative Agent, within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for (i) any  Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the  Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and  without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such  Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(f) relating to the maintenance of a  Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that  are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any  reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were  correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as  to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent  shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent  to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan  Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source  against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).  (e) Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of  Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower  shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such  Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or  other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  (f) Tax Documentation.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from  or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located,  or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement  shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times  prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed  and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made  without withholding or at a reduced rate.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or  the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or  reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or  the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup  withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation  (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.16(f)(ii) below) shall not be required if in  the Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such  Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or  commercial position of such Lender.  (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:  (A) any Lender that is a &#8220;United States person&#8221; (as defined under  Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower and the  Administrative Agent (and such additional copies as shall be reasonably requested  by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender become a Lender  under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request  of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed and executed copies    91  770580030  of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any successor form certifying that such  Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; and  (B) each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the  Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the  recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender  under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request  of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), but only if such Foreign Lender is  legally entitled to do so, whichever of the following is applicable:   (w) duly completed and executed copies of Internal Revenue  Service Form W-8BEN-E or any successor form claiming eligibility for  benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,   (x) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W- 8ECI or any successor form certifying that the income receivable pursuant  to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or  business in the United States,   (y) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the  exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (1) a  certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (1) a &#8220;bank&#8221; within  the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a &#8220;10 percent  shareholder&#8221; of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B)  of the Code, or (3) a &#8220;controlled foreign corporation&#8221; described in  Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (2) duly completed and executed  copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (or any successor  form) certifying that the Foreign Lender is not a United States Person, or   (z) any other form including Internal Revenue Service Form W- 8IMY as applicable prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming  exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax duly  completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be  prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the  withholding or deduction required to be made.  (iii)  In addition, each Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the  obsolescence, expiration or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Lender; provided  it is legally able to do so at the time.  Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the  Administrative Agent at any time the chief tax officer of such Lender becomes aware that it no  longer satisfies the legal requirements to provide any previously delivered form or certificate to  the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. or other taxing authorities for  such purpose).  (g) Documentation Required by FATCA.  If a payment made to a Lender under  this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such  Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including    92  770580030  those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall  deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and  at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such  document prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the  Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to  comply with their respective obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and  withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.16(g), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include  any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or  any Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a  refund or credit (in lieu of such refund) of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been  indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts  pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to  the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this  Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing  Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant  Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request  of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid  over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant  Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank in the  event the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund  to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (h), in  no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank be required to pay any  amount to Borrower pursuant to this clause (h), the payment of which would place such Person in  a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have been in if the indemnification  payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This  subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing  Bank to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to  its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  (i) Each party&#8217;s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or  replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a  Lender, the termination of the Commitments, the expiration or cancellation of all Letters of Credit  and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.  SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment: Sharing of Set-offs.  (a) Payments by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall make each payment  required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC  Disbursements, or under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) or under any other Loan  Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York time, on  the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts  received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed  to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest    93  770580030  thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative  Agent&#8217;s Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and  except payments to be made directly to any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender as expressly  provided herein and payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03, which shall be made  directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such  payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly  following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business  Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case  of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All amounts owing under this Agreement  (including commitment fees, payments  required under Section 2.14, and payments required under Section 2.15 relating to any Loan  denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of and interest on any Loan denominated in  any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.15, or any  reimbursement or Cash Collateralization of any LC Exposure denominated in any Foreign  Currency, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except  to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or LC Disbursement when due (whether  at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of  such Loan or LC Disbursement shall, if such Loan or LC Disbursement is not denominated in  Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is  a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest  Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination  and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest  on any Loan or LC Disbursement that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall  automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day  other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an  amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest  shall be payable on demand.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of  any Borrowing in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in  the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the  Borrowing was made (the &#8220;Original Currency&#8221;) no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to  make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original  Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead  be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent (as of the date of  repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes  all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.  (b) Application of Insufficient Payments.  If at any time insufficient funds are  received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,  unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class of Commitments then due hereunder,  such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder,  ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of  such Class then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC  Disbursements of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in  </FONT></DIV>

(c) Pro Rata Treatment.  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) (x)  other than with respect any Syndicated Borrowing requested pursuant to Section 2.21(a)(i), each  Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class of Commitments,  (y) other than the payment of a commitment fee to a Non-Extending Lender on the earlier of the  date its Commitments terminate and its applicable Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date,  each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.11 shall be made for account of the Lenders of  the applicable Class, and (z) other than with respect to any termination or reduction of  Commitments or prepayment of Loans in accordance with Section 2.08(f), each termination or  reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the  respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, in each case pro rata according to the  amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) other than with respect to any  Syndicated Borrowing requested pursuant to Section 2.21(a)(i), each Syndicated Borrowing of a  Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their  respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their  respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of  conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) other than in connection with a termination or  reduction of Commitments or prepayment of Loans in accordance with Section 2.08(f), the  payment of a Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s Non-Extended Loans on such Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s  Non-Extended Final Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.09(a) or a mandatory prepayment  pursuant to Section 2.10(d), each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans of a  Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in  accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Syndicated Loans of such Class  held by them; and (iv) other than the payment of interest to a Non-Extending Lender on the earlier  of the date its Commitments terminate and its applicable Non-Extended Final Maturity Date, each  payment of interest on Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of  the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans of  such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders.  Each Syndicated Borrowing requested  pursuant to Section 2.21(a)(i) shall be made from each Extending Lender and Non-Extending  Lender for which the Non-Extending Commitment Termination Date shall not have occurred on a  pro rata basis according to the amounts of their respective Commitments.  Any termination or  reduction of Commitments or prepayment of Loans made in accordance with Section 2.08(f)  (including any payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans in connection therewith),  shall be applied to the applicable Non-Extending Lender(s) on a pro rata basis according to the  amounts of their respective Commitments or Loans, as applicable, any payment of Non-Extended  Loans on a Non-Extended Final Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.09(a) shall be made for the  account of each Non-Extending Lender for which the applicable Non-Extended Final Maturity  Date shall have occurred pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of  the Non-Extended Loans held by them and any mandatory prepayment of Non-Extended Loans  pursuant to Section 2.10(d) shall be made for account of each Non-Extending Lender for which  the applicable Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date shall have occurred pro rata in  accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Non-Extended Loans held by them.

If any Lender of any Class of  Commitment shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment  in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans, or participations in LC  Disbursements or Swingline Loans, of such Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a  greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC  Disbursements and Swingline Loans, and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the  proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater  proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans, and  participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of other Lenders of such Class to the  extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such  Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their  respective Syndicated Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, of  such Class; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the  payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase  price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this  paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and  in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as  consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations  in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary  or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower  consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law,  that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise  against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully  as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  (e) Presumptions of Payment.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have  received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the  Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower  will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made  such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,  distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event,  if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks,  as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the  amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from  and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the  Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.  (f) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent.  If any Lender shall fail to  make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.04(d), 2.05(e),  2.06(a) or (b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any  contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for  account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender&#8217;s obligations under such Sections until all such  unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.    96  770580030  SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests  compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to  any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,  then, at the request of the Borrower, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a  different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and  obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if in the judgment of such  Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant  to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to  any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be  disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and  expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  (b) Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation under  Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any  Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, and, in each case,  such Lender has not designated a different lending office in accordance with clause (a) above, or  if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or is a Non-Consenting Lender (as provided in Section  9.02(d)), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the  Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance  with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and  obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee  may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall  have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being  assigned, each Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably  be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding  principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued  interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to  the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case  of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for  compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such  assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be  required to make any such assignment and delegation if prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by  such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and  delegation cease to apply.  SECTION 2.19. Defaulting Lenders.  (a) Defaulting Lender Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as  such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:  (i) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or  other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender  (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) or  received by Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.08 shall    97  770580030  be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows:  first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative  Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such  Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash  Collateralize each Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting  Lender in the manner described in Section 2.05(d); fourth, as Borrower may request (so  long as no Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such  Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as  determined by Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by Administrative Agent and  Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such  Defaulting Lender&#8217;s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this  Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank&#8217;s future Fronting Exposure with  respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this  Agreement, in the manner described in Section 2.05(d); sixth, to the payment of any  amounts owing to the Lenders, Issuing Banks or Swingline Lender as a result of any  judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank  or any Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting  Lender&#8217;s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Event of  Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any  judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such  Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s breach of its obligations under  this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court  of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal  amount of any Loans or reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement for  which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such  Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions  set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied and waived, such payment shall be applied solely  to pay the Loans of, and reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement that  is owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the  payment of any Loans of, or reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement  that is owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and  unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders  pro rata in accordance with the applicable Commitments without giving effect to Section  2.19(a)(iii). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting  Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post  Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.19(a)(i) shall be deemed paid to and redirected  by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (ii) Certain Fees.  (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee pursuant  to Sections 2.11(a) and (b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting  Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise  would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender); provided  that such Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive fees pursuant to Section  2.11(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to  extent allocable to its Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Percentage, as  </FONT></DIV>

(B) With respect to any Section 2.11(b) fees not required to be paid to  any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each  Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such  Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation in Letters  of Credit or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting  Lender pursuant to clause (iii) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Bank the amount of  any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to  such Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be  required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  (iii) Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part  of such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall  be reallocated (effective no later than one (1) Business Day after the Administrative Agent  has actual knowledge that such Lender has become a Defaulting Lender) among the Non- Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Dollar Percentages and  Applicable Multicurrency Percentages, as the case may be (in each case calculated without  regard to such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Commitment), but only to the extent that (x) the  conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless  Borrower shall have otherwise notified Administrative Agent at such time, Borrower shall  be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such  time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure  of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Commitment. No  reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party  hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a  Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such  Non-Defaulting Lender&#8217;s increased exposure following such reallocation.  (iv) Cash Collateral; Repayment of Swingline Loans. If the reallocation  described in clause (iii) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall  not later than two (2) Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the  direction of any Issuing Bank and/or any Swingline Lender), without prejudice to any right  or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an  amount equal to the Swingline Lender&#8217;s Swingline Exposure (which exposure shall be  deemed equal to the applicable Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the total  outstanding Swingline Exposure (other than Swingline Exposure as to which such  Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation obligation has been reallocated to other Lenders or Cash  Collateralized in accordance with the terms hereof)) and (y) second, Cash Collateralize  each Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in  Section 2.19(d) or (z) make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the  Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lenders in their sole discretion  to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender.  (v) Amendments Etc.  No Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or  disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder or any other Loan Documents    99  770580030  and the Credit Exposure and unused Commitments of such Defaulting Lender shall not be  included in determining whether two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Lenders, two-thirds (2/3rds) of  the Lenders of a Class, the Required Lenders or the Required Lenders of a Class have taken  or may take any action hereunder or any other Loan Documents, except that the  Commitments of such Lender may not be increased or extended, and, except as otherwise  set forth herein, amounts payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder may not be  permanently reduced, without the consent of such Defaulting Lender (other than reductions  in fees and interest in which such reduction does not disproportionately affect such  Defaulting Lender).  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the  Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting  Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date  specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include  arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that such former Defaulting Lender will, to the  extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take  such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and  funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata  by the Lenders in accordance with the applicable Commitments (without giving effect to Section  2.19(a)(iii)), and if Cash Collateral has been posted with respect to such Defaulting Lender, the  Administrative Agent will promptly return or release such Cash Collateral to the Borrower,  whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will  be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower  while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent  otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender  to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that  Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.  (c) New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a  Defaulting Lender, (i) no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless  it is satisfied that the participations therein will be fully allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders  in a manner consistent with clause (a)(iii) above and the Defaulting Lender shall not participate  therein and (ii) no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of  Credit unless it is satisfied that the participations in any existing Letters of Credit as well as the  new, extended, renewed or increased Letter of Credit has been or will be fully allocated among the  Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (a)(iii) above and such Defaulting  Lender shall not participate therein except to the extent such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s participation has  been or will be fully Cash Collateralized in accordance with Section 2.19(d).  (d) Cash Collateral. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender,  promptly following the written request of Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank (with a copy  to Administrative Agent) Borrower shall Cash Collateralize each Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting  Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section  2.19(a)(iii) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less  than the Minimum Collateral Amount in respect of such Fronting Exposure.    100  770580030  (i) Grant of Security Interest. Borrower, and to the extent provided by any  Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control  of) Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Issuing Banks, and agrees to maintain, a first  priority security interest (subject only to Liens of the type described in clause (g) of the  definition of Permitted Liens and unrecorded Liens permitted hereunder which have  priority over the Liens on the Collateral by operation of law) in all such Cash Collateral as  security for the Defaulting Lenders&#8217; obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters  of Credit, to be applied pursuant to clause (ii) below. If at any time Administrative Agent  determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than  Administrative Agent and Issuing Banks as herein provided (subject only to Liens of the  type described in clause (g) of the definition of Permitted Liens), or that the total amount  of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount in respect of such  Fronting Exposure, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay  or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to  eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the  Defaulting Lender).  All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds  subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at  SMBC.  Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all reasonable and  customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in  connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral.  (ii) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.19 in respect of Letters of Credit  shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s obligation to fund  participations in respect of Letters of Credit (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by  a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral  was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be  provided for herein.  (iii) Termination of Requirement. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion  thereof) provided to reduce Issuing Bank&#8217;s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required  to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.19 following (i) the elimination of  the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status  of the applicable Lender) or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent and Issuing  Banks that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to the other provisions  of this Section 2.19, the Person providing Cash Collateral and each Issuing Bank may agree  that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure;  provided, further, that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by Borrower,  such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the  Loan Documents.  SECTION 2.20. Assignment and Reallocation of Existing Commitments and  Existing Loans.    (a) On the Restatement Effective Date, the Lenders, shall assign and transfer  the Loans among themselves, in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that, after  giving effect to all such assignments and transfers, the Loans of each Class are held ratably by the    101  770580030  Lenders of such Class in accordance with the respective Commitments of such Class of such  Lenders (immediately after giving effect to this Agreement).  Concurrently therewith, the Lenders  of each Class shall be deemed to have assigned and transferred their participation interests in any  outstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans of such Class among themselves, in a manner  acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that such interests are held ratably in accordance with  the Commitments of such Class of such Lenders (immediately after giving effect to this  Agreement).  (b) Each of the Lenders hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) no Lender nor  the Administrative Agent has made any representations or warranties or assumed any  responsibility with respect to (A) any statements, warranties or representations made in or in  connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness or  sufficiency of this Agreement, the Existing Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or (B)  the financial condition of any Obligor or the performance by any Obligor of its obligations  hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (ii) it has received such information as it has deemed  appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement; and (iii) it  has made and continues to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this  Agreement, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other  Lender.  SECTION 2.21. Reallocation Following a Non-Extended Commitment  Termination Date.  (a) Reallocation of Participations and Loans.  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) in connection with the  reduction or termination of any Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s Commitments in accordance with  Section 2.08(f) on any date prior to the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date for  such Non-Extending Lender, the Borrower shall be permitted to request a Loan to be made  ratably among the Extending Lenders and Non-Extending Lenders for which the Non- Extended Commitment Termination Date shall not have occurred who are in the same  Class of Commitment as such Non-Extending Lender in accordance with the provisions of  Sections 2.02, 2.03 and 2.17(c) in an amount up to the amount by which such Non- Extending Lender&#8217;s Revolving Dollar Credit Exposure or Revolving Multicurrency Credit  Exposure, as applicable, would otherwise exceed such Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s  Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as applicable, of  the Dollar Credit Exposure or Multicurrency Credit Exposure, as applicable, after giving  effect to such Commitment reduction or termination and (b) on any date following the Non- Extended Commitment Termination Date for any Non-Extending Lender until the  Extended Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower shall be permitted to request a  Loan to be made ratably among the Extending Lenders and Non-Extending Lenders for  which the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date shall not have occurred who are  in the same Class of Commitment as such Non-Extending Lender in accordance with  Sections 2.02, 2.03 and 2.17(c) in an amount up to the Revolving Credit Exposure of each  Non-Extending Lender for which the Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date shall  have occurred, in each case of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), so long as (x) the  conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied (and, unless Borrower shall have otherwise  </FONT></DIV>

The Borrower will, and will cause each  of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, including the Investment Company  Act, and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property, except where the  failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a  Material Adverse Effect.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will, and  will cause its Subsidiaries to, conduct its business and other activities in compliance in all material  respects with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and any applicable rules, regulations  or orders issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower  may elect to cause any of its Financing Subsidiaries, Immaterial Subsidiaries or Foreign  Subsidiaries to become an Obligor by causing such Person to become a Subsidiary Guarantor and  executing and delivering a Guarantee Assumption Agreement (and, if requested by the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent with respect to any Foreign Subsidiaries, executing  and delivering a guarantee and security agreement governed by the laws of the country in which  such Subsidiary is located, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative  Agent and the Collateral Agent, it being understood that a guarantee and security agreement that  is substantially in the form of the Guarantee and Security Agreement, other than with respect to  modifications to reflect requirements under the laws of the country in which such Subsidiary is  located, will be deemed reasonably acceptable) and other deliverables as required for a Subsidiary  Guarantor under this Section 5.08(a) (at which point such Person shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor  and shall no longer be an Immaterial Subsidiary).  (b) Ownership of Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.12. Portfolio Valuation and Diversification Etc.  (a) Industry Classification Groups.  For purposes of this Agreement, the  Borrower shall assign each Portfolio Investment to an Industry Classification Group.  To the extent  that any Portfolio Investment is not correlated with the risks of other Portfolio Investments in an  Industry Classification Group, such Portfolio Investment may be assigned by the Borrower to an  Industry Classification Group that is more closely correlated to such Portfolio Investment.  In the  absence of any correlation, the Borrower shall be permitted, upon prior notice to the  Administrative Agent and each Lender, to create up to three additional industry classification  groups for purposes of this Agreement.  (b) Portfolio Valuation Etc.  (i) Settlement Date Basis.  For purposes of this Agreement, all determinations  of whether an investment is to be included as a Portfolio Investment shall be determined  on a settlement-date basis (meaning that any investment that has been purchased will not  be treated as a Portfolio Investment until such purchase has settled, and any Portfolio  Investment which has been sold will not be excluded as a Portfolio Investment until such  sale has settled); provided that no such investment shall be included as a Portfolio  Investment to the extent it has not been paid for in full.  (ii) Determination of Values.  The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value  to be assigned to each of its Portfolio Investments as follows:    120  770580030  (A) Quoted Investments - External Review.  With respect to Portfolio  Investments (including Cash Equivalents) for which market quotations are readily  available, the Borrower shall, not less frequently than once each calendar week,  determine the market value of such Portfolio Investments which shall, in each case,  be determined in accordance with one of the following methodologies (as selected  by the Borrower):  (w) in the case of public and 144A securities, the average of the  bid prices as determined by two Approved Dealers selected by the  Borrower,  (x) in the case of Bank Loans, the bid price as determined by  one Approved Dealer selected by the Borrower,  (y) in the case of any Quoted Investment traded on an exchange,  the closing price for such Quoted Investment most recently posted on such  exchange, and  (z) in the case of any other Quoted Investment, the fair market  value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service.  (B) Unquoted Investments- External Review.  With respect to each  Portfolio Investment for which market quotations are not readily available, the  Borrower shall, in accordance with its Valuation Policy, determine the fair market  value of such Portfolio Investment.  (C) Internal Review.  The Borrower shall conduct internal reviews of all  Portfolio Investments at least once each calendar week which shall take into  account any events of which the Borrower has knowledge that materially and  adversely affect the aggregate value of the Portfolio Investments.  If the value of  any Portfolio Investment as most recently determined by the Borrower pursuant to  this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) is lower than the value of such Portfolio Investment as  most recently determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A) and (B), such lower  value shall be deemed to be the &#8220;Value&#8221; of such Portfolio Investment for purposes  hereof; provided that the Value of any Portfolio Investment of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries shall be increased by the net unrealized gain as at the date such Value  is determined of any Hedging Agreement entered into to hedge risks associated  with such Portfolio Investment and reduced by the net unrealized loss as at such  date of any such Hedging Agreement (such net unrealized gain or net unrealized  loss, on any date, to be equal to the aggregate amount receivable or payable under  the related Hedging Agreement if the same were terminated on such date).  (D) Failure to Determine Values.  If the Borrower shall fail to (x)  determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to the  requirements of the foregoing sub-clause (A), (B) or (C), then the &#8220;Value&#8221; of such  Portfolio Investment as at such date shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of the    121  770580030  Borrowing Base until such time as the value of such Portfolio Investment is  otherwise determined or reviewed, as applicable, in accordance herewith.  (E) Testing of Values.    (x)  For the second calendar month immediately following the  end of each fiscal quarter (the last day of such calendar month, the  &#8220;Valuation Testing Date&#8221;, and the last such fiscal quarter, the &#8220;Testing  Period&#8221;), the Administrative Agent shall cause an Approved Third-Party  Appraiser selected by the Administrative Agent to value such number of  Unquoted Investments (selected by the Administrative Agent) that  collectively have an aggregate Value approximately equal to the  Calculation Amount; provided, that, unless an Event of Default has  occurred and is continuing, such Unquoted Investments selected by the  Administrative Agent shall be Investments that are included in the  Borrowing Base.  The Administrative Agent agrees to notify the Borrower  in writing of the Unquoted Investments selected by the Administrative  Agent to be tested in each Testing Period, not later than 15 days prior to the  Valuation Testing Date (or such later date as agreed to between the  Administrative Agent and the Borrower).

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  122  770580030  (F) Valuation Dispute Resolution.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  Administrative Agent shall at any time have the right to request, in its reasonable  discretion, any Unquoted Investment included in the Borrowing Base with a value  determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) (other than, so long as no Event of  Default exists, any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base tested  pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(E) as of the most recent Testing Period) to be  independently valued by an Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected by the  Administrative Agent.  There shall be no limit on the number of such appraisals  requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided that,  (i) any appraisal shall be conducted in a manner that is not disruptive to the  Borrower&#8217;s business and (ii) the values determined by any appraisal shall be treated  as confidential information by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall  be deemed to be &#8220;Information&#8221; hereunder and subject to Section 9.13 hereof.  The  reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of any such valuation shall be at  the expense of the Borrower; provided that, so long as no Event of Default has  occurred and is continuing, the Borrower&#8217;s obligations to reimburse valuation costs  incurred by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(F) shall  be limited to an aggregate annual amount equal to the greater of $100,000 and  0.015% of the aggregate Commitments.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the  Borrower of its receipt of results from an Approved Third-Party Appraiser of any  appraisal and provide a copy of the results and any related reports to the Borrower.   If the difference between the Borrower&#8217;s valuation pursuant to Section  5.12(b)(ii)(B) and the valuation of any Approved Third-Party Appraiser selected  by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(E) or (F) and such  difference is (1) less than 5% of the Borrower&#8217;s value thereof, then the Borrower&#8217;s  valuation shall be used, (2) between 5% and 20% of the Borrower&#8217;s value thereof,  then the valuation of such Portfolio Investment shall be the average of the value  determined by the Borrower and the value determined by the Approved Third-Party  Appraiser retained by the Administrative Agent and (3) greater than 20% of the  Borrower&#8217;s value thereof, then the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall  select an additional Approved Third-Party Appraiser and the valuation of such  Portfolio Investment shall be the average of the three valuations (with the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s Approved Third-Party Appraiser&#8217;s valuation to be used  until the third valuation is obtained).  For the avoidance of doubt, Portfolio  Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the Borrowing Base  as of the most recent Testing Period shall not be subject to testing under this Section  5.12(b)(ii)(F).   (iii) Generally Applicable Valuation Provisions.  (A) Each Approved Third-Party Appraiser (whether selected by the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent) shall apply a recognized valuation  methodology that is commonly accepted in the Borrower&#8217;s industry for valuing  Portfolio Investments of the type being valued and held by the Obligors.  Other  procedures relating to the valuation will be reasonably agreed upon by the  Administrative Agent and the Borrower.    123  770580030  (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from the  Restatement Effective Date until the date when the first valuation report with  respect to the applicable Portfolio Investment is required to be delivered under  Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) or (E), as applicable, the Value of any Portfolio Investment  included in the Borrowing Base shall be the Value as delivered to the  Administrative Agent on or prior to the Restatement Effective Date. For the  avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) the value of any Portfolio  Investments determined in accordance with any provision of this Section 5.12 shall  be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a  new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently required to be determined  in good faith in accordance with this Section 5.12.  (C) The foregoing valuation procedures shall only be required to be used  for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base and shall not be required to be  utilized by the Borrower for any other purposes, including, without limitation, the  delivery of financial statements or valuations required under ASC820 or the  Investment Company Act or otherwise.  (D) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt of  the final results of any such test promptly upon its receipt thereof and shall provide  a copy of such results and the related report to the Borrower promptly upon the  Borrower&#8217;s request.  (E) The Administrative Agent and each Lender acknowledges that it  may be required to enter into a non-reliance letter, confidentiality agreement or  similar agreement requested or required by a proposed appraiser to allow the  Administrative Agent or such Lender to review any written valuation report.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, there shall be no  requirement to disclose any portion of any report submitted by an Approved Third- Party Appraiser without such a non-reliance letter if such non-reliance letter is  required by such Approved Third-Party Appraiser as a condition to such disclosure.  (c) RIC Diversification Requirements.  The Borrower will, to the extent  applicable, comply with the portfolio diversification requirements set forth in the Code applicable  to RIC&#8217;s at each time such diversification requirements are subject to testing pursuant to the Code,  subject in each case to applicable grace periods set forth in the Code.  (d) Participation Interests.  The Value attributable to any Participation Interest  shall be the Value determined with respect to the underlying portfolio investment related to such  Participation Interest in accordance with this Section 5.12, provided any participation interest that  does not satisfy the definition of Participation Interest shall have a Value of zero (0) for purposes  of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any Obligor be permitted to  prepay or settle (whether as a result of a mandatory redemption, conversion or otherwise) any such  Indebtedness if, immediately after giving effect thereto and any concurrent acquisitions of  Portfolio Investments or payment of outstanding Loans or Other Covered Indebtedness, the  Covered Debt Amount would exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect.  SECTION 6.13. Accounting Changes.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit  any of its Subsidiaries to, make any change in (a) accounting policies or reporting practices, except  as permitted under GAAP or required by law or rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority,  or (b) its fiscal year.

The Administrative Agent  shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other  Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent  shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has  occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any  discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers  expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is  required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein  and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose,  and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any  of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent  or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action  taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other  number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan  Documents) or in the absence of its own fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The  Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until  written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the  Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into  (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any  other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered  hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or  observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or  therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other  Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any  condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of  items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  SECTION 8.04. Reliance.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely  upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,  statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or  intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed  or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made  to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur  any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who  may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and  shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such  counsel, accountants or experts.  SECTION 8.05. Sub-Agents.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and  all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed  by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any  and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The  exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the  Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their  respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein  as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible  for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent    147  770580030  jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted  with fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.  SECTION 8.06. Resignation; Successor Administrative Agent.  The  Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the  Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent  of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (or, if an Event of Default has occurred  and is continuing in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall  have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within  30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring  Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1) the retiring  Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the  Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and  communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be  made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor  agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as  Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become  vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative  Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations  hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees  payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable  to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall  continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while  it was acting as Administrative Agent.  Any resignation by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation as Administrative Agent  pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as an Issuing Bank and a Swingline  Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor&#8217;s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a)  such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and  duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank and  Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder  or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit  in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make  other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations  of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.  SECTION 8.07. Reliance by Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,  independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based  on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and  decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently  and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such  documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its  own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan  Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  The  Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis,  to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender    148  770580030  with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before  the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and the Administrative Agent shall have  no responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided  to Lenders.  Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement or any Assignment and  Assumption and funding any Loan shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and  consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be approved  by the Administrative Agent, Required Lenders or Lenders.  SECTION 8.08. Modifications to Loan Documents.  Except as otherwise  provided in Section 2.13 or Section 9.02(b) or (c) of this Agreement or the Security Documents  with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the  Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under  any of the Loan Documents; provided that, without the prior consent of each Lender, the  Administrative Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in the Security Documents) release  all or substantially all of the Collateral or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens  under any Security Document providing for collateral security, agree to additional obligations  being secured by all or substantially all of such collateral security (excluding (x) any such increase  pursuant to a Commitment Increase under Section 2.08(e), (y) any Secured Longer-Term  Indebtedness or Secured Shorter-Term Indebtedness permitted hereunder or (z) the spreading of  such Liens to any Designated Indebtedness Obligations or Hedging Agreement Obligations (as  such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement)), or alter the relative priorities  of the obligations entitled to the benefits of the Liens created under the Security Documents with  respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral, except that no such consent shall be required,  and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower), to direct the  Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement, subject to any applicable  requirements under Section 10.03 of the Guarantee and Security Agreement, to release any Lien  covering property in accordance with Section 9.02(c) hereof.  SECTION 8.09. Erroneous Payments.

(ii) Certain Conditions to Assignments.  Assignments shall be subject to the  following additional conditions:  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a  Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender&#8217;s    160  770580030  Commitment or Loans and LC Exposure of a Class, the amount of the Commitment  or Loans and LC Exposure of such Class of the assigning Lender subject to each  such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with  respect to such Assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be  less than U.S. $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be  required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has  occurred and is continuing;  (B) each partial assignment of any Class of Commitments or Loans and  LC Exposure shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the  assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of such  Class of Commitments, Loans and LC Exposure;  (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the  Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing  and recordation fee of U.S. $3,500 (which fee shall not be payable in connection  with an assignment to a Lender or to an Affiliate of a Lender), for which the  Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not be obligated;   (D) the assignee, if it shall not already be a Lender of the applicable  Class, shall deliver to (x) the Administrative Agent an Administrative  Questionnaire;  (E) the assignee shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent those documents specified in Section 2.16(f); and  (F) any assignment by a Multicurrency Lender shall (unless the  Borrower otherwise consents in writing) be made only to an assignee that has  agreed to make Revolving Loans pursuant to its Multicurrency Commitment and is  able to fund and receive payments in the Agreed Foreign Currencies for which  Revolving Loans may be made at the time of such proposed assignments without  the need to obtain any authorization referred to in clause (c) of the definition of  &#8220;Agreed Foreign Currency&#8221;.  (iii) Effectiveness of Assignments.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof  pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each  Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the  extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and  obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,  to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from  its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption  covering all of the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such  Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of  Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior  to the effective date of such assignment).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights  or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be    161  770580030  treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such  rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section (but only to the  extent such assignment or other transfer otherwise complies with the provisions of such  paragraph).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with any  assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such  assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions set forth  in Section 9.04(b)(ii) or otherwise, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional  payments to Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution  thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of  participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with  the consent of Borrower and Administrative Agent, the Applicable Percentage of Loans  previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the  applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full  all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent, each  Issuing Bank, each Swingline Lender and each Lender hereunder (and interest accrued  thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Applicable Percentage of all  Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting  Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with  the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a  Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  The  Administrative Agent agrees to provide the Borrower with official copies of the Register  upon reasonable request.  (c) Maintenance of Registers by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative  Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of  its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a  register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,  and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each  Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#8220;Registers&#8221; and each individually, a  &#8220;Register&#8221;).  The entries in the Registers shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the  Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person  whose name is recorded in the Registers pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all  purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Registers shall be  available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time  and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (d) Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent.  Upon its receipt of  a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee,  the assignee&#8217;s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a  Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section  and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the  Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information  contained therein in the Register.  No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement  unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  162  770580030  (e) Special Purposes Vehicles.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained herein, any Lender (a &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle  (an &#8220;SPC&#8221;) owned or administered by such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from  time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to  provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to  make; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any  SPC, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part  of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, make such Loan  pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) the rights of any such SPC shall be derivative of the rights of the  Granting Lender, and such SPC shall be subject to all of the restrictions upon the Granting Lender  herein contained, and (iv) no SPC shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14 (or any other  increased costs protection provision), 2.15 or 2.16.  Each SPC shall be conclusively presumed to  have made arrangements with its Granting Lender for the exercise of voting and other rights  hereunder in a manner which is acceptable to the SPC, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and  the Borrower, and each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Obligors shall be entitled  to rely upon and deal solely with the Granting Lender with respect to Loans made by or through  its SPC.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting  Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of  this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all  outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person  in instituting against, such SPC, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or  liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State  thereof, in respect of claims arising out of this Agreement; provided that the Granting Lender for  each SPC hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss,  cost, damage and expense arising out of their inability to institute any such proceeding against its  SPC.  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPC  may (i) without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and  without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to  its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or  for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if  any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans (but nothing contained herein shall be construed in  derogation of the obligation of the Granting Lender to make Loans hereunder); provided that  neither the consent of the SPC or of any such assignee shall be required for amendments or waivers  hereunder except for those amendments or waivers for which the consent of participants is required  under paragraph (1) below, and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis (in the same manner described  in Section 9.13(b)) any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency,  commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to  such SPC.  (f) Participations.  Any Lender may, with the consent of the Borrower (such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), sell participations to one or more banks or  other entities (other than any Defaulting Lender, any Disqualified Institution or any natural persons  (or a holding company, investments vehicle, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated  by or for the primary benefit of a natural Person)) (a &#8220;Participant&#8221;) in all or a portion of such  Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including    163  770580030  all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to it); provided  that, (i) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate  of a Lender or so long as an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has  occurred and is continuing, (ii) such Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents shall remain unchanged, (iii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other  parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative  Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such  Lender in connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other  Loan Documents.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a  participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement  and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any  provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, such agreement or  instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to  any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that  affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section 9.04, the Borrower agrees that  each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16, subject to the  requirements and limitations therein, to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its  interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04; provided that, such  Participant agrees that it (i) shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.18 as if it were an  assignee and (ii) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or  2.16, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to  receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change  in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation; provided, further,  that no Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified  of the participation granted to such Participant and such Participant shall have complied with the  requirements of Section 2.16 as if such Participant is a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a  participation agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate  with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.18(b) with respect to any Participant.   To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08  as though it were a Lender; provided that, such Participant agrees to be subject to  Section 2.17(d) as though it were a Lender hereunder.  So long no Event of Default under clause  (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, all Participants (other than any  Participant that is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender) must execute a Lender NDA, with such  changes as requested by such Participant as may be approved by the Borrower (such approval not  to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), prior to such Participant&#8217;s receipt of any confidential  information of the Borrower. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this  purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name  and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant&#8217;s  interest in the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or other obligations under the Loan  Documents (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;)); provided that, no Lender shall have any obligation to  disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or  any other information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of  Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any person except to the extent that  such disclosures are necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other  obligation is in registered form under Section 163 of the Code and any related United States  Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest    164  770580030  error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register  as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice  to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as  Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (g) Limitations on Rights of Participants.  A Participant shall not be entitled to  receive any greater payment under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would  have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the  sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent.  A  Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits  of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and  such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with paragraphs (e) and (f) of  Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender and in the case of a Participant claiming exemption for  portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, the applicable Lender shall provide  the Borrower with satisfactory evidence that the participation is in registered form and shall permit  the Borrower to review such register as reasonably needed for the Borrower to comply with its  obligations under applicable laws and regulations.  (h) Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security  interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender,  including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank  having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or  assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest  shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for  such Lender as a party hereto; provided, further, that if any confidential information of the  Borrower is to be provided to such pledgee or assignee (in each case, other than a Federal Reserve  Bank or any other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender) and so long no Event of  Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, such  pledgee or assignee must first execute a Lender NDA, with such changes as requested by such  pledgee or assignee as may be reasonably approved by the Borrower, prior to its receipt of any  such confidential information.  (i) Further Limitations on Assignments.  Anything in this Section to the  contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Loan or LC  Exposure held by it hereunder (i) to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without  the prior consent of each Lender, or (ii) to any &#8220;business development company&#8221; under the  Investment Company Act or any subsidiary thereof or to any private equity fund or person whose  primary business is the management of private equity funds (including mezzanine investment  funds) excluding any commercial or investment bank (including any commercial or investment  bank that sponsors private equity funds or makes private equity investments or mezzanine or other  loans), provided that any mezzanine investment fund sponsored by a commercial bank shall not  be a permitted assignee or participant under this Section 9.04.  SECTION 9.05. Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations and  warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in  connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the  other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making    165  770580030  of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any  such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing  Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation  or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect  as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount  payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and  so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.14,  2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of  the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the  expiration or termination, Cash Collateralization or backstop of the Letters of Credit and the  Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  Any Non-Extending  Lender that has had all of its obligations under this Agreement and each other Loan Document  paid in full shall cease to be a Lender under the Loan Documents following the earliest to occur  of (i) such Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s Non-Extended Commitment Termination Date, (ii) the  termination of such Non-Extending Lender&#8217;s Commitment in its entirety pursuant to Section  2.08(f) and (iii) the Termination Date, except with respect to any provision applicable to such Non- Extending Lender that expressly survives the termination of a Loan Document.  SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.  (a) Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed  in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall  constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This  Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative  Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter  hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating  to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become  effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the  Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear  the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to  the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Delivery of  an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy or electronically (e.g.  pdf) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.  (b) Electronic Execution of Loan Documents.  The words &#8220;execution,&#8221;  &#8220;signed,&#8221; &#8220;signature,&#8221; and words of like import in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents  including any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or  electronic records, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a  manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may  be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic  Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and  Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  SECTION 9.07. Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be  invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to  the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality  </FONT></DIV>

The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to  other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.  Each  Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff  and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such  setoff and application.  SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.  (a) Governing Law.  This Agreement and, unless otherwise specified therein,  each other Loan Document and any claims, controversy, dispute, or cause of action (whether based  in contract, tort, or otherwise and whether at law or in equity) based upon, arising out of, or relating  to this Agreement, such other Loan Document and any transactions contemplated hereby and  thereby shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

Each party to this Agreement (i) irrevocably consents  to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 and (ii) agrees that service  as provided in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 is sufficient to confer personal  jurisdiction over such party in any proceeding in any court and otherwise constitutes effective and  binding service in every respect. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to  this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.  SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO  HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,  ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,  ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY  (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY  HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY  OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH  OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE  FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES  HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG  OTHER THINGS.  THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.  SECTION 9.11. Judgment Currency.  This is an international loan transaction in  which the specification of Dollars or any Foreign Currency, as the case may be (the &#8220;Specified  Currency&#8221;), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case  may be (the &#8220;Specified Place&#8221;), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency  of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency.  The payment  obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged or satisfied by an amount  paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the  extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified  Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the  Specified Place due hereunder.  If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary  to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the &#8220;Second  Currency&#8221;), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be the rate at which in accordance with  normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with  the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is  rendered.  The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the  Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in this  Section called an &#8220;Entitled Person&#8221;) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied  in rendering such judgment be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following  receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the Second Currency  such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to    168  770580030  the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged  to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such  judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on  demand, in the Specified Currency.  the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such  Entitled Person in the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency  so purchased and transferred.  SECTION 9.12. Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of  Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and  shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.  SECTION 9.13. Treatment of Certain Information; No Fiduciary Duty;  Confidentiality.  (a) Treatment of Certain Information.  The Borrower acknowledges that from  time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided  to the Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries (in connection with this Agreement or  otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of such Lender and the  Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by the  Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of  such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate, it being understood  that any such subsidiary or affiliate receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions  of paragraph (b) of this Section as if it were a Lender hereunder.  Such authorization shall survive  the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the  Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  Each Lender shall  use all information delivered to such Lender by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this  Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, in  connection with providing services to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and  their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;), may have  economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their  stockholders and/or their affiliates. The Borrower, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries,  agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory,  fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one  hand, and the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other.  The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries each acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions  contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder  and thereunder) are arm&#8217;s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand,  and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the  process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor  of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their stockholders or affiliates with respect to the  transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the  process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or  will advise the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their stockholders or their affiliates on other  matters) or any other obligation to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries except the obligations  expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and  not as the agent or fiduciary of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, their management,  stockholders, creditors or any other Person. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries each    169  770580030  acknowledge and agree that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it  deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with  respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. The Borrower and each of its  Subsidiaries each agree that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any  nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, in  connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.  (b) Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the  Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information  (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its Affiliates and to its and its  Affiliates&#8217; respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other  representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and  related matters (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be  informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information  confidential), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction  over it (including any self-regulatory authority), (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or  regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party hereto, (v) in  connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any  action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement  of rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially  the same as those of this Section, to (x) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective  assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (y) any actual  or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the  Borrower and its obligations, (vii) with the written consent of the Borrower, (viii) to the extent  such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or  (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any of their  respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower and is not  actually known by it to be in breach of any other Person&#8217;s confidentiality obligations to the  Borrower, (ix) on a confidential basis to (x) any rating agency in connection with rating the  Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (y) the CUSIP Service  Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers  with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder or (x) or to the extent required by a potential  or actual insurer or reinsurer in connection with providing insurance, reinsurance or credit risk  mitigation coverage under which payments are to be made or may be made by reference to this  Agreement.  In addition, the Administrative Agent and each Lender may disclose the existence of  this Agreement and information about this Agreement to the extent such information is publicly  available to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service  providers to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the administration or  servicing of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments.  For the avoidance  of doubt, nothing herein prohibits any individual from communicating or disclosing information  to a governmental, regulatory, or self-regulatory authority (any such entity, a &#8220;Regulatory  Authority&#8221;) without any notification to any person to the extent any such prohibition on disclosure  set forth herein shall be prohibited by the laws or regulations applicable to such Regulatory  Authority.  For purposes of this Section, &#8220;Information&#8221; means all information received from or  on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its  </FONT></DIV>

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided  in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has  exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such  Person would accord to its own confidential information.  SECTION 9.14. USA PATRIOT Act.  Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower  that pursuant to the requirements of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain,  verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and each other Obligor and each  beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, which information includes the name and address of the  Borrower, each other Obligor and each beneficiary of a Letter of Credit and other information that  will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower, each other Obligor and each beneficiary of a  Letter of Credit in accordance with said Act.  SECTION 9.15. Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs.  To the  extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedging  Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support &#8220;QFC Credit  Support&#8221; and each such QFC a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows  with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution  Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below  applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated  to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state  of the United States):  In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;)  becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such  Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or  under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such  Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the  same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the  Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in  property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the  event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding  under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might  otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against  such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights  could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan  Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without  limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with  respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect  to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.    171  770580030  SECTION 9.16. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial  Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other  agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges  that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the  extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the  applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be  bound by:   (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the  applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to  it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and  (b) the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if  applicable:  (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other  instruments of ownership in such Affected  Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or  a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares  or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect  to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of  the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.  SECTION 9.17. Interest Rate Limitations.  Notwithstanding anything herein to  the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges  and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively  the &#8220;Charges&#8221;), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the &#8220;Maximum Rate&#8221;) which may be  contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance  with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with  all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent  lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were  not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and  Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not  above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at  the applicable Overnight Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, if Administrative  Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess  interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal,  refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received  by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the  extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense,  fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof,  and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest  throughout the contemplated term of the obligations hereunder.    172  770580030  SECTION 9.18. Effect of Amendment and Restatement of the Existing Credit  Agreement.  On the Restatement Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended  and restated in its entirety by this Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a)  this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, whether executed and delivered in connection  herewith or otherwise, do not constitute a novation or termination of the obligations for principal,  interest or fees of the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement as in effect on the Effective  Date immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Agreement and which remain outstanding; and  (b) except for any of the Borrower&#8217;s obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement which are  expressly contemplated to be repaid on the Restatement Effective Date and to the extent are in fact  so repaid, the obligations of the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement (as amended and  restated hereby and which are on and after the date hereof subject to the terms herein) are in all  respects continuing, and shall continue to be secured as provided in the Security Documents.  SECTION 9.19. Representations and Warranties of the Lenders.  Each Lender  represents and warrants that in participating as a Lender, it is engaged in making, acquiring or  holding commercial loans and in providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to  such Lender, in each case in the ordinary course of business, and not for the purpose of investing  in the general performance or operations of the Borrower, or for the purpose of purchasing,  acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument such as a security (and each Lender  agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing, such as a claim under the federal or  state securities laws).  SECTION 9.20. Lender Information Reporting.  The Administrative Agent shall  use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Borrower not later than one Business Day  after the last day of each calendar month, a notice summarizing in reasonable detail the amount of  interest, fees and (if any) other expenses under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents  accrued for the month then ended (and noting amounts paid/unpaid); provided that, the failure of  the Administrative Agent to deliver this report shall not excuse the Borrower from paying interest,  fees and (if any) other expenses in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan  Documents.  SECTION 9.21. German Bank Separation Act.  Solely for so long as Deutsche  Bank AG New York Branch, or any Affiliate thereof, is a Lender, if any such Lender is subject to  the GBSA (any such Lender, a &#8220;GBSA Lender&#8221;) and such GBSA Lender shall have determined in  good faith (based on reasonable advice and a written opinion of counsel), which determination  shall be made in consultation with the Borrower subject to the terms hereof that, due to the  implementation of the German Act on the Ring-fencing of Risks and for the Recovery and  Resolution Planning for Credit Institutions and Financial Groups (Gesetz zur Abschirmung von  Risiken und zur Planung der Sanierung und Abwicklung von Kreditinstituten und Finanzgruppen)  of 7 August 2013 (commonly referred to as the German Bank Separation Act (Trennbankengesetz)  (the &#8220;GBSA&#8221;)), whether before or after the date hereof, or any corresponding European legislation  (such as the proposed regulation on structural measures improving the resilience of European  Union credit institutions) that may amend or replace the GBSA in the future or any regulation  thereunder, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in the interpretation by, any court, tribunal  or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of the GBSA or any corresponding future  European legislation that may amend or replace the GBSA in the future or any regulation  thereunder, the arrangements contemplated by this Agreement or the Loans have, or will, become    173  770580030  illegal, prohibited or otherwise unlawful, then, and in any such event, such GBSA Lender shall  give written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such determination (which  written notice shall include a reasonably detailed explanation of such illegality, prohibition or  unlawfulness, including, without limitation, all evidence and calculations used in the determination  thereof, a &#8220;GBSA Initial Notice&#8221;), whereupon until the tenth Business Day after the date of such  GBSA Initial Notice, such GBSA Lender shall use best efforts to transfer to the extent permitted  under applicable law such arrangements, Commitments and/or Loans to an Affiliate or other third  party in accordance with Section 9.04. If no such transfer is effected in accordance with the  preceding sentence, such GBSA Lender shall give written notice thereof to the Borrower and the  Administrative Agent (a &#8220;GBSA Final Notice&#8221;), whereupon (i) all of the obligations (including  outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans,  accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, collectively,  the &#8220;GBSA Obligations&#8221;) owed to such GBSA Lender hereunder and under the Loans shall  become due and payable, and the Borrower shall repay the GBSA Obligations, on the tenth  Business Day immediately after the date of such GBSA Final Notice (such date being the &#8220;Initial  GBSA Termination Date&#8221;) and, for the avoidance of doubt, such repayment shall not be subject to  the terms and conditions of Section 2.08, 2.10, 2.15, 2.17(c) or 2.17(d) to the extent that there are  no outstanding amounts due and payable to the other Lenders at such date and (ii) the  Commitments of such GBSA Lender shall terminate on the Initial GBSA Termination Date;  provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to such Initial GBSA Termination Date and in  the event the Borrower in good faith reasonably believes there is a mistake, error or omission in  the grounds used to determine such illegality, prohibition or unlawfulness under the GBSA or any  corresponding future European legislation that may amend or replace the GBSA in the future or  any regulation thereunder, then the Borrower may provide written notice (which written notice  shall include a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis of such good faith belief, including,  without limitation, all evidence and calculations used in the determination thereof, a &#8220;GBSA  Consultation Notice&#8221;) to that effect, at which point the GBSA Obligations owed to such GBSA  Lender hereunder and under the Loans shall not become due and payable, and the Commitments  of such GBSA Lender shall not terminate, until the Business Day immediately following the tenth  Business Day immediately after the Initial GBSA Termination Date (and the period from, and  including, the date of the GBSA Consultation Notice until the tenth Business Day immediately  thereafter being the &#8220;GBSA Consultation Period&#8221;).  In the event the Borrower and such GBSA  Lender cannot in good faith reasonably agree during the GBSA Consultation Period whether the  arrangements contemplated by this Agreement or the Loans have, or will, become illegal,  prohibited or otherwise unlawful under the GBSA or any corresponding future European  legislation that may amend or replace the GBSA in the future or any regulation thereunder, then  all of the GBSA Obligations owed to such GBSA Lender hereunder and under the Loans shall  become due and payable, and the Commitments of such GBSA Lender shall terminate, on the  Business Day immediately following the last day of such GBSA Consultation Period.  For the  avoidance of doubt, so long as a GBSA Consultation Period has occurred and is continuing, (i) the  Commitments and Revolving Credit Exposure of any GBSA Lender shall be subject to Section  2.18, and the Borrower shall have all rights to replace such GBSA Lender in accordance with  Section 2.18(b), (ii) no GBSA Lender shall be required to fund its pro rata share of any Borrowing  or acquire participations in any Swingline Loans under Section 2.04(d) or Letters of Credit under  Section 2.05(e), (iii) each GBSA Lender shall be deemed to have an Applicable Percentage,  Applicable Dollar Percentage and Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of zero for purposes of  </FONT></DIV>

NEW MOUNTAIN FINANCE CORPORATION  By    Name:  Title:        6  For Term Benchmark Borrowings only.  Other Interest Periods to be inserted with agreement by all  relevant Lenders.       770580030  EXHIBIT D    [Form of Lender NDA]    CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT    This Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of _________, 20__ (this  &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) is made and entered into between ___________________ (&#8220;Recipient&#8221;) and New  Mountain Finance Corporation (with its affiliates, &#8220;NMFC&#8221;) (collectively, the &#8220;Parties&#8221;).    NMFC has provided or may provide to Recipient and Recipient&#8217;s Representatives (as  defined below) for their review in conjunction with evaluating, preparing for or maintaining a  potential or ongoing business relationship with NMFC (the &#8220;Relationship&#8221;), certain highly  confidential, non-public and proprietary information regarding NMFC and its existing or potential  businesses, which information may include, without limitation, financial statements, projections,  budgets, current or prospective business plans; investment or trading strategies (including past  performance of such strategies and any examples of such strategies), methods and models;  investment documents; risk management systems; institutional or organizational structures;  financial records and performance data; internal processes and procedures; operational data;  compliance materials and reports; personnel information or other non-public data relating to  employees, officers, principals, owners, investors, prime brokers or counterparties; trade secrets;  prospective projects; information relating to any actual or prospective legal matters (including  litigation, regulatory, industry self-regulatory or compliance matters) that may be subject to  privilege; information regarding companies in which NMFC has invested or disclosed by those  companies to Recipient at NMFC&#8217;s direction; and any other non-public information relating to  NMFC that is or has been revealed to Recipient by or on behalf of NMFC at any time in preparation  for or evaluation of the Relationship (&#8220;Confidential Information&#8221;). If the Recipient is a  governmental entity, or advising a governmental entity, the Confidential Information is being  provided voluntarily and contains trade secret and confidential business or financial information  exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and its state equivalents, and  notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein Recipient hereby agrees not to disclose  any Confidential Information pursuant thereto. Confidential Information shall include (i) all  disclosures made at any time by or on behalf of NMFC to Recipient, whether made orally, in  writing, or by any other means whether tangible, intangible, electronic or observational; (ii) all  analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, memoranda or other documents prepared by Recipient  or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on Confidential Information, even if  such documents do not identify NMFC by name; and (iii) the fact that Recipient has received  information hereunder or is considering the possibility of entering, or has entered into, the  Relationship. All Confidential Information, except that described in clause (ii) above, is and shall  remain the property of NMFC. By disclosing Confidential Information to Recipient, NMFC does  not grant to Recipient any license, interest or rights of any kind in or to the Confidential  Information. Recipient agrees that the disclosure of Confidential Information to Recipient does not  confer upon Recipient any rights in or to the Confidential Information. No representation or  warranty is made herein concerning the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information       770580030  or the suitability of the Confidential Information for Recipient&#8217;s purposes. &#8220;Representatives&#8221;  shall mean Recipient&#8217;s officers, directors, employees, accountants and attorneys.     Recipient and its Representatives shall not, without first obtaining NMFC&#8217;s express written  consent: (a) use or permit the use of any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever  except for the specific purposes of evaluating, preparing for and performing the Relationship; (b)  disclose or permit the disclosure of any Confidential Information to any person or entity other than  to those of the Recipient&#8217;s Representatives with a need to know the information contained therein  for the purposes of the Relationship, provided that each such Representative has undertaken to  hold such Confidential Information confidential to the same (or substantially similar) extent set  forth herein; and (c) disclose any Confidential Information to any other client or affiliate of  Recipient or any competitor or potential competitor of NMFC. Recipient agrees to maintain all  Confidential Information in strict confidence at all times. Recipient shall be responsible for any  breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.    This Agreement shall not apply to particular portions of the Confidential Information that  (i) are or become generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure in breach  of this Agreement; or (ii) are in, or come into, Recipient&#8217;s possession on a nonconfidential basis  from a third party source that is entitled to make such disclosure without breaching any obligation  of confidentiality to NMFC. If Recipient is required by law, regulatory authority or by court order,  subpoena, or other legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient may do so,  provided that it has first given NMFC prompt written notice (unless such notice is prohibited by  law) so that NMFC may object to such disclosure and/or seek an appropriate protective order, and  further provided that Recipient limits its disclosure to the minimum information necessary to  comply with the final order.    Recipient acknowledges that improper disclosure of NMFC&#8217;s Confidential Information  may irreparably harm NMFC. Because money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any  breach of this Agreement, NMFC shall be entitled to seek and obtain specific performance and  injunctive or other equitable relief on an emergency, temporary, preliminary and/or permanent  basis, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, without first being required to  demonstrate actual damages or post any security or bond. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be  the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other legal,  equitable or contractual remedies that NMFC may have.    Recipient acknowledges that some Confidential Information may constitute material non- public information and agrees to comply with all laws, including securities laws, concerning such  information.    Recipient agrees that absent NMFC&#8217;s prior written approval it will not name or show  NMFC as a client, business partner, or otherwise, in any advertising or marketing materials or  other text, audio, visual or electronic media for public distribution. Promptly upon the request of  NMFC, Recipient shall (except as required by law) return to NMFC or destroy all originals and  copies of any Confidential Information in its or its Representatives&#8217; possession or control, and       770580030  provide written confirmation of such return or destruction to NMFC. If Recipient is required by  applicable law or regulation to retain any Confidential Information beyond the date upon which it  would otherwise be required hereunder to return or destroy such Confidential Information, then  notwithstanding the paragraph below, the terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply to all  such Confidential Information for as long as it is retained by Recipient.    This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) two years from the  date hereof and (ii) the date on which the Recipient or one of its affiliates executes definitive  financing documentation in connection with the Relationship containing a confidentiality  undertaking by the Recipient or such affiliate, except as otherwise provided herein.    This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the internal laws of the State of New  York (without reference to choice of law doctrine). This Agreement may be executed in several  counterparts, each of which, when taken together, shall be deemed the same agreement. Each  individual signing this Agreement on behalf of each respective party represents that he or she has  the authority to bind such party hereby. This Agreement may not be changed or modified except  by written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their successors in interest. The provisions of  this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof are held by a court  of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining  provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement may  not be assigned by either party without prior written agreement of the other party, such consent  not to be unreasonably withheld.     Please sign and return a copy of this Agreement to evidence your acceptance of and agreement to  the foregoing terms.    Sincerely,    New Mountain Finance Corporation    By: _______________________  Name:  Title:    ACCEPTED AND AGREED:    [NAME OF RECIPIENT]    By: ________________________  Name:  Title:    Date: _______________________    </FONT></DIV>
