Multicurrency Letters of Credit will be issued on a serial basis by each Primary Issuing Bank, in each case, at the direction of the Administrative Agent, with (i) such issuance to result in the Primary Issuing Banks sharing (to the extent reasonably practicable) ratably in the aggregate exposure with respect to Multicurrency Letters of Credit and (ii) the Multicurrency Letter of Credit exposure of each Primary Issuing Bank to be subject to an individual sub-limit, the Dollar Equivalent of which shall be $10,000,000 for RBC and $5,000,000 for JPM, or in either case, such other amounts from time to time as otherwise mutually agreed to by each such Primary Issuing Bank and the Lead Borrower.  For the avoidance of doubt, Existing Multi-Currency Letters of Credit of a Primary Issuing Bank shall count towards such Primary Issuing Bank&#8217;s individual sub-limit. (iii) The Lead Borrower shall identify in the request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit under which of the Multicurrency Revolving Facility or the Dollar Revolving Facility such Letter of Credit shall be issued; provided that Letters of Credit denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars may only be requested to be issued under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Letters of -92- #96942867v160458181 #96942867v1 </FONT></DIV>

(ii) Any such deposit under clause (i) above shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (j).  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account, and the Lead Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a First Priority security interest in the LC Collateral Account.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Lead Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders) be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations.  If the Lead Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (together with all interest and other earnings with respect thereto, to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Lead Borrower promptly but in no event later than three Business Days after such Event of Default has been cured or waived. -100- #96942867v160458181 #96942867v1 </FONT></DIV>

The Lead Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Lead Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Lead Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.18(c) and will, in each case, notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any payment received by a Lender in its capacity as an Ancillary Lender at any time prior to service of notice under Section 7.01 or, if applicable, such time as the remedies provided thereunder automatically come into effect, if, after giving effect to the provisions of Section 7.01, an Ancillary Lender is subject to sharing obligations under this Section 2.18, such obligations shall not apply to any payment received by such Ancillary Lender to the extent that such payment is applied to reduce the Gross Outstandings under the applicable Ancillary Facility to the net limit on which such Ancillary Facility is provided.

In such event, if the Lead Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. (e) If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or Section 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender&#8217;s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Loan Guaranty; it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the other Loan Documents may be exercised solely by, the Administrative Agent, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or in the event of any other Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), (A) the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such Disposition and (B) the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such Disposition. No holder of any Secured Hedging Obligation, Banking Services Obligation or Ancillary Obligation in its respective capacity as such shall have any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under this Agreement. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Hedge Agreement with respect to any Secured Hedging Obligation, by entering into documentation in connection with any Banking Services Obligation and/or by entering into any Ancillary Documents in connection with any Ancillary Obligation, each of the other Secured Parties hereby authorizes and shall be deemed to authorize) the Administrative Agent, on behalf of all Secured Parties to take any of the following actions upon the instruction of the Required Lenders: (a) consent to the Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral free and clear of the Liens securing the Secured Obligations in connection with any Disposition pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 thereof; (b) credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in -204- #96942867v160458181 #96942867v1 </FONT></DIV>

Each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to credit bid any part of the Secured Obligations or to purchase or retain or acquire any portion of the Collateral; provided that, in connection with any credit bid or purchase described under clause (b), (c) or (d) of the preceding paragraph, the Secured Obligations owed to all of the Secured Parties (other than with respect to contingent or unliquidated liabilities as set forth in the next succeeding paragraph) may be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent on a ratable basis.

In the event that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects not to estimate any such contingent or unliquidated claim or any such claim cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of the Administrative Agent to consummate any credit bid or purchase in accordance with the second preceding paragraph, then any contingent or unliquidated claims not so estimated shall be disregarded, shall not be credit bid, and shall not be entitled to any interest in the portion or the entirety of the Collateral purchased by means of such credit bid.

To the extent permitted by law, any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
