the Administrative Agent deems necessary or desirable to (a) preserve or protect Collateral or any portion thereof or (b) to enhance the

such revocation, the Administrative Agent&rsquo;s determination that funding of a Protective Advance is appropriate shall be conclusive.
The Administrative Agent may request the Term Loan Lenders to make a Loan to repay a Protective Advance. At any other time, the Administrative

Term Loan Lender&rsquo;s purchased interest and participation promptly when requested to the Administrative Agent, to such account of
the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may designate, but in any case not later than 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day notified
(if notice is provided by the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 p.m. and otherwise on the immediately following Business Day (the &ldquo;<U>Transfer
Date</U>&rdquo;)). Transfers may occur during the existence of a Default or Event of Default. Such amounts transferred to the Administrative
Agent shall be applied against the amount of the applicable Protective Advance and shall constitute Loans of such Term Loan Lenders, respectively.
If any such amount is not transferred to the Administrative Agent by any Term Loan Lender on such Transfer Date, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Term Loan Lender together with interest thereon for each day from the date
such payment was due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate for three (3) Business Days
and thereafter at the Base Rate. From and after the date, if any, on which any Term Loan Lender is required to fund, and funds, its interest

Lender, such Term Loan Lender&rsquo;s Ratable Share of all payments of principal and interest and all proceeds of Collateral received
by the Administrative Agent in respect of such Protective Advance.</P>

Lender shall forfeit any other rights or remedies, including the right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or other Person,
whether because of any applicable Laws pertaining to &ldquo;election of remedies&rdquo; or otherwise, each Borrower consents to such action
and waives any claim of forfeiture of such rights or remedies based upon it, even if the action may result in loss of any rights of subrogation
that such Borrower might otherwise have had. Any election of remedies that results in denial or impairment of the right of the Administrative
Agent or any Term Loan Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower&rsquo;s obligation
to pay the full amount of the Obligations. Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies, such as
nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any security for the Obligations, even though that election of remedies destroys such Borrower&rsquo;s
rights of subrogation against any other Person. The Administrative Agent may bid all or a portion of the Obligations at any foreclosure
or trustee&rsquo;s sale or at any private sale, and the amount of such bid need not be paid by the Administrative Agent but shall be credited
against the Obligations. The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether the Administrative Agent or any other Person is the
successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral, and the difference between such bid amount
and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.15</U>,
notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to
which the Administrative Agent or any Term Loan Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.</P>

so credit bid) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to
consummate such purchase). Upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower Agent at any time, the Secured Parties will confirm
in writing the Administrative Agent&rsquo;s authority to release any such Liens on particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to

Agent Indemnitee Liabilities were incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), or against any
Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent). The obligations of the Term Loan
Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of <U>Section 2.12(d)</U>. In no event shall any Term Loan Lender
have any obligation hereunder to indemnify or hold harmless an Agent Indemnitee with respect to any Agent Indemnitee Liabilities

willful misconduct of such Agent Indemnitee. In the Administrative Agent&rsquo;s discretion, it may reserve for any Agent Indemnitee
Liabilities of an Agent Indemnitee, and may satisfy any judgment, order or settlement relating thereto, from proceeds of Collateral
prior to making any distribution of Collateral proceeds to the Secured Parties. If the Administrative Agent is sued by any creditor
representative, debtor-in-possession or other Person for any alleged preference or fraudulent transfer, then any monies paid by the
Administrative Agent in settlement or satisfaction of such proceeding, together with all interest, costs and expenses (including
attorneys&rsquo; fees) incurred in the defense of same, shall be promptly reimbursed to the Administrative Agent by each Term Loan
Lender to the extent of its Ratable Share thereof.</P>

admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon Holdings and each Subsidiary Guarantor, and conclusive for
the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guarantied Obligations. This guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity,
