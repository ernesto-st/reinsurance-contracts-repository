all taxes, assessments, standby fees, homeowners' or condominium association

assessed against any of the Mortgaged Property by any governmental authority or
any other person, before the Impositions become delinquent, and Mortgagor will
provide receipts of all Impositions payments to Mortgagee promptly upon request.

                  Section 2.2. Insurance. Mortgagor will keep the Mortgaged
Property insured against loss by fire, storm, gas explosion (if gas is used on
the Mortgaged Property) and all other hazards contemplated by a standard
all-risk extended coverage endorsement for an amount at least equal to the full
insurable value (replacement cost) of the Improvements, and also insured against
any other risks, including flood, mudslide and where required by Mortgagee,
windstorm, in such amounts and with such endorsements and other terms as
Mortgagee requires from time to time The casualty policy will also cover loss of
rents from the Mortgaged Property for the time that the Mortgaged Property is
unavailable due to any casualty. If the Mortgaged Property is presently located
in or is later determined to be in a "special flood hazard area" as set out in
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 or the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973, as amended by the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each may
be amended, or any successor law (the "ACTS"), Mortgagor agrees to purchase a
flood insurance policy in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the full
insurable value of the Improvements and (b) the maximum limit of coverage
available for the Mortgaged Property under the Acts in form complying with the
"insurance purchase requirement" of the Acts, and provide Mortgagee with
evidence of such coverage. Mortgagor will additionally maintain liability
insurance and worker's compensation insurance against claims for bodily injury,
death or property damage on or around the Mortgaged Property in such amounts and
with such endorsements and other terms acceptable to Mortgagee. Mortgagor will
provide such other additional insurance as Mortgagee may require from time to
time. All required insurance policies must (i) be issued by companies reasonably
acceptable to Mortgagee, (ii) name the owner of the Mortgaged Property as either
the named insured on the policy or as an additional named insured on an
endorsement to the policy; (iii) be indorsed to be payable to Mortgagee as
mortgagee insured and loss payee, and (iv) expressly prohibit cancellation or
modification without 10 days written notice to Mortgagee. Mortgagor will
promptly deliver to Mortgagee the original policies of all required insurance or
other evidence of such insurance acceptable to Mortgagee.

                  Section 2.3. Maintenance of Property. Mortgagor will maintain
the Mortgaged Property in good condition. If the Mortgaged Property is damaged
by any cause, Mortgagor will promptly restore the Mortgaged Property to
substantially its condition prior to such damage. Mortgagor will not allow any
part of the Mortgaged Property to be torn down, removed or materially altered
without Mortgagee's prior written consent.

                  Section 2.4. Title to Property. Mortgagor will warrant and
defend Trustee's title to and Mortgagee's security interest in the Mortgaged
Property against any person who claims any of it. No person owns any lien or
other interest in the Mortgaged Property except the lien and security interest
created by this Deed of Trust, other liens and security interests for the
benefit of Mortgagee, Permitted Encumbrances and the statutory lien for taxes
not yet due. No person other than Mortgagee owns any interest in the Rents. No
lien document or financing statement affecting any Mortgaged Property or the
Rents, other than lien documents and financing statements in favor of Mortgagee
and Permitted Encumbrances, is on file in any public office. If any person
claims any interest or encumbrance, except for Permitted Encumbrances, Mortgagor
will promptly remove any such adverse claim, lien or encumbrance from the
Mortgaged Property or the Rents. Mortgagor will give Mortgagee prompt notice

legal proceeding affecting, any part of the Mortgaged Property or the Rents.

Rents. This paragraph will survive termination or foreclosure of this Deed of
Trust.

                  Section 2.5. Books and Records. Mortgagor will maintain
accurate and complete books and other records regarding the Mortgaged Property,
including finances, leases and the physical condition of the Mortgaged Property.

accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, as set forth in Opinions
of the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accounts and/or in statements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and/or
their respective successors and which are applicable as of the date in
question..

                  Section 2.6. Inspection. Upon two (2) Business Day's (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) prior notice to Mortgagor, Mortgagor will (i)
during normal business hours permit representatives of Mortgagee to go upon,
examine and inspect the Mortgaged Property, including making appraisals and
environmental assessments, (ii) furnish all information Mortgagee reasonably
requests relating to the development and operation of the Mortgaged Property,
(iii) permit Mortgagee to make copies of such information and (iv) permit
Mortgagee to perform environmental assessments of the Mortgaged Property and in
connection therewith to take away samples of air, building materials, soil and
water. When an Event of Default exists, the prior notice described in the first
sentence of this clause (f) shall not be required. The representatives of any
Bank may accompany Mortgagee during any examination, visit, inspection or
discussions under this clause (f).

                  Section 2.7. Indemnity. Mortgagor shall, at its sole cost and
expense, protect, defend, indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified

relating to any one or more of the following: (i) ownership of this Deed of
Trust, the Mortgaged Property or any interest therein or receipt of any Rents;

and/or any member, partner, joint venturer or shareholder thereof becoming a
party to a voluntary or involuntary federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or

the transaction in connection with which this Deed of Trust is made; (viii) any
failure of the Mortgaged Property or any use



DEED OF TRUST, ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 4



<PAGE>

thereof to be in compliance with any Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 5
hereof); (ix) the enforcement by any Indemnified Party of the provisions of this
Section 2(g); (x) any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be
asserted against Mortgagee or any Bank by reason of any alleged obligations or
undertakings on its part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants, or
agreements contained in any Lease; (xi) the payment of any commission, charge or
brokerage fee to anyone which may be payable in connection with the funding of
the Debt evidenced by the Notes and secured by this Deed of Trust or any other
Debt; (xii) any misrepresentation made by Mortgagor in this Deed of Trust or any
other Loan Document; or (n) THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PARTY. Any amounts payable to Mortgagee by reason of the application
of this Section 2(g) shall become immediately due and payable upon demand and
shall bear interest at the rate provided in the Notes for past due amounts from
the date of demand to the date of payment. For purposes of this Section 2(g),
the term "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES" means Mortgagee, the Banks and any person or
entity who is or will have been involved in the origination of the Debt, any
person or entity who is or will have been involved in the servicing of the Debt,
any person or entity in whose name the encumbrances and security interests
created by this Deed of Trust is or will have been recorded, persons and
entities who may hold or acquire or will have held a full or partial interest in
the Debt as well as the respective directors, officers, shareholders, partners,
members, employees, agents, servants, representatives, contractors,
subcontractors, affiliates, subsidiaries, participants, successors and assigns
of any and all of the foregoing (including but not limited to any other person
or entity who holds or acquires or will have held a participation or other full
or partial interest in the Debt or the Mortgaged Property, whether during the
term of the loan evidenced by the Notes or as a part of or following a
foreclosure of this Deed of Trust and including, but not limited to, any
successors by merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or a substantial
portion of Mortgagee's and the Banks' assets and business). This paragraph will
survive the termination or foreclosure of this Deed of Trust.

                  Section 2.8. Mortgagee's Rights. If Mortgagor fails to perform
any obligation under this Deed of Trust, Mortgagee may perform, but Mortgagee's
performance will not waive Mortgagor's default. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, if at any time Mortgagee is not in receipt of written evidence
that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Mortgagee
shall have the right, without notice to Mortgagor, Borrower or any other party
to take such action as Mortgagee deems necessary to protect its interest in the
Mortgaged Property, including without limitation, the obtaining of such
insurance coverage as Mortgagee in its sole discretion deems appropriate. If
Mortgagee secures required insurance, Mortgagee may secure the insurance only in
its own name and may insure only its interest in the Mortgaged Property.

                  Section 2.9. Mortgagor's Location and Name. The address set
forth in Section 17 of this Deed of Trust is: (i) Mortgagor's chief executive
office, if Mortgagor is not an individual and has more than one place of
business; or (ii) Mortgagor's place of business if Mortgagor is not an
individual and has only one place of business. If Mortgagor is a registered
organization, it is organized under the laws of the state or foreign
jurisdiction set forth under Mortgagor's certification below. If Mortgagor is a
registered organization, Mortgagor's name as set forth above in this Deed of
Trust is its correct name as indicated on the public record of Mortgagor's
jurisdiction of organization which shows Mortgagor to have been organized. If
Mortgagor uses any trade or assumed names, Mortgagor has properly filed of
record in the appropriate filing offices all those trade names and has delivered
to Mortgagee a list of all of Mortgagor's assumed or trade names. Mortgagor will
promptly notify Mortgagee of any change in Mortgagor's location, name, identity,
organizational structure or jurisdiction of organization.

         ARTICLE III. Collection and Application of Insurance and Condemnation
Proceeds. Mortgagor assigns to Mortgagee all amounts received by Mortgagor or
Mortgagee as proceeds of insurance and



DEED OF TRUST, ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 5


<PAGE>

proceeds of condemnation proceedings as additional security for the Debt.
Mortgagor will promptly give Mortgagee notice of any material damage to or
condemnation proceeding affecting the Mortgaged Property. Mortgagee may file or
prosecute (or both) any insurance or condemnation claim. Mortgagee may collect
and give receipts for any money payable under any insurance policy by reason of
loss of or damage to the Improvements. Mortgagee may settle or compromise, on
any terms and for any amount it selects, the liability of any insurance company
or companies on any policy, and execute and deliver releases and discharges of
liability binding Mortgagor and Mortgagee. Mortgagee may collect and give
receipts for any money payable to Mortgagor because of condemnation proceedings
affecting any Mortgaged Property. Mortgagor RELEASES Mortgagee and the Banks
from any liability in connection with any settlement or compromise of any
insurance or condemnation claim. Mortgagee may apply all insurance or
condemnation proceeds, first to Mortgagee's expenses in connection with the
insurance or condemnation claim, and second, at Mortgagee's discretion, either
(i) to the Debt in any order Mortgagee selects, or (ii) to the repair or
improvement of the Mortgaged Property in any manner Mortgagee selects, applying
the remaining money to the Debt in any order Mortgagee selects.

         ARTICLE IV. Environmental Matters.

                  Section 4.1. Definitions.

                           (I) "ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENT" means any statute,
                  common law rule, rule, regulation, order, authorization
                  (including any permit) or policy of any governmental authority
                  relating to the environment, pollution, natural resources,
                  health or safety, including the federal Clean Air Act,
                  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
                  Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), Water Pollution Control Act,

                  Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Texas Water Code
                  and Texas Health & Safety Code, as each of such statutes and
                  codes has been amended to date and may be amended from time to
                  time.

                           (II) "HAZARDOUS MATERIAL" means any material, waste
                  or substance that is regulated, considered or identified as
                  hazardous or toxic or as a pollutant or contaminant under any
                  Environmental Requirement, including any "hazardous substance"
                  under CERCLA, "solid waste" or "hazardous waste" under RCRA,
                  petroleum, petroleum product, asbestos, polychlorinated
                  biphenyls and radioactive materials.

                           (III) "ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM" means any governmental or
                  private claim or action pursuant to any Environmental
                  Requirement instituted or threatened against Mortgagor or
                  relating to the Mortgaged Property, including any
                  investigative, enforcement, cleanup, removal, containment or
                  remedial action.

                  Section 4.2. Representation and Agreement. Mortgagor has
conducted all customary or appropriate due diligence review of the Mortgaged
Property relating to Environmental Requirements



DEED OF TRUST, ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 6



<PAGE>

and Hazardous Materials. Mortgagor will comply with all Environmental
Requirements. Mortgagor will keep the Mortgaged Property free of all Hazardous
Materials and will not permit any Hazardous Materials to be placed (in a storage
tank or otherwise), installed, disposed of or released on the Mortgaged
Property. If Mortgagor ever becomes aware that any Hazardous Material is located
on, in, above or under the Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor will at Mortgagor's
cost promptly remove all such Hazardous Materials in accordance with
Environmental Requirements. Mortgagor will promptly notify Mortgagee if it
becomes aware of any violation of the provisions of this paragraph or if any
person or governmental entity notifies Mortgagor of any Environmental Claim.

                  Section 4.3. Indemnity. Mortgagor will indemnify Mortgagee and
the Banks and hold Mortgagee and the Banks harmless against all liability, loss,
cost or expense of any kind directly or indirectly relating to any Environmental
Claim relating to the Mortgaged Property, any Environmental Requirement
affecting the Mortgaged Property, and the presence of Hazardous Materials on the
Mortgaged Property (whether or not the placement of the Hazardous Materials on
the Mortgaged Property was within the control of Mortgagor or any affiliate).
This paragraph will survive termination or foreclosure of this Deed of Trust.

         ARTICLE V. Compliance with Laws. Mortgagor shall promptly comply with
all existing and future federal, state and local laws, orders, ordinances,
governmental rules and regulations or court orders affecting or which may be
interpreted to affect the Mortgaged Property, or the use thereof ("APPLICABLE
LAWS"). Mortgagor shall from time to time, upon Mortgagee's request, provide
Mortgagee with evidence satisfactory to Mortgagee that the Mortgaged Property
and the use thereof comply with all Applicable Laws or are exempt from
compliance with Applicable Laws. Mortgagor shall give prompt notice to Mortgagee
of the receipt by Mortgagor of any notice related to a violation of any
Applicable Laws and of the commencement of any proceedings or investigations
which relate to compliance with Applicable Laws.

         ARTICLE VI. Advances and Attorneys' Fees. Mortgagor will pay, or
reimburse Mortgagee for, all costs and expenses of every character incurred from
time to time in connection with this Deed of Trust and the Debt, including costs
and expenses incurred (a) for mortgage or recording taxes, (b) to satisfy any
obligation of Mortgagor under this Deed of Trust or to protect the Mortgaged
Property, (c) in connection with the evaluation, monitoring or administration of
the Debt or the Mortgaged Property (whether or not an Event of Default has
occurred), and (d) in connection with the exercise of Mortgagee's rights and
remedies. Costs and expenses include reasonable fees and expenses of outside
counsel and other outside professionals and charges imposed for the services of
attorneys and other professionals employed by Mortgagee or its affiliates. Any
amount owing under this Section will be due and payable on demand and will bear
interest from the date of expenditure by Mortgagee until paid at the rate
provided in the Notes for past due principal.

         ARTICLE VII. Events of Default; Acceleration; Appointment of Receiver.
Each of the following events is called an "EVENT OF DEFAULT":

                  Section 7.1. Any "Event of Default," as defined in the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document, occurs;

                  Section 7.2. Mortgagor fails to comply with or becomes subject
to any administrative or judicial proceeding under any federal, state or local
hazardous waste or environmental law, asset forfeiture or similar law which may
result in the forfeiture of property, or other law where non-



DEED OF TRUST, ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 7



<PAGE>

compliance may have a significant effect on the Mortgaged Property or on
Mortgagor's ability to pay any Debt;

                  Section 7.3. Mortgagee reasonably believes that there is a
defect in Mortgagor's title to any of the Mortgaged Property, or any person
(including Mortgagor) alleges that (i) a lien or encumbrance exists on any
Mortgaged Property equal or superior to the lien of this Deed of Trust, other
than Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii) the lien of this Deed of Trust is subject
to a homestead claim or other claim, and in any such case Mortgagor fails,
within 15 days after written demand by Mortgagee, to correct such title defect
or to remove said lien, encumbrance, homestead claim or other claim, or a writ
of execution is levied against the interest of Mortgagor in the Mortgaged
Property; or

                  Section 7.4. Mortgagor sells, transfers, pledges, encumbers,
grants a security interest in, or otherwise disposes of all or any part of or
interest in the Land or the Improvements (including the granting of any
easement), or if the title to all or any of the Mortgaged Property (other than
items of personalty that have become obsolete or worn beyond practical use and
that have been replaced by adequate substitutes owned by Mortgagor and having a
value equal to or greater than the replaced items when new) becomes vested in
any party other than Mortgagor, whether by operation of law or otherwise.
Mortgagee may consent to any action under this paragraph in its discretion, and
if it consents it may impose any requirements for consent that it wishes.

         If any Event of Default occurs, Mortgagee may, without demand,
presentment or notice of any kind (including notice of default, notice of intent
to accelerate the maturity of the Debt, or notice of actual acceleration), all
of which Mortgagor waives, declare all of the Debt immediately due and payable,
and may request that Trustee exercise any of Trustee's remedies under this Deed
of Trust. In addition, if an Event of Default occurs, Trustee will be entitled
as a matter of right to the appointment of a receiver or receivers of the
Mortgaged Property, and of all its rent and other income. Notwithstanding the
appointment of any receiver, Trustee will be entitled to the possession and
control of any cash or instruments that this Deed of Trust requires Mortgagor to
deliver or pay to Trustee. If an Event of Default occurs, Mortgagee may demand
that Mortgagor surrender possession of the Mortgaged Property to Mortgagee. If
Mortgagee takes possession of the Mortgaged Property, neither Mortgagee nor any
Bank will be liable to Mortgagor for any rental of the Mortgaged Property, nor
for any failure to rent or inadequacy of rental of the Mortgaged Property, nor
for any damage to or waste of the Mortgaged Property, WHETHER OR NOT DUE TO
MORTGAGEE'S OR ANY BANK'S NEGLIGENCE, except as a result of the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of Mortgagee or such Bank.

         ARTICLE VIII. Terms of Assignment of Rents; Collection and Application
of Rents. The transfer and assignment of the Rents provided for in this Deed of
Trust is irrevocable. Mortgagee grants to Mortgagor a limited license (the
"LICENSE") to possess and use the Leases and the Rents. If an Event of Default
occurs, the License will automatically terminate. Thereafter, Mortgagee will
have the absolute and continuing right (but not the obligation) to collect,
demand, sue for, recover, receive and give receipts for any Rent. Neither
Mortgagee nor any Bank has any responsibility to exercise diligence in
collecting Rents. After deducting the expenses of collection, Mortgagee will
apply the net proceeds of collection as a credit upon any portion of the Debt
selected by Mortgagee, whether or not that portion of the Debt is due and
payable. Mortgagor authorizes and directs any lessee of the Mortgaged Property
to deliver any such payment to Mortgagee, and any lessee's obligation to
Mortgagor will be absolutely discharged to the extent of its payment to
Mortgagee. If Mortgagor receives any Rents after the termination of Mortgagor's
license, Mortgagor will hold the Rents in trust for Mortgagee and immediately
pay them to Mortgagee. Mortgagor will keep Rents segregated from all other
funds. Mortgagee is not required to give any credit against the Debt for the
assignment of rents until rents are actually paid to Mortgagee. Mortgagor's



DEED OF TRUST, ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 8


<PAGE>

obligations to Mortgagee will be discharged only to the extent that net Rents
are received by Mortgagee and not disbursed to Mortgagor or paid by Mortgagee
for expenses relating to the Land and Improvements. The assignment of rents will
not cause Mortgagee to be a mortgagee-in-possession. If the License is
terminated, Mortgagee's possession of the Rents will not act as a waiver of any
default by Mortgagor or as an affirmance of any Lease by Mortgagee or any Bank
if Mortgagee or any Bank later becomes the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property
at any foreclosure sale. Mortgagee may at its option subordinate the lien of
this Deed of Trust to any Lease. The assignment of rents will terminate upon
termination of this Deed of Trust. If the Mortgaged Property is sold pursuant to
the terms of this Deed of Trust, the assignment of rents will terminate and the
purchaser of the Mortgaged Property will have the right to all Rents free of the
assignment.

         ARTICLE IX. Trustee's Sale.

                  Section 9.1. If an Event of Default occurs, Trustee will, at
the request of Mortgagee, sell all or any part of the Mortgaged Property as an
entirety or in parcels, by one sale or by several sales held at one time or at
different times, all as Trustee in Trustee's discretion elects. The sale will be
made in accordance with Texas Property Code Section 51.002 or any successor
statute. If the Land is situated in more than one county, then required notices
will be given in both or all of such counties, the Mortgaged Property may be
sold in either or any such county, and such notices shall designate the county
where the Mortgaged Property will be sold. The affidavit of any person having
knowledge of the facts to the effect that required notices were posted, filed or
mailed will be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the affidavit. The
Trustee's deed at any such sale will be with general warranty, and Mortgagor
will warrant and forever defend the title of the purchaser or purchasers.
Mortgagee or any Bank may be the purchaser at any sale made hereunder, and
credit the sale price against the Debt. Any deed so executed by Trustee will be
prima facie proof of all factual matters stated in it. The purchaser or
purchasers named in any such deed, and all persons subsequently dealing with the
property purported to be thereby conveyed, will be fully protected in relying
upon the truthfulness of factual matters stated in the deed. After any Trustee's
sale, Mortgagor will surrender immediate possession and control of the property
purchased to the purchaser. If Mortgagor fails to surrender possession,
Mortgagor will be a tenant at will.

                  Section 9.2. Mortgagee may at any time before the sale direct
Trustee to abandon the sale, and may at any time thereafter direct Trustee to
again commence foreclosure. Whether or not foreclosure is commenced by Trustee,
Mortgagee may at any time after an Event of Default occurs institute suit for
collection of all or any part of the Debt or foreclosure of the lien of this
Deed of Trust or both. If Mortgagee institutes suit for collection of the Debt
and foreclosure of the lien of this Deed of Trust, Mortgagee may at any time
before the entry of final judgment dismiss the same, and require Trustee to sell
the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the provisions of this Deed of Trust.
No single sale or series of sales under this Deed of Trust or by judicial
foreclosure will extinguish the lien or exhaust the power of sale under this
Deed of Trust except with respect to the items of property sold.

                  Section 9.3. Trustee will apply the proceeds of sale, first to
the payment of all expenses of the sale, second to the payment of the Debt in
any order Mortgagee chooses and third the balance, if any, to any person who is
entitled to it. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT GIVE ANY RIGHT, REMEDY OR CLAIM TO ANY
HOLDER OF ANY OBLIGATION OR LIEN, OTHER THAN MORTGAGEE AND THE BANKS.

         ARTICLE X. Alternative Procedures under UCC. In addition to all other
rights and remedies granted in this Deed of Trust, after an Event of Default
occurs, Mortgagee will have all rights and remedies of a secured party after
default under the UCC and other applicable law, including without limitation,
the right to take possession of the Collateral, and for that purpose Mortgagee
may enter upon



DEED OF TRUST, ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 9



<PAGE>

the Mortgaged Property and lawfully remove any Collateral. Mortgagee may require
Mortgagor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Mortgagee at a
reasonably convenient place Mortgagee designates. Mortgagee may provide a copy
of this Deed of Trust to any account debtor or other person liable on or having
any interest in any Collateral. Except for the reasonable safe custody of any
Collateral in its possession and accounting for moneys actually received by it
and except as expressly provided in the UCC, Mortgagee will have no duty as to
any Collateral, including any duty to preserve rights against prior parties.
Mortgagee is not required to take possession of any Collateral prior to any
sale, or to have any Collateral present at any sale. Mortgagee may sell part of
the Collateral without waiving its right to proceed against the remaining
Collateral. If any sale is not completed or is defective in the opinion of
Mortgagee, Mortgagee may make a subsequent sale of the same Collateral. Any bill
of sale or other record evidencing any foreclosure sale will be prima facie
evidence of the factual matters recorded therein. If a sale of Collateral is
conducted in conformity with customary practices of banks disposing of similar
property, the sale will be deemed commercially reasonable, but Mortgagee will
have no obligation to advertise or to sell Collateral on credit. However, if
Mortgagee sells any of the Collateral upon credit, Mortgagor will be credited
only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by Mortgagee and
applied to the indebtedness of the purchaser with respect to the sale. In the
event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Mortgagee may resell the
Collateral and Mortgagor shall be credited with the proceeds of the sale. In
addition, Mortgagor waives any and all rights that Mortgagor may have to a
judicial hearing in advance of the enforcement of any of Mortgagee's or any
Bank's rights hereunder, including without limitation, its rights following an
Event of Default to take immediate possession of the Collateral and to exercise
its rights with respect thereto. By exercising its rights, neither Mortgagee nor
any Bank will become liable for, and Mortgagor will not be released from, any of
Mortgagor's duties or obligations under any accounts, general intangibles or
Leases included in the Collateral. All remedies in this Deed of Trust are
cumulative of any and all other legal, equitable or contractual remedies
available to Mortgagee and the other Banks and any such remedies may be
exercised simultaneously or in any order as determined by Mortgagee. Mortgagor
irrevocably appoints Mortgagee as its attorney-in-fact to do all things
Mortgagor is required to do under this Deed of Trust. This appointment is
coupled with an interest and shall survive the death or disability of Mortgagor.

         ARTICLE XI. Standards for Exercising Remedies. To the extent that
applicable law imposes duties on Mortgagee to exercise remedies in a
commercially reasonable manner, Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that it is not
commercially unreasonable for Mortgagee (a) to fail to incur expenses reasonably
deemed significant by Mortgagee to prepare any Collateral for disposition or
otherwise to complete raw material for work-in-process into finished goods or
other finished products for disposition, (b) to fail to obtain third party
consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or if not
required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents
for the collection or disposition of the Collateral to be collected or disposed
of, (c) to fail to exercise collection remedies against account debtors or other
persons obligated on Collateral or to remove liens on or any adverse claims
against the Collateral, (d) to exercise collection remedies against account
debtors and other persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of
collection agencies and other collection specialists, (e) to advertise
dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation,
whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (f) to contact other
persons, whether or not in the same business as Mortgagor, for expressions of
interest in acquiring all or any portion of the Collateral, (g) to hire one or
more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral,
whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (h) to dispose of
Collateral by utilizing Internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of
the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of
doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (i) to dispose of assets
in wholesale rather than retail markets, (j) to disclaim disposition warranties,
(k) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure Mortgagee against
risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide Mortgagee a



DEED OF TRUST, ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 10


<PAGE>

guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, (l) to the
extent deemed appropriate by Mortgagee, to obtain the services of brokers,
investment bankers, consultants and other professionals (including Mortgagee and
its affiliates) to assist Mortgagee in the collection or disposition of any of
the Collateral or (m) to comply with any applicable state or federal law
requirement in connection with the disposition or collection of the Collateral.
Mortgagor acknowledges that this Section is intended to provide non-exhaustive
indications of what actions or omissions by Mortgagee would not be commercially
unreasonable in Mortgagee's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that
other actions or omissions by Mortgagee shall not be deemed commercially
unreasonable solely by not being included in this Section. Without limitation
upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to
grant any rights to Mortgagor or to impose any duties upon Mortgagee that would
not have been granted or imposed by this Deed of Trust or by applicable law in
the absence of this Section.

         ARTICLE XII. Change of Trustee. Trustee may be removed at any time with
or without cause, at the option of Mortgagee, by written declaration of removal
executed by Mortgagee, without any notice to or demand upon Trustee, Mortgagor
or any other person. If at any time Trustee is removed, dies or refuses, fails
or is unable to act as Trustee, Mortgagee may appoint any person as successor
Trustee hereunder, without any formality other than a written declaration of
appointment executed by Mortgagee. Immediately upon appointment, the successor
Trustee so appointed automatically will be vested with all the estate and title
in the Mortgaged Property, and with all of the rights, powers, privileges,
authority, options and discretions, and charged with all of the duties and
liabilities, vested in or imposed upon Trustee by this instrument, and any
conveyance executed by any successor Trustee will have the same effect and
validity as if executed by the Trustee named in this Deed of Trust.

         ARTICLE XIII. Fair Market Value for Calculating Deficiencies. If
Mortgagee sues Mortgagor, Borrower, any other party obligated on the Debt or any
guarantor of any Debt to collect any deficiency owing after foreclosure of the
Mortgaged Property, "fair market value" of the Mortgaged Property under Sections
51.003, 51.004, and 51.005 of the Texas Property Code (as amended from time to
time) (the "Deficiency Statutes") will be determined as follows:

                  Section 13.1. Any valuation of the Mortgaged Property will be
based on "as is" condition on the foreclosure date, without any assumption or
expectation that the Mortgaged Property will be repaired or improved in any
manner before a resale of the Mortgaged Property after foreclosure.

                  Section 13.2. Any valuation will assume that the foreclosure
purchaser desires resale of the Mortgaged Property for cash promptly (but no
later than twelve months) following the foreclosure sale.

                  Section 13.3. All reasonable closing costs customarily borne
by the seller in a commercial real estate transaction, including brokerage
commissions, title insurance, a survey of the Mortgaged Property, tax
prorations, attorney's fees, and marketing costs, will be deducted from the
gross fair market value of the Mortgaged Property.

                  Section 13.4. Any valuation will further discount the gross
fair market value of the Mortgaged Property to account for any estimated holding
costs associated with maintaining the Mortgaged Property pending sale, including
utilities expenses, property management fees, taxes and assessments, and other
maintenance expenses.

                  Section 13.5. Any expert opinion testimony given or considered
in connection with a determination of the fair market value of the Mortgaged
Property must be given by persons who have at

least five years experience in appraising property similar to the Mortgaged
Property and who have conducted and prepared a complete written appraisal of the
Mortgaged Property taking into consideration the factors set forth above.

         ARTICLE XIV. All Security Cumulative; Subrogation; Waiver of
Marshaling. The execution of this Deed of Trust does not impair any other
security for the payment of any Debt. Mortgagee may take additional security for
any Debt in the future without altering or impairing the lien of this Deed of
Trust. Mortgagee may release any Mortgaged Property or any other security for
the Debt without altering or impairing the lien of this Deed of Trust as to the
Mortgaged Property not released. All present and future security will be
cumulative. Mortgagee and the Banks shall be subrogated to all rights, liens or
interests in any of the Mortgaged Property securing the payment of any
obligation satisfied or paid off out of the proceeds of the loans evidenced by
the Notes. Mortgagor waives any right of marshaling of assets or sale in inverse
order of alienation, and all present or future appraisal rights and equity of
redemption rights.

         ARTICLE XV. Limitations on Amount of Interest. Mortgagor and Mortgagee
intend to conform strictly to applicable usury laws. Therefore, the total amount
of interest (as defined under applicable law) contracted for, charged or
collected under the Debt or this Deed of Trust will never exceed the highest
amount permitted by applicable law. If Mortgagee contracts for, charges or
receives any excess interest, it will be deemed a mistake. Any unlawful contract
or charge will be automatically reformed to conform to applicable law, and if
Mortgagee has received excess interest, Mortgagee will either refund the excess
to Mortgagor or credit the excess on the unpaid amounts owing under the Debt or
this Deed of Trust. All amounts constituting interest will be spread throughout
the full term of the Debt in determining whether interest exceeds lawful
amounts.

         ARTICLE XVI. Financing Statement; Mortgagor's Covenants; Further
Assurances. This Deed of Trust covers, among other Collateral, goods that are or
are to become fixtures related to the Land and the Improvements. This Deed of
Trust is to be filed in the real property records as a fixture filing, and may
be filed as an initial financing statement in any other place which is necessary
or desirable to perfect the security interests granted herein. The secured party
is Mortgagee and the mailing address of the secured party is set forth in
Section 17. The debtor is Mortgagor and the mailing address of the debtor is set
forth in Section 17. The first paragraph of this Deed of Trust indicates whether
Mortgagor is an individual or an organization and if Mortgagor is an
organization, its jurisdiction of organization and organizational identification
number, if any. Mortgagor is the record owner of the Land and the Improvements.
Mortgagee may file this Deed of Trust, or any financing statements or amendments
thereto or other record wherever Mortgagee believes necessary or appropriate to
perfect the security interests granted herein, including but not limited to any
official filing office, or in any other recording or registration system. The
financing statement or other record may (a) indicate the Collateral as being of
an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail than set forth in this Deed of
Trust and (b) contain any other information required by the UCC or other law
regarding the notification of a security interest, lien, assignment or other
right to direct disposition, for the sufficiency of the filing office's or other
registrar's acceptance of any financing statement or amendments thereto or other
record including (i) if Mortgagor is an organization, the type of organization
and any organization identification number issued to Mortgagor and (ii) in the
case of a financing statement filed as a fixture filing, a sufficient
description of real property to which the Collateral relates. Mortgagor ratifies
its authorization for Mortgagee's filing of any financing statements covering
the Collateral in any jurisdiction prior to the date hereof. A photographic or
other reproduction of this Deed of Trust or any financing statement relating to
this Deed of Trust will be sufficient as a financing statement. Mortgagor will
take any action requested by Mortgagee to establish and maintain control by
Mortgagee of any Collateral consisting of deposit accounts, letter of credit
rights and investment property and to create, attach, perfect, protect, assure
the first priority of and to enforce the liens and security interests granted
hereunder.

</Table>

         ARTICLE XVIII. Additional Agreements. This Deed of Trust benefits the
successors, assigns and legal representatives of Trustee, Mortgagee and the
Banks and binds any successors or transferees of Mortgagor (however, this
provision does not permit Mortgagor to transfer the Mortgaged Property). Each
reference to Mortgagor, Trustee, Mortgagee or any Bank includes their respective
successors, assigns and legal representatives. No modification or waiver of this
Deed of Trust will be effective unless in writing and signed by Mortgagee.
Mortgagee and the Banks may waive any default without waiving any other prior or
subsequent default. Neither Mortgagee's nor any Bank's failure to exercise or
delay in exercising any rights under this Deed of Trust will not operate as a
waiver of those rights. If any provision of this Deed of Trust is unenforceable
or invalid, that provision will not affect the enforceability or validity of any
other provision. If the application of any provision of this Deed of Trust to
any person or circumstance is illegal or unenforceable, that application will
not affect the legality or enforceability of the provision as to any other
person or circumstance. If more than one person executes this Deed of Trust as
Mortgagor, their obligations under this Deed of Trust are joint and several.

         ARTICLE XIX. Rules of Construction. The section headings or captions in
this instrument are for convenience and are not a part of this Deed of Trust for
any purpose. Any action permitted to Mortgagee or any Bank may be taken by any
authorized officer, employee or agent of Mortgagee or such Bank, or any
attorney, accountant, environmental consultant or other advisor or professional
retained by Mortgagee or such Bank. Use of the term "including" does not imply
any limitation on (but may expand) the antecedent reference. Unless the context
clearly requires otherwise, the term "may" does not imply any obligation to act.
Any reference to exhibits or schedules means the exhibits or schedules to this
Deed of Trust, which are fully incorporated by reference into this Deed of
Trust. Any reference to a particular document includes all modifications,
supplements, replacements, renewals or extensions of that document, but this
rule of construction does not authorize amendment of any document without
Mortgagee's consent.

         ARTICLE XX. Security Interest Absolute. All rights of Mortgagee and the
liens and security interests granted by this Deed of Trust, and all obligations
of Mortgagor hereunder, are and will be absolute and unconditional, irrespective
of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, the
Notes or any other Loan Document; (ii) any change in the time, manner, or place
of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Debt or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement
or the Notes or any other Loan Document; (iii) any exchange, release or
non-perfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of
or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Debt; or (iv)
any other circumstance which

AND FINANCING STATEMENT - Page 13



<PAGE>

might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any person
liable for the Debt, the Borrower or a third party grantor of any lien or
security interest.

         ARTICLE XXI. Waivers. Mortgagor waives all suretyship defenses that may
lawfully be waived, including but not limited to notice of acceptance of this
Deed of Trust, notice of the incurrence, acquisition or subordination of any
Debt, credit extended, collateral received or delivered or other action taken in
reliance on this Deed of Trust, notices and all other demands and notices of any
description. With respect to both Debt and the Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor
assents to any extension or postponement of the time of payment or any other
indulgence, to any substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect
Mortgagee's security interest or lien in any of the Mortgaged Property, to the
addition or release of any person primarily or secondarily liable, to the
acceptance of partial payment thereon and the settlement, compromising or
adjusting of any thereof, all in such manner and at such time or times as
Mortgagee may deem advisable. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law,
Mortgagor further waives (i) diligence and promptness in preserving liability of
any person on the Debt, and in collecting or bringing suit to collect the Debt;
(ii) all rights, if any, of Mortgagor under Rule 31, Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, or Chapter 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, or Section
17.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code; (iii) to the extent
Mortgagor is subject to the Texas Revised Partnership Act ("TRPA"), compliance
by Mortgagee with Section 3.05(d) of TRPA; (iv) notice of extensions, renewals,
modifications, rearrangements and substitutions of the Debt; (v) failure to pay
any of the Debt as it matures, any other default, adverse change in any
obligor's or any Mortgagor's financial condition, release or substitution of
collateral, subordination of Mortgagee's rights in any collateral, and every
other notice of every kind. Nothing in this Deed of Trust is intended to waive
or vary the duties of Mortgagee or the rights of Mortgagor or any obligor in
violation of Section 9.602 of the UCC.

         ARTICLE XXII. No Oral Agreements. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE
CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
THE PARTIES.

         ARTICLE XXIII. JURY TRIAL WAIVER. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, MORTGAGOR AND MORTGAGEE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY THAT MORTGAGOR OR MORTGAGEE MAY
HAVE IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
DEED OF TRUST OR THE DEBT. MORTGAGOR REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF MORTGAGEE HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT MORTGAGEE WILL NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS RIGHT
TO JURY TRIAL WAIVER. MORTGAGOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MORTGAGEE HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS DEED OF TRUST BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
SECTION.

         Mortgagor has executed this Deed of Trust on the date set forth in the
acknowledgment below to be effective as of August 29, 2003.
