<p>In the event of any actual or alleged (a) failure by the Insureds to give</p>

<p></p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEPLETION OF UNDERLYING LIMIT(S)</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the event of the depletion of the limit(s) of liability of the</p>

<p>Underlying Insurance solely as the result of actual payment of</p>

<p>losses thereunder by the applicable insurers, this Policy shall, subject to</p>

<p>the Insurer's Limit of Liability and to the other</p>

<p>terms of this Policy, continue to apply to losses as Excess Insurance over</p>

<p>the amount of insurance remaining under such</p>

<p>Underlying Insurance. In the event of the exhaustion of all of the limits)</p>

<p>of liability of such Underlying Insurance solely</p>

<p>as a result of payment of losses thereunder, the remaining limits available</p>

<p>under this Policy shall, subject to the Insurer's</p>

<p>Limit of Liability and to the other provisions of this Policy, continue for</p>

<p>subsequent losses as primary insurance and any</p>

<p>retention specified in the Primary Policy shall be imposed under this</p>

<p>Policy as to each claim made; otherwise no</p>

<p>retention shall be imposed under this Policy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This Policy only provides coverage excess of the Underlying Insurance. This</p>

<p>Policy does not provide coverage for any</p>

<p>loss not covered by the Underlying Insurance except and to the extent that</p>

<p>such loss is not paid under the Underlying</p>

<p>Insurance solely by reason of the reduction or exhaustion of the available</p>

<p>Underlying Insurance through payments of</p>

<p>loss thereunder. In the event the insurer of one or more of the Underlying</p>

<p>Insurance policies fails to pay loss in</p>

<p>connection with any claim covered under the Underlying Insurance as a</p>

<p>result of the insolvency, bankruptcy, or</p>

<p>liquidation of said insurer, then the Insureds hereunder shall be deemed to</p>

<p>have retained any loss for the amount of the</p>

<p>limit of liability of said insurer which is not paid as a result of such</p>

<p>insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If any Underlying Insurance bears an effective date which is prior to the</p>

<p>effective date of this Policy and if any such</p>

<p>insurance becomes exhausted or impaired by payment of loss with respect to</p>

<p>any claim which, shall be deemed to be</p>

<p>made prior to the effective date of this Policy, then with respect to any</p>

<p>claim made after the effective date of this Policy,</p>

<p>the Insureds shall be deemed to have retained any loss for the amount of</p>

<p>any such Underlying Insurance which is</p>

<p>exhausted or impaired by payment of loss with respect to such claim made</p>

<p>prior to the effective date of this Policy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp; CLAIM PARTICIPATION</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Insured shall not admit liability, consent to any judgment against</p>

<p>them, or agree to any settlement which is</p>

<p>reasonably likely to involve the Limit of Liability of this Policy without</p>

<p>the Insurer's consent, such consent not to be</p>

<p>unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Insurer may, at its sole discretion, elect to participate in the</p>

<p>investigation, settlement or defense of any claim against</p>

<p>any of the Insureds for matters covered by this Policy even if the</p>

<p>Underlying Insurance has not been exhausted.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All provisions of the Underlying Insurance are considered as part of this</p>

<p>Policy except that it shall be the duty of the</p>

<p>Insureds and not the duty of the Insurer to defend any claims against any</p>

<p>of the Insureds.</p>

<p></p>

<p>VII.&nbsp; SUBROGATION - RECOVERIES</p>

<p></p>

<p>In that this Policy is "Excess Coverage", the Insureds and the Insurer's</p>

<p>right of recovery against any person or other</p>

<p>entity may not be exclusively subrogated. Despite the foregoing, in the</p>

<p>event of any payment under this Policy, the</p>

<p>Insurer shall be subrogated to all the Insured's rights of recovery against</p>

<p>any person or organization, and the Insureds</p>

<p>shall execute and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is</p>

<p>necessary to secure such rights.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Any amounts recovered after payment of loss hereunder shall be apportioned</p>

<p>in the inverse order of payment to the</p>

<p>extent of actual payment. The expenses of all such recovery proceedings</p>

<p>shall be apportioned in the ratio of respective</p>

<p>recoveries.</p>

<p></p>

<p>VIII. NOTICE</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Insurer shall be given notice in writing as soon as is practicable in</p>
