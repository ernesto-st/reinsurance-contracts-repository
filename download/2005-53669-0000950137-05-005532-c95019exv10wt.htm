<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares (the

Florida corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;); and

entities, plans to continue doing business with the United States Government
in the areas of security services, operations and maintenance functions for
a portion of facilities, and providing services relating to building
controls, energy savings and other products or services provided by Seller&#146;s

desires to purchase from Seller, all of the Shares as more specifically
provided herein;

undertakings contained herein, and subject to and on the terms and
conditions herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

$279.1&nbsp;million, as adjusted pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.2(b) below (the
&#147;Preliminary Purchase Price&#148;) and (ii) (A)&nbsp;plus the amount by which

of this Agreement, Buyer shall perform additional due diligence
pursuant to the terms of that certain offer letter from an affiliate
of Buyer dated November&nbsp;15, 2004 and executed by Seller and receive
the Disclosure Letter from Seller pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.05. Based
upon any information obtained by Buyer during the course of Buyer&#146;s
due diligence with respect to the Company, or any information
contained in the Disclosure Letter (or Buyer&#146;s due diligence with
respect thereto), and any further negotiations between Buyer and
Seller, Buyer and Seller shall either (i)&nbsp;confirm that the Preliminary
Purchase Price shall remain $279.1&nbsp;million or (ii)&nbsp;agree to a new
Preliminary Purchase Price, in either case, in writing within
twenty-two (22)&nbsp;business days after January&nbsp;10, 2005. Buyer and
Seller acknowledge that any renegotiation of the Preliminary Purchase
Price is not limited to a downward adjustment for errors or other
numerically quantified items identified in Buyer&#146;s due diligence
review, the Disclosure Letter, or Buyer&#146;s due diligence with respect
thereto, but may take into account broader negative implications from
Buyer&#146;s perspective flowing therefrom affecting Buyer&#146;s valuation of
the Company. Buyer shall provide a notice to Seller with respect to
its proposed Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to the foregoing
sentence within twenty (20)&nbsp;business days after January&nbsp;10, 2005. If
the Buyer and Seller cannot reach an agreement with respect to either
subsection (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;hereof, either party shall have the right to
cancel and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1 hereof.

the specific amount of adjustment to the Final Net Working Capital
Amount requested by Seller (a &#147;Notice of Objection&#148;).

shall attempt to resolve their differences regarding the Final Net

Objection has been received. If this is not possible within a
period of thirty (30)&nbsp;days of Buyer&#146;s receipt of the Notice of
Objection, an independent accounting firm shall prepare a binding
Closing Date Balance Sheet, including a determination of the Final
Net Working Capital Amount. The independent accounting firm (the
&#147;Designated Accountant&#148;) shall be a &#147;Big 4&#148; accounting firm
selected by the mutual consent of Buyer and Seller at the request
of either of the Parties. The decision of the Designated
Accountant with respect to the Final Net Working Capital Amount
shall be final and binding on the Parties. However, its review
shall be limited to the points raised in the Notice of Objection
based on supporting documentation provided by Buyer and Seller.
The Designated Accountant may not amend the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Purchase Price Report to a greater extent than
provided for in the Notice of Objection. The costs of the
Designated Accountant shall be equally shared between the Parties.

breach of this Section&nbsp;8.6 will be inadequate and that, in addition to
any other remedies Buyer may have, Buyer shall be entitled to
temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The matters set forth on Schedule&nbsp;2.7, Item&nbsp;3 of the Disclosure Letter, Schedule&nbsp;2.20(b) of the
Disclosure Letter, Schedule&nbsp;2.20(d)(ii)(x), Item&nbsp;3 of the Disclosure Letter and Schedule
2.24(vi), Item&nbsp;1 of the Disclosure Letter as described below:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AFCAP issued task order 5076 to Readiness Management Support, LLC (&#147;RMS&#148;) to build an
expeditionary village at Al Udeid AB, Qatar in late 2002. RMS directly contracted for power
production and subcontracted to Fluor for self-performing the site preparation and erection of
modular housing. Fluor&#146;s modular housing supplier, International Building Systems (&#147;IBS&#148;),
delivered units that did not meet several material and assembly specifications that were
included in the final purchase order. There were disagreements between the customer in the
field and the Air Force staff in the United States over the required speed of production and
degree of permanence of the units. Fluor terminated IBS and initiated legal action to recover
the cost of bringing the units up to specifications and completing the on-site construction.
During this process, the Air Force contracting officer was routinely advised of status. In
November, 2003, the contracting officer issued a termination for convenience letter for task
order 5076. RMS and Fluor jointly prepared and submitted a settlement proposal to the Air
Force, a response to which is expected by March, 2005. The maximum exposure in settling this
issue for RMS is approximately $26&nbsp;million. RMS has not paid Fluor for the cost overruns and
has not recognized cost/revenue on these costs.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As part of its duties at LANL, the Company oversaw the operation of a back-up steam plant in
area TA-21. The tank held diesel fuel to supply the boilers when they were needed. However, the
facility was seldom operated. The duties of the Company&#146;s personnel included monitoring the
contents of the above-ground storage tank. In 2002 it was discovered that fuel was missing from
the tank. Indications are that the fuel leaked from a portion of the 80-foot underground line
running from the tank to the

remaining part of the line, which had neither wrapping nor cathodic protection, was not
replaced because of LANL budgetary constraints. The Company was previously charged
approximately $300,000 for the investigation and assessment of this matter. No remediation has
been undertaken and no further demands have been made on the Company relating to this matter.
However, the contract is not yet closed out and this issue could come up again as part of the
closeout.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The matters set forth on Schedule&nbsp;2.8(vii), Items 2-4 of the Disclosure Letter and Schedule
5.3, Items 4-6 of the Disclosure Letter as described below and any matters relating to the
following entities (or their business or operations) or as a result of their transfer to
Seller:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(a)&nbsp;On or about December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company transferred to Seller all remaining assets of
American Power Technologies, Inc. (&#147;APT&#148;), acquired by the Company and merged into the Company
in 2000. This operation was part of the commercial facilities management business and was
transferred to the Seller in 2002. However, the prior asset transfer in 2002 had not
transferred APT&#146;s interest as an insured under various insurance policies to the Seller. The
Seller was served in December, 2004 with a lawsuit against APT and the Company. As part of
this clean up asset transfer, the Seller agreed to defend and indemnify the Company against any
claims arising out of the APT assets or operations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(b)&nbsp;On or about December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company transferred it&#146;s 20% interest in CFI Solutions,
Inc. to the Seller as a housekeeping item. This ownership interest is in a discontinued
operation related to the commercial facility management business, was not reflected in the
Company&#146;s financials and is not part of this transaction.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(c)&nbsp;On or about December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company transferred it&#146;s 20% interest in Computerized
Facility Integration, LLC to the Seller as a housekeeping item. This ownership interest is in
a discontinued operation related to the commercial facility management business, was not
reflected in the Company&#146;s financials and is not part of this transaction.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The matters set forth on Schedule&nbsp;2.10(d) of the Disclosure Letter as described below:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Several insurers who paid property damage claims to Con Edison for damage resulting from
collapse of World Trade Center 7 have brought a subrogation action. American Power
Technologies, Inc. is a named party. JCWS acquired APT in 2000 and APT was merged into JCWS
that same year. JCWS was served with a complaint on or about December&nbsp;6, 2004 in a lawsuit
that was apparently filed September&nbsp;10, 2004. American Power Technologies, Inc. is one of over
forty defendants. This action

substation and related electrical equipment owned by Consolidated Edison of New York. The
substation was located under WTC 7, which caught fire and collapsed into the substation several
hours after the twin towers fell. It is alleged, in very general terms, that APT was one of the
&#147;Construction Defendants&#148; who were involved in the design, construction, installation,
maintenance etc. of the various building systems of WTC 7. More specifically, it is alleged
that both the City of New York and Citigroup had contracted with various &#147;construction
defendants&#148; to design and install back-up power generating systems within WTC 7, including
large diesel fuel storage tanks. APT&#146;s specific involvement is not alleged, but this type of
construction was their line of business. It is alleged that the entire back up power system was
improperly designed, installed, etc. allowing the tanks to catch fire, resulting in damage to
WTC 7&#146;s support structure, leading to the collapse of the building and the damage to the Con Ed
substation. JCWS, Inc. (the old IFM business in Alpharetta), acquired the stock of APT in a
Stock Purchase Agreement in 2000. APT was merged into JCWS, effective 12/31/00 and articles of
merger were filed in New York and 18 other states where JCWS was licensed to do business.
