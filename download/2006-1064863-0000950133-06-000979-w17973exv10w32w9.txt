     with a high degree of quality and responsiveness, and has performed similar
     services for other public or private entities;

                   ARTICLE 5. MEMBER ELIGIBILITY & ENROLLMENT

SECTION 5.01 ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION

     The State or its designee will make eligibility determinations for each of
the HHSC HMO Programs.

SECTION 5.02 MEMBER ENROLLMENT & DISENROLLMENT.

     (a) The HHSC Administrative Services Contractor will enroll and disenroll
eligible individuals in the HMO Program. To enroll in an HMO, the Member's
permanent residence must be located within the HMO's Service Area. The HMO is
not allowed to induce or accept disenrollment from a Member. The HMO must refer
the Member to the HHSC Administrative Services Contractor.

     (b) HHSC makes no guarantees or representations to the HMO regarding the

the minimum mandatory enrollment periods established for each HHSC HMO Program.

     (c) The HHSC Administrative Services Contractor will electronically
transmit to the HMO new Member information and change information applicable to
active Members.

     (d) As described in the following Sections, depending on the HMO Program,
special conditions may also apply to enrollment and span of coverage for the
HMO.

     (e) HMO has a limited right to request a Member be disenrolled from HMO
without the Member's consent. HHSC must approve any HMO request for
disenrollment of a Member for cause. HHSC may permit disenrollment of a Member
under the following circumstances:

          (1) Member misuses or loans Member's HMO membership card to another
          person to obtain services.

          (2) Member is disruptive, unruly, threatening or uncooperative to the
          extent that Member's membership seriously impairs HMO's or Provider's
          ability to provide services to Member or to obtain new Members, and
          Member's behavior is not caused by a physical or behavioral health
          condition.

          (3) Member steadfastly refuses to comply with managed care
          restrictions (e.g., repeatedly using emergency room in combination
          with refusing to allow HMO to treat the underlying medical condition).

          (4) HMO must take reasonable measures to correct Member behavior prior
          to requesting disenrollment. Reasonable measures may include providing
          education and counseling regarding the offensive acts or behaviors.

     (f) HMO must notify the Member of HMO's decision to disenroll the Member if
all reasonable measures have failed to remedy the problem.

     (g) If the Member disagrees with the decision to disenroll the Member from
HMO, HMO must notify the Member of the availability of the Complaint procedure
and, for Medicaid Members, HHSC's Fair Hearing process.

     (h) HMO cannot request a disenrollment based on adverse change in the
member's health status or utilization of services that are Medically Necessary
for treatment of a member's condition.

SECTION 5.03 STAR ENROLLMENT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND INFANTS.

     (a) The HHSC Administrative Services Contractor will retroactively enroll
some pregnant Members in a Medicaid HMO based on their date of eligibility.

     (b) The HHSC Administrative Services Contractor will enroll newborns born
to Medicaid eligible mothers who are enrolled in a STAR HMO in the same HMO for

requests on a case-by- case basis. The HHSC Administrative Services Contractor
will retroactively, to date of birth, enroll newborns in the applicable STAR
HMO.

SECTION 5.04 CHIP ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT.

(a) Continuous coverage.

     A child who is CHIP-eligible will have six (6) months of continuous
coverage. Children enrolling in CHIP for the first time, or returning to CHIP
after disenrollment, will be subject to a waiting period before coverage
actually begins, except as provided


                                 Page 20 of 45

                            Contractual Document (CD)

Responsible Office: HHSC Office of General Counsel (OGC)

SUBJECT: ATTACHMENT A -- HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT          Version 1.0
         TERMS & CONDITIONS

in 1 T.A.C. Section 370.46. The waiting period for a child is determined by the
date on which he/she is found eligible for CHIP, and extends for a duration of
three months. If the child is found eligible for CHIP on or before the 15th day
of a month, then the waiting period begins on the first day of that same month.
If the child is found eligible on or after the 16th day of a month, then the
waiting period begins on the first day of the next month.

(b) Pregnant Members and Infants.

     The HHSC Administrative Contractor will refer pregnant CHIP Members, with
the exception of Legal Permanent Residents and other legally qualified aliens
barred from Medicaid due to federal eligibility restrictions, to Medicaid for
eligibility determinations. Those CHIP Members who are determined to be Medicaid
Eligible will be disenrolled from HMO's CHIP plan. Medicaid coverage will be
coordinated to begin after CHIP eligibility ends to avoid gaps in health care
coverage.

     In the event the HMO remains unaware of a Member's pregnancy until
delivery, the delivery will be covered by CHIP. The HHSC Administrative Services
Contractor will then set the Member's eligibility expiration date at the later
of (1) the end of the second month following the month of the baby's birth or
(2) the Member's original eligibility expiration date. Most newborns born to
CHIP Members or CHIP heads of household will be Medicaid eligible. Eligibility
of newborns must be determined for CHIP before enrollment can occur. For
newborns determined to be CHIP-eligible, the baby will be covered from the
beginning of the month of birth for the period of time specified in the evidence
of coverage.

SECTION 5.05 SPAN OF COVERAGE

(a) Medicaid HMOs.

     (1) HHSC will conduct continuous open enrollment for Medicaid Eligibles and
the HMO must accept all persons who choose to enroll as Members in the HMO or
who are assigned as Members in the HMO by HHSC, without regard to the Member's
health status or any other factor. Persons in a hospital on the enrollment date
will not be enrolled until they are discharged from the hospital.

     (2) Members who are disenrolled because they are temporarily ineligible for
Medicaid will be automatically re-enrolled into the same health plan, if
available. Temporary loss of eligibility is defined as a period of six months or
less.

     (3) A Member cannot change from one Medicaid MCO to another Medicaid MCO
during an inpatient hospital stay. The MCO responsible for the hospital charges
at the start of an Inpatient Stay remains responsible for hospital charges until
the time of discharge, or until such time that there is a loss of Medicaid
eligibility. Medicaid MCOs are responsible for professional charges during every
month for which the MCO receives a full capitation for a Member.

(b) CHIP HMOs.

     If a CHIP Member's Effective Date of Coverage occurs while the CHIP Member
is confined in a hospital, HMO is responsible for the CHIP Member's costs of
Covered Services beginning on the Effective Date of Coverage. If a CHIP Member
is disenrolled while the CHIP Member is confined in a hospital, HMO's
responsibility for the CHIP Member's costs of Covered Services terminates on the
Date of Disenrollment.

SECTION 5.06 VERIFICATION OF MEMBER ELIGIBILITY.

     Medicaid MCOs are prohibited from entering into an agreement to share
information regarding their Members with an external vendor that provides
verification of Medicaid recipients' eligibility to Medicaid providers. All such
external vendors must contract with the State and obtain eligibility information
from the State.

SECTION 5.07 SPECIAL TEMPORARY STAR DEFAULT PROCESS

     (a) STAR HMOs that did not contract with HHSC prior to the Effective Date
of the Contract to provide Medicaid Health Care Services will be assigned a
limited number of Medicaid-eligibles, who have not actively made a STAR HMO
choice, for a finite period. The number will vary by Service Area as set forth
below. To the extent possible, the special default assignment will be based on
each eligible's prior history with a PCP and geographic proximity to a PCP.

     (b) For the Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Harris, Tarrant, and Travis Service
Areas, the special default process will begin with the Operational Start Date
and conclude when the HMO has achieved an enrollment of 15,000 mandatory STAR
members, or at the end of six months, whichever comes first.

     (c) For the Lubbock Service Area, the special default process will begin
with the Operational Start Date and conclude when the HMO has achieved an
enrollment of 5,000 mandatory STAR members, or at the end of six months,
whichever comes first.

     (d) Special default periods may be extended for one or more Service Areas
if consistent with HHSC administrative rules.

     (e) This Section does not apply to the Nueces Service Area.

to HHSC, for HHSC'S approval, a Corrective Action Plan that addresses
deficiencies identified in any audit(s), review(s), or inspection(s) within
thirty (30) calendar days of the close of the audit(s), review(s), or
inspection(s).

                   ARTICLE 10. TERMS & CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT

SECTION 10.01 CALCULATION OF MONTHLY CAPITATION PAYMENT.

     (a) This is a Risk-based contract. For each applicable HMO Program, HHSC
will pay the HMO fixed monthly Capitation Payments based on the number of
eligible and enrolled Members. HHSC will calculate the monthly Capitation
Payments by multiplying the number of Members by each applicable Member Rate
Cell. In consideration of the Monthly Capitation Payment(s), the HMO agrees to
provide the Services and Deliverables described in this Contract.

     (b) HMO will be required to provide timely financial and statistical
information necessary in the Capitation Rate determination process. Encounter
Data provided by HMO must conform to all HHSC requirements. Encounter Data
containing non-compliant information, including, but not limited to, inaccurate
client or member identification numbers, inaccurate provider identification
numbers, or diagnosis or procedures codes insufficient to adequately describe
the diagnosis or medical procedure performed, will not be considered in the
HMO's experience for rate-setting purposes.

     (c) Information or data, including complete and accurate Encounter Data, as
requested by HHSC for rate-setting purposes, must be provided to HHSC: (1)
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the letter from HHSC requesting the
information or data; and (2) no later than March 31st of each year.

     (d) The fixed monthly Capitation Rate consists of the following components:

          (1) an amount for Health Care Services performed during the month;

          (2) an amount for administering the program, and

          (3) an amount for the HMO's Risk margin.

Capitation Rates for each HMO Program may vary by Service Area and MCO. HHSC
will employ or retain qualified actuaries to perform data analysis and calculate
the Capitation Rates for each Rate Period.

     (e) HMO understands and expressly assumes the risks associated with the
performance of the duties and responsibilities under this Contract, including
the failure, termination or suspension of funding to HHSC, delays or denials of
required approvals, and cost overruns not reasonably attributable to HHSC.

SECTION 10.02 TIME AND MANNER OF PAYMENT.

     (a) During the Contract Term and beginning after the Operational Start
Date, HHSC will pay the monthly Capitation Payments by the 10th Business Day of
each month.

     (b) The HMO must accept Capitation Payments by direct deposit into the
HMO's account.

     (c) HHSC may adjust the monthly Capitation Payment to the HMO in the case
of an overpayment to the HMO, for Experience Rebate amounts due and unpaid, and
if money damages are assessed in accordance with ARTICLE 12 ("Remedies and
Disputes").

     (d) HHSC's payment of monthly Capitation Payments is subject to
availability of federal and state appropriations. If appropriations are not
available to pay the full monthly Capitation Payment, HHSC may:

          (1) equitably adjust Capitation Payments for all participating
     Contractors, and reduce scope of service requirements as appropriate in
     accordance with ARTICLE 8, or

          (2) terminate the Contract in accordance with ARTICLE 12 ("Remedies
     and Disputes").

SECTION 10.03 CERTIFICATION OF CAPITATION RATES.

     HHSC will employ or retain a qualified actuary to certify the actuarial
soundness of the Capitation Rates contained in this Contract. HHSC will also
employ or retain a qualified actuary to certify all revisions or modifications
to the Capitation Rates.

SECTION 10.04 MODIFICATION OF CAPITATION RATES.

     The Parties expressly understand and agree that the agreed Capitation Rates
are subject to modification in accordance with ARTICLE 8 ("Amendments and
Modifications,") if changes in state or federal laws, rules, regulations or
policies affect the rates or the actuarial soundness of the rates. HHSC will
provide the HMO notice of a modification to the Capitation Rates 60 days prior
to the effective date of the change, unless HHSC determines that circumstances
warrant a shorter notice period. If the HMO does not accept the rate change,
either Party may terminate the Contract in accordance with ARTICLE 12 ("Remedies
and Disputes").

SECTION 10.05 STAR CAPITATION STRUCTURE.

SUBJECT: ATTACHMENT A -- HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT          Version 1.0
         TERMS & CONDITIONS

          (2) TANF children over 12 months of age;

          (3) Expansion children over 12 months of age;

          (4) Newborns less than or equal to 12 months of age;

          (6) Expansion children less than or equal to 12 months of age;

          (7) Federal mandate children; and

          (8) Pregnant women.

(b)  STAR Capitation Rate development:

          (1) Capitation Rates for Rate Periods 1 and 2 for Service Areas with
     historical STAR Program participation.

          For Service Areas where HHSC operated the STAR Program prior to the
     Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC will develop base Capitation Rates by
     analyzing historical STAR Encounter Data and financial data for the Service
     Area. This analysis will apply to all MCOs in the Service Area, including
     MCOs that have no historical STAR Program participation in the Service
     Area. The analysis will include a review of historical enrollment and
     claims experience information; any changes to Covered Services and covered
     populations; rate changes specified by the Texas Legislature; and any other
     relevant information. If the HMO participated in the STAR Program in the
     Service Area prior to the Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC may modify
     the Service Area base Capitation Rates using diagnosis-based risk adjusters
     to yield the final Capitation Rates.

          (2) Capitation Rates for Rate Periods 1 and 2 for Service Areas with
     no historical STAR Program participation.

          For Service Areas where HHSC has not operated the STAR Program prior
     to the Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC will establish base Capitation
     Rates for Rate Periods 1 and 2 by analyzing Fee-for-Service claims data for
     the Service Area. This analysis will include a review of historical
     enrollment and claims experience information; any changes to Covered
     Services and covered populations; rate changes specified by the Texas
     Legislature; and any other relevant information.

          (3) Capitation Rates for subsequent Rate Periods for Service Areas
     with no historical STAR Program participation.

          For Service Areas where HHSC has not operated the STAR Program prior
     to the Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC will establish base Capitation
     Rates for the Rate Periods following Rate Period 2 by analyzing historical
     STAR Encounter Data and financial data for the Service Area. This analysis
     will include a review of historical enrollment and claims experience
     information; any changes to Covered Services and covered populations; rate
     changes specified by the Texas Legislature; and any other relevant
     information.

(c)  Acuity adjustment.

     HHSC may evaluate and implement an acuity adjustment methodology, or
alternative reasonable methodology, that appropriately reimburses the HMO for
acuity and cost differences that deviate from that of the community average, if
HHSC in its sole discretion determines that such a methodology is reasonable and
appropriate. The community average is a uniform rate for all HMOs in a Service
Area, and is determined by combining all the experience for all HMOs in a
Service Area to get an average rate for the Service Area.

(d)  Value-added Services will not be included in the rate-setting process.

SECTION 10.06 CHIP CAPITATION RATES STRUCTURE.

(a)  CHIP Rate Cells.

     CHIP Capitation Rates are defined on a per Member per month basis by the
Rate Cells applicable to a Service Area. CHIP Rate Cells are based on the
Member's age group as follows:

     (1) underage one (1);

     (2) ages one (1) through five (5);

     (3) ages six (6) through fourteen (14); and

     (4) ages fifteen (15) through eighteen (18).

(b)  CHIP Capitation Rate development:

     HHSC will establish base Capitation Rates by analyzing Encounter Data and
financial data for each Service Area. This analysis will include a review of
historical enrollment and claims experience information; any changes to Covered
Services and covered populations; rate changes specified by the Texas
Legislature; and any other relevant information. HHSC may modify the Service
Area base Capitation Rate using diagnosis based risk adjusters to yield the
final Capitation Rates.

(c)  Acuity adjustment.

     HHSC may evaluate and implement an acuity adjustment methodology, or
alternative reasonable methodology, that appropriately reimburses the HMO for
acuity and cost differences that deviate from that of the community average, if
HHSC in its sole discretion determines that such a methodology is reasonable and
appropriate. The community average is a uniform rate for all HMOs in a Service

HMO must provide certified Encounter Data and financial data as prescribed in
HHSC'S UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL. Such information may include, without
limitation: claims lag information by Rate Cell, capitation expenses, and stop

the first meeting, HHSC will describe the process used to generate the proposed
Capitation Rates, discuss major changes in the rate setting process, and receive

on the proposed Capitation Rates and rate setting process. After reviewing such
comments, HHSC will conduct a second meeting to discuss the final Capitation
Rates and changes resulting from HMO comments, if any.

SECTION 10.08 ADJUSTMENTS TO CAPITATION PAYMENTS.

(a)  Recoupment.

     HHSC may recoup a payment made to the HMO for a Member if:

     (2) the Member moves outside the United States, and the HMO has not
provided Covered Services to the Member during the month for which the payment
was made;

     (3) the Member dies before the first day of the month for which the payment

delivery. A delivery is the birth of a live born infant, regardless of the
duration of the pregnancy, or a stillborn (fetal death) infant of twenty (20)
weeks or more of gestation. A delivery does not include a spontaneous or induced
abortion, regardless of the duration of the pregnancy.

     (c) HMO must submit a monthly DSP Report as described in ATTACHMENT B to

         TERMS & CONDITIONS

SECTION 10.10 ADMINISTRATIVE FEE FOR SSI MEMBERS

(a) Administrative Fee.

     STAR HMOs will receive a monthly fee for administering benefits to each SSI
Beneficiary who voluntarily enrolls in the HMO (a "Voluntary SSI Member"), in
the amount identified in the HHSC MANAGED CARE CONTRACT document. The HHSC will
pay for Health Care Services for such Voluntary SSI Members under the Medicaid
Fee-for-Services program. SSI Beneficiaries in all Service Areas except Nueces
may voluntarily participate in the STAR Program; however, HHSC reserves the
right to discontinue such voluntary participation.

(b) Administrative services and functions.

          (1) HMO must perform the same administrative services and functions
for Voluntary SSI Members as are performed for other Members under this
contract. These administrative services and functions include, but are not
limited to:

     (i) prior authorization of services;

     (ii) all Member services functions, including linguistic services and
     Member materials in alternative formats for the blind and disabled;

     (iii) health education;

     (iv) utilization management using HHSC Administrative Services Contractor
     encounter data to provide service management and appropriate interventions;

health-related services to the HHSC Administrative Services Contractor for
claims adjudication and payment.

          (3) HMO must provide services to Voluntary SSI Members within the
HMO's Network unless necessary services are unavailable within Network. HMO must
also allow referrals to Out-of-Network providers if necessary services are not
available within the HMO's Network. Records must be forwarded to Member's PCP
following a referral visit.

(c) Members who become eligible for SSI

     A Member's SSI status is effective the date the State's eligibility system
identifies the Member as Type Program 13 (TP13). On this effective date, the
Member becomes a voluntary STAR enrollee.

SECTION 10.11 EXPERIENCE REBATE

(a) HMO's duty to pay.

     At the end of each Rate Year beginning with Rate Year 1, the HMO must pay
an Experience Rebate to HHSC if the HMO's Net Income before Taxes is greater
than 3% of the total Revenue for the period. The Experience Rebate is calculated
in accordance with the tiered rebate method set forth below based on the
consolidated Net Income before Taxes for all of the HMO's Service Areas and HMO
Programs included within the scope of the Contract, as measured by any positive
amount on the Financial-Statistical Report (FSR) as reviewed and confirmed by
HHSC.

(b) Graduated Experience Rebate Sharing Method.

ATTACHMENT B-1 to the HHSC MANAGED CARE CONTRACT document and HHSC'S UNIFORM
MANAGED CARE MANUAL:

     (1) The HMO will retain all Net Income before Taxes that is equal to or
less than 3% of the total Revenues received by the HMO.

     (2) HHSC and the HMO will share that portion of the Net Income before Taxes
that is over 3% but less than or equal to 7% of the total Revenues received with

         TERMS & CONDITIONS

"COST PRINCIPLES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES" and "FSR INSTRUCTIONS FOR
COMPLETION" found in HHSC'S UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL in accordance with
Section 8.05.

(d) Carry forward of prior Rate Year losses.

     Losses incurred by HMO for one Rate Year may be carried forward to the next
Rate Year, and applied as an offset against an Experience Rebate. Prior losses
may be carried forward for only one Rate Year for this purpose. If the HMO
offsets a loss against another HMO Service Area or HMO Program, only that
portion of the loss that was not used as an offset may be carried forward to the
next Rate Year.

(e) Settlements for payment.

     (1) There will be two settlements for HMO payment(s) of the State share of
the Experience Rebate. The first settlement shall equal 100% of the State share
of the Experience Rebate as derived from the FSR, and shall be paid on the same
day the 90-day FSR Report is submitted to HHSC, accompanied by an actuarial
opinion certifying the reserve.

     (2) The second settlement shall be an adjustment to the first settlement
and shall be paid by the HMO to HHSC on the same day that the 334-day FSR is
submitted to HHSC if the adjustment is a payment from the HMO to HHSC.

     (3) HHSC or its agent may audit or review the FSRs. If HHSC determines that
corrections to the FSRs are required, based on an HHSC audit/review or other
documentation acceptable to HHSC, to determine an adjustment to the amount of
the second settlement, then final adjustment shall be made within three years
from the date that the HMO submits the 334-day FSR.

     (4) HHSC may offset any Experience Rebates owed to the State from future
Capitation Payments, or collect such sums directly from the HMO. HHSC must
receive the first and second settlements by the specified due dates for the
first and second FSRs respectively or HMO will incur interest on the amounts due
at the current prime interest rate as set forth below. HHSC may adjust the
Experience Rebate if HHSC determines the HMO has paid amounts for goods or
services that are not reasonable, necessary, and allowable in accordance with
the HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL'S "COST PRINCIPLES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES" and "FSR INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION" and applicable federal
regulations. HHSC has final authority in auditing and determining the amount of
the Experience Rebate.

(f) Interest on Experience Rebate.

     Interest on any Experience Rebate owed to HHSC shall be charged beginning
thirty (30) days after the date that the first and second settlements are due.
In addition, if any adjusted amount is owed to HHSC at the final settlement
date, then interest will be charged on the adjusted amount owed beginning thirty
(30) days after the second settlement date to the date of the final settlement
payment. HHSC will calculate interest at the Department of Treasury's Median
Rate (resulting from the Treasury's auction of 13-week bills) for the week in
which the liability is assessed.

SECTION 10.12 PAYMENT BY MEMBERS.

(a) Medicaid HMOs

     Medicaid HMOs and their Network Providers are prohibited from billing or
collecting any amount from a Member for Health Care Services covered by this
Contract. HMO must inform Members of costs for non-covered services, and must
require its Network Providers to:

          (1) inform Members of costs for non-covered services prior to
     rendering such services; and

          (2) obtain a signed Private Pay form from such Members.

(b) CHIP HMOs.

     Families that meet the enrollment period cost share limit requirement must
report it to the HHSC Administrative Services Contractor. The HHSC
Administrative Service Contractor notifies the HMO that a family's cost share
limit has been reached. Upon notification from the HHSC Administrative Services
Contractor that a family has reached its cost-sharing limit for the term of
coverage, the HMO will generate and mail to the CHIP Member a new Member ID card
within five days, showing that the CHIP Member's cost-sharing obligation for
that term of coverage has been met. No cost-sharing may be collected from these
CHIP Members for the balance of their term of coverage.

     Providers are responsible for collecting all CHIP Member co-payments at the
time of service. Co-payments that families must pay vary according to their
income level. No co-payments apply, at any income level, to well-child or
well-baby visits or immunizations. Except for costs associated with unauthorized
non-emergency services provided to a Member by Out-of-Network providers and for
non-covered services, the co-payments outlined in the CHIP Cost Sharing table in
THE HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL are the only amounts that a provider may
collect from a CHIP-eligible family.

     Federal law prohibits charging cost-sharing or deductibles to CHIP Members
of Native Americans or Alaskan Natives. The HHSC Administrative Services
Contractor will notify the HMO of CHIP Members who are not subject to
cost-sharing requirements. The HMO is responsible for educating Providers
regarding the cost-sharing waiver for this population.

     A HMO's monthly Capitation Payment will not be reduced for a family's
failure to make its CHIP

premium payment. There is no relationship between the per Member/per month
amount owed to the HMO for coverage provided during a month and the family's
payment of its CHIP premium obligation for that month.

SECTION 10.13 RESTRICTION ON ASSIGNMENT OF FEES.

     During the term of the Contract, HMO may not, directly or indirectly,
assign to any third party any beneficial or legal interest of the HMO in or to
any payments to be made by HHSC pursuant to this Contract. This restriction does
not apply to fees paid to Subcontractors.

SECTION 10.14 LIABILITY FOR TAXES.

     HHSC is not responsible in any way for the payment of any Federal, state or
local taxes related to or incurred in connection with the HMO's performance of
this Contract. HMO must pay and discharge any and all such taxes, including any
penalties and interest. In addition, HHSC is exempt from Federal excise taxes,

any taxes levied on employee wages.

SECTION 10.15 LIABILITY FOR EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CHARGES AND BENEFITS.

     HMO will perform work under this Contract as an independent contractor and

payment of all employment-related charges incurred in connection with the
performance of this Contract, including but not limited to salaries, benefits,
employment taxes, workers compensation benefits, unemployment insurance and
benefits, and other insurance or fringe benefits for Staff.

SECTION 10.16 NO ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION.

     (a) HMO will not be entitled to nor receive from HHSC any additional
consideration, compensation, salary, wages, charges, fees, costs, or any other
type of remuneration for Services and Deliverables provided under the Contract,
except by properly authorized and executed Contract amendments.

     (b) No other charges for tasks, functions, or activities that are
incidental or ancillary to the delivery of the Services and Deliverables will be
sought from HHSC or any other state agency, nor will the failure of HHSC or any
other party to pay for such incidental or ancillary services entitle the HMO to
withhold Services and Deliverables due under the Agreement.

     (c) HMO will not be entitled by virtue of the Contract to consideration in
the form of overtime, health insurance benefits, retirement benefits, disability
retirement benefits, sick leave, vacation time, paid holidays, or other paid
leaves of absence of any type or kind whatsoever.

             ARTICLE 11. DISCLOSURE & CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION

     (e) In addition to the requirements expressly stated in this Section, HMO
must comply with any policy, rule, or reasonable requirement of HHSC that
relates to the safeguarding or disclosure of information relating to Members,
HMO'S operations, or HMO's performance of the Contract.

     (f) In the event of the expiration of the Contract or termination of the
Contract for any reason, all Confidential Information disclosed to and all
copies thereof made by the HMOI shall be returned to HHSC or, at HHSC's option,

destruction.

     (g) The obligations in this Section shall not restrict any disclosure by
the HMO pursuant to any applicable law, or by order of any court or government
agency, provided that the HMO shall give prompt notice to HHSC of such order.

     (h) With the exception of confidential Member information, Confidential
Information shall not be afforded the protection of the Contract if such data

     (a) HMO will immediately report to HHSC any and all unauthorized
disclosures or uses of HHSC's Confidential Information of which it or its
Subcontractor(s), consultant(s), or agent(s) is aware or has knowledge. HMO
acknowledges that any publication or disclosure of HHSC's Confidential
Information to others may cause immediate and irreparable harm to HHSC and may
constitute a violation of State or federal laws. If HMO, its Subcontractor(s),

to injunctive relief or any other remedies to which it is entitled under law or

     (2) HMO will, within five (5) Business Days (or another date approved by
HHSC) of receipt of written notice of a non-material deficiency, provide the
HHSC Project Manager a written response that:

          (A) Explains the reasons for the deficiency, HMO's plan to address or
     cure the deficiency, and the date and time by which the deficiency will be
     cured; or

          (B) If HMO disagrees with HHSC's findings, its reasons for disagreeing
     with HHSC's findings.

     (3) HMO's proposed cure of a non-material deficiency is subject to the
approval of HHSC. HMO's repeated commission of non-material deficiencies or
repeated failure to resolve any such deficiencies may be regarded by HHSC as a
material deficiency and entitle HHSC to pursue any other remedy provided in the
Contract or any other appropriate remedy HHSC may have at law or equity.

(c)  Corrective action plan.

     (1) At its option, HHSC may require HMO to submit to HHSC a written plan
(the "Corrective Action Plan") to correct or resolve a material breach of this
Contract, as determined by HHSC.

     (2) The Corrective Action Plan must provide:

          (A) A detailed explanation of the reasons for the cited deficiency;

          (B) HMO's assessment or diagnosis of the cause; and

          (C) A specific proposal to cure or resolve the deficiency.

         TERMS & CONDITIONS

     (3) The Corrective Action Plan must be submitted by the deadline set forth
in HHSC's request for a Corrective Action Plan. The Corrective Action Plan is
subject to approval by HHSC, which will not unreasonably be withheld.

     (4) HHSC will notify HMO in writing of HHSC's final disposition of HHSC's
concerns. If HHSC accepts HMO's proposed Corrective Action Plan, HHSC may:

          (A) Condition such approval on completion of tasks in the order or
     priority that HHSC may reasonably prescribe;

          (B) Disapprove portions of HMO's proposed Corrective Action Plan; or

          (C) Require additional or different corrective action(s).

          Notwithstanding the submission and acceptance of a Corrective Action
     Plan, HMO remains responsible for achieving all written performance
     criteria.

     (5) HHSC's acceptance of a Corrective Action Plan under this Section will
not:

          (A) Excuse HMO's prior substandard performance;

          (B) Relieve HMO of its duty to comply with performance standards; or

          (C) Prohibit HHSC from assessing additional tailored remedies or
     pursuing other appropriate remedies for continued substandard performance.

(d) Administrative remedies.

     (1) At its discretion, HHSC may impose one or more of the following
remedies for each item of material noncompliance and will determine the scope
and severity of the remedy on a case-by-case basis:

          (A) Assess liquidated damages in accordance with ATTACHMENT B-5 to the
     HHSC MANAGED CARE CONTRACT, "Liquidated Damages Matrix;"

          (B) Conduct accelerated monitoring of the HMO. Accelerated monitoring
     includes more frequent or more extensive monitoring by HHSC or its agent;

          (C) Require additional, more detailed, financial and/or programmatic
     reports to be submitted by HMO;

          (D) Decline to renew or extend the Contract;

          (E)Appoint temporary management;

          (F)Initiate disenrollment of a Member or Members;

          (G)Suspend enrollment of Members;

          (H) Withhold or recoup payment to HMO;

          (I) Require forfeiture of all or part of the HMO's bond; or

          (J) Terminate the Contract in accordance with SECTION 12.03,
     ("Termination by HHSC").

     (2) For purposes of the Contract, an item of material noncompliance means a
specific action of HMO that:

          (A) Violates a material provision of the Contract;

          (B) Fails to meet an agreed measure of performance; or

          (C) Represents a failure of HMO to be reasonably responsive to a
     reasonable request of HHSC relating to the Services for information,
     assistance, or support within the timeframe specified by HHSC.

     (3) HHSC will provide notice to HMO of the imposition of an administrative
remedy in accordance with this Section, with the exception of accelerated
monitoring, which may be unannounced. HHSC may require HMO to file a written
response in accordance with this Section.

     (4) The Parties agree that a State or Federal statute, rule, regulation, or
Federal guideline will prevail over the provisions of this Section unless the
statute, rule, regulation, or guidelines can be read together with this Section
to give effect to both.

(e) Damages.

     (1) HHSC will be entitled to actual and consequential damages resulting
from the HMO'S failure to comply with any of the terms of the Contract. In some
cases, the actual damage to HHSC or State of Texas as a result of HMO'S failure
to meet any aspect of the responsibilities of the Contract and/or to meet
specific performance standards set forth in the Contract are difficult or
impossible to determine with precise accuracy. Therefore, liquidated damages
will be assessed in writing against and paid by the HMO in accordance with and
for failure to meet any aspect of the responsibilities of the Contract and/or to
meet the specific performance standards identified by the HHSC in ATTACHMENT B-5
TO THE HHSC MANAGED CARE CONTRACT, "Deliverables/Liquidated Damages Matrix."
Liquidated damages will be assessed if HHSC determines such failure is the fault
of the HMO (including the HMO'S Subcontractors and/or consultants) and is not
materially caused or contributed to by HHSC or its agents. If at any time, HHSC
determines the HMO has not met any aspect of the responsibilities of the
Contract and/or the specific performance standards due to mitigating
circumstances, HHSC reserves the right to waive all or part of the liquidated
damages. All such waivers must be in writing, contain the reasons for the
waiver, and be signed by the appropriate executive of HHSC.

SUBJECT: ATTACHMENT A -- HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT          Version 1.0
         TERMS & CONDITIONS

     (2) The liquidated damages prescribed in this Section are not intended to
be in the nature of a penalty, but are intended to be reasonable estimates of
HHSC's projected financial loss and damage resulting from the HMO's
nonperformance, including financial loss as a result of project delays.
Accordingly, in the event HMO fails to perform in accordance with the Contract,
HHSC may assess liquidated damages as provided in this Section.

     (3) If HMO fails to perform any of the Services described in the Contract,
HHSC may assess liquidated damages for each occurrence of a liquidated damages
event, to the extent consistent with HHSC's tailored approach to remedies and
Texas law.

     (4) HHSC may elect to collect liquidated damages:

          (A) Through direct assessment and demand for payment delivered to HMO;
     or

          (B) By deduction of amounts assessed as liquidated damages as set-off
     against payments then due to HMO or that become due at any time after
     assessment of the liquidated damages. HHSC will make deductions until the
     full amount payable by the HMO is received by HHSC.

(f) Equitable Remedies

     (1) HMO acknowledges that, if HMO breaches (or attempts or threatens to
breach) its material obligation under this Contract, HHSC may be irreparably
harmed. In such a circumstance, HHSC may proceed directly to court to pursue
equitable remedies.

     (2) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that HMO breached (or
attempted or threatened to breach) any such obligations, HMO agrees that without
any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive
relief, it will not oppose the entry of an appropriate order compelling
performance by HMO and restraining it from any further breaches (or attempted or
threatened breaches).

(g) Suspension of Contract

     (1) HHSC may suspend performance of all or any part of the Contract if:

          (A) HHSC determines that HMO has committed a material breach of the
     Contract;

          (B) HHSC has reason to believe that HMO has committed, assisted in the
     commission of Fraud, Abuse, Waste, malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance
     by any party concerning the Contract;

          (C) HHSC determines that the HMO knew, or should have known of, Fraud,
     Abuse, Waste, malfeasance, or nonfeasance by any party concerning the
     Contract, and the HMO failed to take appropriate action; or

          (D) HHSC determines that suspension of the Contract in whole or in
     part is in the best interests of the State of Texas or the HHSC Programs.

     (2) HHSC will notify HMO in writing of its intention to suspend the
Contract in whole or in part. Such notice will:

          (A) Be delivered in writing to HMO;

          (B) Include a concise description of the facts or matter leading to
     HHSC's decision; and

          (C) Unless HHSC is suspending the contract for convenience, request a
     Corrective Action Plan from HMO or describe actions that HMO may take to
     avoid the contemplated suspension of the Contract.

to completion of the Contract Term, all or a part of this Contract may be
terminated for any of the following reasons:

(a)  Termination in the best interest of HHSC.

     HHSC may terminate the Contract without cause at anytime when, in its sole
discretion, HHSC determines that termination is in the best interests of the
State of Texas. HHSC will provide reasonable advance written notice of the
termination, as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. The termination
will be effective on the date specified in HHSC's notice of termination.

(b)  Termination for cause.

     HHSC reserves the right to terminate this Contract, in whole or in part,
upon the following conditions:

          (1) Assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment of receiver,

     become due; or

          (C) Consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or liquidator
     of HMO or of all or any part of its property.

          (2) Failure to adhere to laws, rules, ordinances, or orders.

HMO failed to adhere to any laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or orders of
any public authority having jurisdiction and such violation prevents or
substantially impairs performance of HMO's

     confidentiality laws with respect to the Services and Deliverables provided
     under this Contract.

          (4) Failure to maintain adequate personnel or resources.

          HHSC may terminate this Contract if, after providing notice and an
     opportunity to correct, HHSC determines that HMO has failed to supply
     personnel or resources and such failure results in HMO's inability to
     fulfill its duties under this Contract. HHSC will provide at least thirty
     (30) days advance written notice of such termination.

(5)  Termination for gifts and gratuities.

          (A) HHSC may terminate this Contract at any time following the
     determination by a competent judicial or quasi-judicial authority and HMO's
     exhaustion of all legal remedies that HMO, its employees, agents or
     representatives have either offered or given any thing of value to an
     officer or employee of HHSC or the State of Texas in violation of state
     law.

          (B) HMO must include a similar provision in each of its Subcontracts
     and shall enforce this provision against a Subcontractor who has offered or
     given any thing of value to any of the persons or entities described in
     this Section, whether or not the offer or gift was in HMO's behalf.

          (C) Termination of a Subcontract by HMO pursuant to this provision
     will not be a cause for termination of the Contract unless:

               (1) HMO fails to replace such terminated Subcontractor within a
          reasonable time; and

               (2) Such failure constitutes cause, as described in this

          (D) For purposes of this Section, a "thing of value" means any item of
     tangible or intangible property that has a monetary value of more than
     $50.00 and includes, but is not limited to, cash, food, lodging,
     entertainment, and charitable contributions. The term does not include
     contributions to holders of public office or candidates for public office
     that are paid and reported in accordance with State and/or Federal law.

(6)  Termination for non-appropriation of funds.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, if funds for the
     continued fulfillment of this Contract by HHSC are at any time not
     forthcoming or are insufficient, through failure of any entity to
     appropriate funds or otherwise, then HHSC will have the right to terminate
     this Contract at no additional cost and with no penalty whatsoever by
     giving prior written notice documenting the lack of funding. HHSC will
     provide at least thirty (30) days advance written notice of such
     termination. HHSC will use reasonable efforts to ensure appropriated funds
     are available.

(7)  Judgment and execution.

     (A) HHSC may terminate the Contract at any time if judgment for the payment
of money in excess of $500,000.00 that is not covered by insurance, is rendered

     with the terms of the judgment;

          (2) Procure a stay of execution of the judgment within thirty (30)
     days from the date of entry thereof; or

          (3) Perfect an appeal of such judgment and cause the execution of such
     judgment to be stayed during the appeal, providing such financial reserves
     as may be required under generally accepted accounting principles.

     (B) If a writ or warrant of attachment or any similar process is issued by

within thirty (30) days after its entry, HHSC may terminate the Contract in
accordance with this Section.

     proceedings related to its liquidation, insolvency, or the appointment of a

         TERMS & CONDITIONS

          (B) HMO agrees to pay for all reasonable expenses of HHSC including
     the cost of counsel, incident to:

               (1) The enforcement of payment of all obligations of the HMO by
          any action or participation in, or in connection with a case or

          previous collection attempts have been unsuccessful.

(9)  Termination for HMO'S material breach of the Contract.

     HHSC determines, at its sole discretion, that HMO has materially breached
     the Contract. HHSC will provide at least thirty (30) days advance written
     notice of such termination.

SECTION 12.04 TERMINATION BY HMO.

(a)  Failure to pay.

     HMO may terminate this Contract if HHSC fails to pay the HMO undisputed
charges when due as required under this Contract. Retaining premium, recoupment,
sanctions, or penalties that are allowed under this Contract or that result from
the HMO's failure to perform or the HMO's default under the terms of this
Contract is not cause for termination. Termination for failure to pay does not
release HHSC from the obligation to pay undisputed charges for services provided
prior to the termination date.

     If HHSC fails to pay undisputed charges when due, then the HMO may submit a
notice of intent to terminate for failure to pay in accordance with the
requirements of SUBSECTION 12.04(D). If HHSC pays all undisputed amounts then
due within thirty (30)-days after receiving the notice of intent to terminate,
the HMO cannot proceed with termination of the Contract under this Article.

(b)  Change to HHSC Uniform Managed Care Manual.

     HMO may terminate this agreement if the Parties are unable to resolve a
dispute concerning a material and substantive change to the HHSC Uniform Managed
Care Manual (a change that materially and substantively alters the HMO's ability
to fulfill its obligations under the Contract). HMO must submit a notice of
intent to terminate due to a material and substantive change in the HHSC Uniform
Managed Care Manual no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of
the policy change. HHSC will not enforce the policy change during the period of
time between the receipt of the notice of intent to terminate and the effective
date of termination.

(c)  Change to Capitation Rate.

     If HHSC proposes a modification to the Capitation Rate that is unacceptable
to the HMO, the HMO may terminate the Contract. HMO must submit a written notice
of intent to terminate due to a change in the Capitation Rate no later than
thirty (30) days after HHSC's notice of the proposed change. HHSC will not
enforce the rate change during the period of time between the receipt of the
notice of intent to terminate and the effective date of termination.

(d)  Notice of intent to terminate.

     In order to terminate the Contract pursuant to this Section, HMO must give
HHSC at least ninety (90) days written notice of intent to terminate. The
termination date will be calculated as the last day of the month following
ninety (90) days from the date the notice of intent to terminate is received by
HHSC.

SECTION 12.05 TERMINATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT.

     This Contract may be terminated by mutual written agreement of the Parties.

SECTION 12.06 EFFECTIVE DATE OF TERMINATION.

     Except as otherwise provided in this Contract, termination will be
effective as of the date specified in the notice of termination.

SECTION 12.07 EXTENSION OF TERMINATION EFFECTIVE DATE.

     The Parties may extend the effective date of termination one or more times
by mutual written agreement.

SECTION 12.08 PAYMENT AND OTHER PROVISIONS AT CONTRACT TERMINATION.

     (a) In the event of termination pursuant to this Article, HHSC will pay the
Capitation Payment for Services and Deliverables rendered through the effective
date of termination. All pertinent provisions of the Contract will form the
basis of settlement.

     (b) HMO must provide HHSC all reasonable access to records, facilities, and
documentation as is required to efficiently and expeditiously close out the
Services and Deliverables provided under this Contract.

     (c) HMO must prepare a Turnover Plan, which is acceptable to and approved
by HHSC. The Turnover Plan will be implemented during the time period between
receipt of notice and the termination date.

SECTION 12.09 MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT IN THE EVENT OF REMEDIES.

     HHSC may propose a modification of this Contract in response to the
imposition of a remedy under this Article. Any modifications under this Section
must be reasonable, limited to the matters causing the exercise of a remedy, in
writing, and

         TERMS & CONDITIONS

executed in accordance with ARTICLE 8. HMO must negotiate such proposed
modifications in good faith.

SECTION 12.10 TURNOVER ASSISTANCE.

     Upon receipt of notice of termination of the Contract by HHSC, HMO will
provide any turnover assistance reasonably necessary to enable HHSC or its
designee to effectively close out the Contract and move the work to another
vendor or to perform the work itself.

SECTION 12.11 RIGHTS UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF CONTRACT.

     In the event that the Contract is terminated for any reason, or upon its
expiration, HHSC will, at HHSC's discretion, retain ownership of any and all
associated work products, Deliverables and/or documentation in whatever form
that they exist.

 SECTION 12.12 HMO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSOCIATED COSTS.

     If HHSC terminates the Contract for Cause, the HMO will be responsible to
HHSC for all reasonable costs incurred by HHSC, the State of Texas, or any of
its administrative agencies to replace the HMO. These costs include, but are not
limited to, the costs of procuring a substitute vendor and the cost of any claim
or litigation that is reasonably attributable to HMO's failure to perform any
Service in accordance with the terms of the Contract

SECTION 12.13 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

(a)  General agreement of the Parties.

     The Parties mutually agree that the interests of fairness, efficiency, and
good business practices are best served when the Parties employ all reasonable
and informal means to resolve any dispute under this Contract. The Parties
express their mutual commitment to using all reasonable and informal means of
resolving disputes prior to invoking a remedy provided elsewhere in this
Section.

(b)  Duty to negotiate in good faith.

     Any dispute that in the judgment of any Party to this Contract may
materially or substantially affect the performance of any Party will be reduced
to writing and delivered to the other Party. The Parties must then negotiate in
good faith and use every reasonable effort to resolve such dispute and the
Parties shall not resort to any formal proceedings unless they have reasonably
determined that a negotiated resolution is not possible. The resolution of any
dispute disposed of by Contract between the Parties shall be reduced to writing
and delivered to all Parties within ten (10) Business Days.

(c)  Claims for breach of Contract.

     (1) General requirement. HMO's claim for breach of this Contract will be
resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution process established by HHSC
in accordance with Chapter 2260, Texas Government Code.

     (2) Negotiation of claims. The Parties expressly agree that the HMO's claim
for breach of this Contract that the Parties cannot resolve in the ordinary
course of business or through the use of all reasonable and informal means will
be submitted to the negotiation process provided in Chapter 2260, Subchapter B,
Texas Government Code.

          (A) To initiate the process, HMO must submit written notice to HHSC
     that specifically states that HMO invokes the provisions of Chapter 2260,
     Subchapter B, Texas Government Code. The notice must comply with the
     requirements of Title 1, Chapter 392, Subchapter B of the Texas
     Administrative Code.

          (B) The Parties expressly agree that the HMO's compliance with Chapter
     2260, Subchapter B, Texas Government Code, will be a condition precedent to
     the filing of a contested case proceeding under Chapter 2260, Subchapter C,
     of the Texas Government Code.

     (3) Contested case proceedings. The contested case process provided in
Chapter 2260, Subchapter C, Texas Government Code, will be HMO's sole and
exclusive process for seeking a remedy for any and all alleged breaches of
contract by HHSC if the Parties are unable to resolve their disputes under
Subsection (c)(2) of this Section.

     The Parties expressly agree that compliance with the contested case process
provided in Chapter 2260, Subchapter C, Texas Government Code, will be a
condition precedent to seeking consent to sue from the Texas Legislature under
Chapter 107, Civil Practices & Remedies Code. Neither the execution of this
Contract by HHSC nor any other conduct of any representative of HHSC relating to
this Contract shall be considered a waiver of HHSC's sovereign immunity to suit.

     (4) HHSC rules. The submission, processing and resolution of HMO's claim is
governed by the rules adopted by HHSC pursuant to Chapter 2260, Texas Government
Code, found at Title 1, Chapter 392, Subchapter B of the Texas Administrative
Code.

     (5) HMO's duty to perform. Neither the occurrence of an event constituting
an alleged breach of contract nor the pending status of any claim for breach of
contract is grounds for the suspension of performance, in whole or in part, by
HMO of any duty or obligation with respect to the performance of this Contract.
Any changes to the Contract as a result of a dispute resolution will be
implemented in accordance with ARTICLE 8 ("Amendments and Modifications").

          (A) HMO must maintain at its own expense, or cause its Network
     Providers to maintain, during the Term of the Contract and until final
     acceptance of all Services and Deliverables, Professional Liability
     Insurance for each Network Provider of $100,000.00 per occurrence and
     $300,000.00 in the aggregate, or the limits required by the hospital at
     which the Network Provider has admitting privileges. HMO must provide proof
     of such coverage upon request to HHSC.

          (B) HMO must maintain at its own expense, during the Term of the
     Contract and until final acceptance of all Services and Deliverables, an
     Umbrella Professional Liability Insurance Policy for the greater of

     represents the number of Members enrolled in the HMO in the first month of
     the applicable State Fiscal Year multiplied by $150.00, not to exceed
     $10,000,000.00. HMO will provide HHSC with proof of this insurance coverage
     on or before the Contract Effective Date.

     (3) Any exceptions to the insurance requirements of this Contract must be

state or federal units of government are exempt from the liability insurance
requirements of this Contract and are not required to obtain exemptions from
these provisions. State and federal units of government are required to comply

and renewal certificates of insurance, or such similar evidence, if the
coverages have an expiration or renewal date occurring during the term of the
Contract. HMO will submit original evidence of insurance prior to the Effective
Date of the Contract. The failure of HHSC to obtain such evidence from HMO
before permitting HMO to commence work will not be deemed to be a waiver by HHSC
and HMO will remain under continuing obligation to maintain and provide proof of
the insurance coverage.

     (2) The insurance specified above will be carried until all services
required to be performed under the terms of the Contract are satisfactorily
completed. Failure to carry or keep such insurance in force will constitute a
violation of the Contract.

     (3) The insurance will provide for thirty (30) calendar days prior written
notice to be given to HHSC in the event coverage is substantially changed,
canceled, or non-renewed. HMO must submit a new coverage binder to HHSC to
ensure no break in coverage.

     (4) HMO will require all Subcontractors operating in Texas to carry
Worker's Compensation coverage in the amounts required by Texas law. HMO will
also require Subcontractors to carry Comprehensive Liability Insurance including
Bodily Injury coverage or $100,000.00 per occurrence and Property Damage
Coverage of $25,000.00 per occurrence. HMO may provide the coverage for any or
all Subcontractors, and, if so, the evidence of insurance submitted will so
stipulate.

     (5) The Parties expressly understand and agree that any insurance coverages
and limits furnished by HMO will in no way expand or limit HMO's liabilities and
responsibilities specified within the Contract documents or by applicable law.

     (6) HMO expressly understands and agrees that any insurance maintained by
HHSC will apply in excess of and not contribute to insurance provided by HMO
under the Contract.

     (7) If HMO, or its Subcontractor(s), desire additional coverage, higher
limits of liability, or other modifications for its own protection, HMO and each
of its Subcontractors will be responsible for the acquisition and cost of such
additional protection.

6.   PREMIUM PAYMENT, INCENTIVES, AND DISINCENTIVES

This section documents how the Capitation Rates are developed and describes
performance incentives and disincentives related to HHSC's value-based
purchasing approach. For further information, HMOs should refer to the HHSC
UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

Under the HMO Contracts, health care coverage for Members will be provided on a
fully insured basis. The HMO must provide the Services and Deliverables,
including Covered Services to enrolled Members in order for monthly Capitation
Payments to be paid by HHSC. Attachment B-1, SECTION 8 includes the HMO's
financial responsibilities regarding out-of-network Emergency Services and
Medically Necessary Covered Services not available through Network Providers.

6.1  CAPITATION RATE DEVELOPMENT

Refer to ATTACHMENT A, HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT TERMS & CONDITIONS,
ARTICLE 10, "TERMS & CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT," for information concerning
Capitation Rate development.

6.2  FINANCIAL PAYMENT STRUCTURE AND PROVISIONS

HHSC will pay the HMO monthly Capitation Payments based on the number of
eligible and enrolled Members. HHSC will calculate the monthly Capitation
Payments by multiplying the number of Member months times the applicable monthly
Capitation Rate by Member rate cell. The HMO must provide the Services and
Deliverables, including Covered Services to Members, described in the Contract
for monthly Capitation Payments to be paid by HHSC.

The HMO must understand and expressly assume the risks associated with the
performance of the duties and responsibilities under the Contract, including the
failure, termination, or suspension of funding to HHSC, delays or denials of
required approvals, cost of claims incorrectly paid by the HMO, and cost
overruns not reasonably attributable to HHSC. The HMO must further agree that no
other charges for tasks, functions, or activities that are incidental or
ancillary to the delivery of the Services and Deliverables will be sought from
HHSC or any other state agency, nor will the failure of HHSC or any other party
to pay for such incidental or ancillary services entitle the HMO to withhold
Services or Deliverables due under the Contract.

6.2.1 CAPITATION PAYMENTS

     The HMO must refer to the HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT TERMS &
     CONDITIONS for information and Contract requirements on the:

6.3  PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES

HHSC introduces several financial and non-financial performance incentives and
disincentives through this Contract. These incentives and disincentives are
subject to change by HHSC over the course of the Contract Period. The
methodologies required to implement these strategies will be refined by HHSC
after collaboration with contracting HMOs through a new incentives workgroup to
be established by HHSC.

6.3.1 NON-FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

6.3.1.1 PERFORMANCE PROFILING

HHSC intends to distribute information on key performance indicators to HMOs on
a regular basis, identifying an HMO's performance, and comparing that
performance to other HMOs, and HHSC standards and/or external Benchmarks. HHSC
will recognize HMOs that attain superior performance and/or improvement by
publicizing their achievements. For example, HHSC may post information
concerning exceptional performance on its website, where it will be available to
both stakeholders and members of the public.

6.3.1.2 AUTO-ASSIGNMENT METHODOLOGY FOR MEDICAID HMOS

HHSC may also revise its auto-assignment methodology during the Contract Period
for new Medicaid Members who do not select an HMO (Default Members). The new
assignment methodology would reward those HMOs that demonstrate superior
performance and/or improvement on one or more key dimensions of performance. In
establishing the assignment methodology, HHSC will employ a subset of the
performance indicators contained within the PERFORMANCE INDICATOR DASHBOARD. At
present, HHSC intends to recognize those HMOs that exceed the minimum geographic
access standards defined within ATTACHMENT B-1, SECTION 8 AND THE PERFORMANCE
INDICATOR DASHBOARD. HHSC may also use its assessment of HMO performance on
annual quality improvement goals (described in ATTACHMENT B-1, SECTION 8) in
developing the assignment methodology. The methodology would disproportionately
assign Default Members to the HMO(s) in a given Service Area that performed
comparably favorably on the selected performance indicators.

HHSC anticipates that it will not implement a performance-based auto-assignment
algorithm before September 1,2007. HHSC will invite HMO comments on potential
approaches prior to implementation of the new performance-based auto-assignment
algorithm.


                                                                             6-2

         SECTION 6

6.3.2 FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES

6.3.2.1 EXPERIENCE REBATE REWARD

HHSC historically has required HMOs to provide HHSC with an Experience Rebate
(see the UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, ARTICLE 10.11) when
there has been an aggregate excess of Revenues over Allowable Expenses. During
the Contract Period, should the HMO experience an aggregate excess of Revenues
over Allowable Expenses across all HMO Programs and Service Areas, HHSC will
allow the HMO to retain that portion of the aggregate excess of Revenues over
Allowable Expenses that is equal to or less than 3.5% of the total Revenue for
the period should the HMO demonstrate superior performance on selected
performance indicators. The retention of 3.5% of revenue exceeds the retention
of 3.0% of revenue that would otherwise be afforded to a HMO without
demonstrated superior performance on these performance indicators relative to
other HMOs. HHSC will develop the methodology for determining the level of
performance necessary for an HMO to retain the additional 0.5% of revenue after
consultation with HMOs. The finalized methodology will be added to the Uniform
Managed Care Manual.

HHSC will calculate the Experience Rebate Reward after it has calculated the
HMO's at-risk Capitation Rate payment, as described below in SECTION 6.3.2.2.
HHSC will calculate whether a HMO is eligible for the Experience Rebate Reward
prior to the 90-day Financial Statistical Report (FSR) filing.

HHSC anticipates that it will not implement the incentive for Rate Period 1 of
the Contract. HHSC will invite HMO comments on potential approaches prior to
implementation of the new performance-based Experience Rebate Reward.

6.3.2.2 PERFORMANCE-BASED CAPITATION RATE

Beginning in State Fiscal Year 2007 of the Contract, HHSC will place each HMO at
risk for 1% of the Capitation Rate(s). HHSC retains the right to vary the
percentage of the Capitation Rate placed at risk in a given Rate Period.

As noted in Section 6.2, HHSC will pay the HMO monthly Capitation Payments based
on the number of eligible and enrolled Members. HHSC will calculate the monthly
Capitation Payments by multiplying the number of Member months times the
applicable monthly Capitation Rate by Member rate cell. At the end of Rate
Period 2, HHSC will evaluate if the HMO has demonstrated that it has fully met
the performance expectations for which the HMO is at risk. Should the HMO fall
short on some or all of the performance expectations, HHSC will adjust a future
monthly Capitation Payment by an appropriate portion of the 1% at-risk amount.
HMOs will be able to earn variable percentages up to 100% of the 1% at-risk
Capitation Rate. HHSC's objective is that all HMOs achieve performance levels
that enable them to receive the full at-risk amount.

HHSC will determine the extent to which the HMO has met the performance
expectations by assessing the HMO's performance for each applicable HMO Program
relative to performance targets for the rate period. HHSC will conduct separate
accounting for each HMO Program's at-risk Capitation Rate amount.


                                                                             6-3

         SECTION 6

HHSC will identify no more than 10 performance indicators for either HMO
Program. Some of the performance indicators will be standard across the two HMO
Programs while others may apply to only one of the HMO Programs.

HHSC's performance indicators may include some or all of the following measures.
The specific performance indicators, periods of data collection, and associated
points are detailed in the HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL. The minimum
percentage targets identified in this section were developed based, in part, on
the HHSC HMO Program objective of ensuring access to care and quality of care,
past performance of the HHSC HMOs, and performance of Medicaid and CHIP HMOs
nationally on HEDIS and CAHPS measures of plan performance. THE PERFORMANCE
INDICATOR DASHBOARD includes a more detailed explanation.

STANDARD PERFORMANCE INDICATORS:

     1.   98% of Clean Claims are properly Adjudicated within 30 calendar days.

     2.   The Member Services Hotline abandonment rate does not exceed 7%.

     3.   The Behavioral Health Hotline abandonment rate does not exceed 5%.(1)

     4.   The Provider Services Hotline abandonment rate does not exceed 7%.

ADDITIONAL STAR PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

     1.   90% of child Members have access to at least one child-appropriate PCP
          with an Open Panel within 30 miles travel distance.

     2.   90% of adult Members have access to at least one adult-appropriate PCP
          with an Open Panel within 30 miles travel distance.

     3.   36% of age-qualified child Members receive six or more well-child
          visits (in the first 15 months of life.

     4.   56% of age-qualified child Members receive at least one well-child
          visit in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th year of life.

     5.   72% of pregnant women Members receive a prenatal care visit in the
          first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment.

ADDITIONAL CHIP PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

     1.   90% of child Members have access to at least one child-appropriate PCP
          with an Open Panel within 30 miles travel distance.

     2.   90% of child Members have access to at least one otolaryngologist
          (ENT) within 75 miles travel distance.

     3.   56% of age-qualified child Members receive at least one well-child
          visit in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th year of life

     4.   38% of adolescents receive an annual well visit.

----------
(1)  Will not apply in the Dallas Core Service Area. Points will be allocated
     proportionately over the remaining standard performance indicators.


                                                                             6-4

         SECTION 6

Failure to timely provide HHSC with necessary data related to the calculation of
the performance indicators will result in HHSC's assignment of a zero percent
performance rate for each related performance indicator.

Should Member survey-based indicators yield response rates deemed by HHSC to be
too low to yield credible data, HHSC will reapportion points across the
remaining measures.

Actual plan rates will be rounded to the nearest whole number. HHSC will
calculate performance assessment for the at-risk portion of the capitation
payments by summing all earned points and converting them to a percentage. For
example, an HMO that earns 92 points will earn 92% of the at-risk Capitation
Rate. HHSC will apply the premium assessment of 8% of the at-risk Capitation
Rate as a reduction to the monthly Capitation Payment ninety days after the end
of the contract period.

HMOs will report actual Capitation Payments received on the Financial
Statistical Report (FSR). Actual Capitation Payments received include all of the
at-risk Capitation Payment paid to the HMO. Any performance assessment based on
performance for a contract period will appear on the second final (334-day) FSR
for that contract period.

HHSC will evaluate the performance-based Capitation Rate methodology annually in
consultation with HMOs. HHSC may then modify the methodology it deems necessary
and appropriate to motivate, recognize, and reward HMOs for performance. The
methodologies for Rate Periods 1 and 2 will be included in the HHSC UNIFORM
MANAGED CARE MANUAL.

6.3.2.3 QUALITY CHALLENGE AWARD

Should one or more HMOs be unable to earn the full amount of the
performance-based at-risk portion of the Capitation Rate, HHSC will reallocate
the funds through the HMO Program's Quality Challenge Award. HHSC will use these
funds to reward HMOs that demonstrate superior clinical quality. HHSC will
determine the number of HMOs that will receive Quality Challenge Award funds
annually based on the amount of the funds to be reallocated. Separate Quality
Challenge Award payments will be made for the STAR and CHIP programs.

As with the performance-based Capitation Rate, each HMO will be evaluated
separately for each HMO Program. HHSC intends to evaluate HMO performance
annually on some combination of the following performance indicators in order to
determine which HMOs demonstrate superior clinical quality. In no event will a
distribution from the Quality Challenge Award, plus any other incentive payments
made in accordance with the HMO Contract, when combined with the Capitation Rate
payments, exceed 105% of the Capitation Rate payments to an HMO.

Information about the data collection period to be used for each indicator is
found in the HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL.


                                                                             6-5

STAR INDICATORS

     1.   asthma medication for children - ages 5-9 years;

     2.   asthma medication for children - ages 10-17 years;

     3.   cervical cancer screening;

     4.   diabetes - HbA1c control (blood test to inform Provider of the status
          of the diabetes);

     5.   mental health - 7-day follow-up after hospitalization.

CHIP INDICATORS

     1.   advising smokers to quit;

     2.   asthma medication for children - ages 5-9 years;

     3.   asthma medication for children - ages 10-17 years; and

     4.   mental health - 7-day follow-up after hospitalization.

HHSC will calculate all of the above indicators. Failure on the part of the HMO
to provide HHSC with necessary data to support the calculation of the
performance indicators on a timely basis will result in the HMO being considered
to have a performance rate of zero on the applicable indicator performance
standard(s).

HHSC will evaluate the Quality Challenge Award methodology annually in
consultation with HMOs. HHSC will make methodology modifications annually as it
deems necessary and appropriate to motivate, recognize, and reward HMOs for
superior performance based on available Quality Challenge Award funds and/or any
other financial or non-financial performance incentives HHSC has designated to
apply to the award. HHSC will include any modifications to the Quality Challenge
Award in the HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL.

6.3.2.4 REMEDIES AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

All areas of responsibility and all requirements in the Contract will be subject
to performance evaluation by HHSC. Any and all responsibilities or requirements
not fulfilled may have remedies and HHSC will assess either actual or liquidated
damages. Refer to ATTACHMENT A, HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT TERMS AND
CONDITIONS and ATTACHMENT B-5 for performance standards that carry liquidated
damage values.

7.   TRANSITION PHASE REQUIREMENTS

7.1  INTRODUCTION

This Section presents the scope of work for the Transition Phase of the
Contract, which includes those activities that must take place between the time
of Contract award and the Operational Start Date.

The Transition Phase will include a Readiness Review of each HMO, which must be
completed successfully prior to a HMO's Operational Start Date. HHSC may, at its
discretion, postpone the Operational Start Date of the Contract for any such HMO
that fails to satisfy all Transition Phase requirements.

If for any reason, a HMO does not fully meet the Readiness Review prior to the
Operational Start Date, and HHSC has not approved a delay in the Operational
Start Date or approved a delay in the HMO's compliance with the applicable
Readiness Review requirement, then HHSC shall impose remedies and either actual
or liquidated damages. If the HMO is a current HMO Contractor, HHSC may also
freeze enrollment into the HMO's plan for any of its HMO Programs. Refer to the
HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS (ATTACHMENT A) and the
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES MATRIX (ATTACHMENT B-5) for additional information.

7.2  TRANSITION PHASE SCOPE FOR HMOS

All HMOs must meet the Readiness Review requirements established by HHSC no
later than 90 days prior to Operational Start Date. HMO agrees to provide all
materials required to complete the readiness review by the dates established by
HHSC and its Contracted Readiness Review Vendor.

7.3  TRANSITION PHASE SCHEDULE AND TASKS

The Transition Phase will begin after both Parties sign the Contract. The
anticipated start date for the Transition Phase is November 15,2005. The
Transition Phase must be completed no later than the agreed upon Operational
Start Date(s) for each HMO Program and Service Area. The HMO may be subject to
liquidated damages for failure to meet the agreed upon Operational Start Date
(see Attachment B-5).

7.3.1 TRANSITION PHASE TASKS

The HMO has overall responsibility for the timely and successful completion of
each of the Transition Phase tasks. The HMO is responsible for clearly
specifying and requesting information needed from HHSC, other HHSC contractors,
and Providers in a manner that does not delay the schedule or work to be
performed.


                                                                             7-1

7.3.1.1 CONTRACT START-UP AND PLANNING

HHSC and the HMO will work together during the initial Contract start-up phase
to:

     -    define project management and reporting standards;

     -    establish communication protocols between HHSC and the HMO;

     -    establish contacts with other HHSC contractors;

     -    establish a schedule for key activities and milestones; and

     -    clarify expectations for the content and format of Contract
          Deliverables.

The HMO will be responsible for developing a written work plan, referred to as
the Transition/Implementation Plan, which will be used to monitor progress
throughout the Transition Phase. An updated and detailed
Transition/Implementation Plan will be due to HHSC.

7.3.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND KEY HMO PERSONNEL

No later than the Effective Date of the Contract, the HMO must designate and
identify Key HMO Personnel that meet the requirements in HHSC UNIFORM MANAGED
CARE CONTRACT TERMS & CONDITIONS, ARTICLE 4. The HMO will supply HHSC with
resumes of each Key HMO Personnel as well as organizational information that has
changed relative to the HMO's Proposal, such as updated job descriptions and
updated organizational charts, (including updated Management Information System
(MIS) job descriptions and an updated MIS staff organizational chart), if
applicable. If the HMO is using a Material Subcontractor(s), the HMO must also
provide the organizational chart for such Material Subcontractor(s).

7.3.1.3 FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEW

         HMO RFP, SECTION 8

achievement, and the time frames for completion, which will be incorporated into
the Contract. If HHSC and the HMO cannot agree on the Performance Improvement
Goals, measures, or time frames, HHSC will set the goals, measures, or time
frames.

For the first year, HHSC has established two goals to be used by all HMOs. A
third goal will be tailored to improve a specific area of each HMO's performance
(to be negotiated before the Operational Start Date). These goals include the
following:

     1.   NETWORK ADEQUACY AND ACCESS TO CARE, evaluated using the following
          measures:

          (a)  A specific percentage of PCPs must have an open panel; and

          (b)  A specific percentage of children and adults must have access to
               two PCPs with open panels within 30 miles.

     2.   ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, evaluated using the following
          measure:

          (a)  A specific percentage increase in the number of outpatient mental
               health providers with an open panel.

     3.   SPECIFIC HMO PERFORMANCE GOAL, evaluated using the measures negotiated
          by HHSC and the HMO.

Specific percentages for Goals 1 and 2 will be negotiated by HHSC and the HMO
before the Operational Start Date. The Specific HMO Performance Goal and the
measures used to evaluate Goal 3 will be negotiated by HHSC and the HMO before
the Operational Start Date.

The HMO must participate in semi-annual Contract Status Meetings (CSMs) with
HHSC for the primary purpose of reviewing progress toward the achievement of
annual Performance Improvement Goals and Contract requirements. HHSC may request
additional CSMs, as it deems necessary to address areas of noncompliance. HHSC
will provide the HMO with reasonable advance notice of additional CSMs,
generally at least five (5) business days.

The HMO must provide to HHSC, no later than 14 business days prior to each
semi-annual CSM, one electronic copy of a written update, detailing and
documenting the HMO's progress toward meeting the annual Performance Improvement
Goals or other areas of noncompliance.

HHSC will track HMO performance on Performance Improvement Goals. It will also
track other key facets of HMO performance through the use of a PERFORMANCE
INDICATOR DASHBOARD (SEE HHSC'S UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL). HHSC will compile
the Performance Indicator Dashboard based on HMO submissions, data from the
External Quality Review Organization (EQRO), and other data available to HHSC.
HHSC will share the Performance Indicator Dashboard with the HMO on a quarterly
basis.

8.1.2 COVERED SERVICES

The HMO is responsible for authorizing, arranging, coordinating, and providing
Covered Services in accordance with the requirements of the Contract. The HMO
must provide Medically Necessary Covered Services to all Members beginning on
the Member's date of enrollment regardless of pre-existing conditions, prior
diagnosis and/or receipt of any prior health care services. The HMO must not
impose any pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions or require Evidence
of Insurability to provide coverage to any Member.


                                                                             8-2

SUBJECT: ATTACHMENT B-1 - HHSC JOINT MEDICAID/CHIP                   Version 1.0
         HMO RFP, SECTION 8

The HMO must provide full coverage for Medically Necessary Covered Services to
all Members without regard to the Member's:

     1.   previous coverage, if any, or the reason for termination of such
          coverage;

     2.   health status;

     3.   confinement in a health care facility; or

     4.   for any other reason.

PLEASE NOTE:

(Medicaid HMOs): A Member cannot change from one Medicaid HMO to another
Medicaid HMO during an inpatient hospital stay. The HMO responsible for the
hospital charges at the start of an Inpatient Stay remains responsible for
hospital charges until the time of discharge or until such time that there is a
loss of Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid HMOs are responsible for professional
charges during every month for which the HMO receives a full capitation for a
Member.

(CHIP HMOs): If a CHIP Member's Effective Date of Coverage occurs while the CHIP
Member is confined in a hospital, HMO is responsible for the CHIP Member's costs
of Covered Services beginning on the Effective Date of Coverage. If a CHIP
Member is disenrolled while the CHIP Member is confined in a hospital, HMO's
responsibility for the CHIP Member's costs of Covered Services terminates on the
Date of Disenrollment.

The HMO must not practice discriminatory selection, or encourage segregation
among the total group of eligible Members by excluding, seeking to exclude, or
otherwise discriminating against any group or class of individuals.

Covered Services for all Medicaid HMO Members are listed in ATTACHMENT B-2 OF
THE CONTRACT. As noted in ATTACHMENT B-2, all Medicaid HMOs must provide Covered
Services described in the most recent TEXAS MEDICAID PROVIDER PROCEDURES MANUAL
(Provider Procedures Manual), the THSTEPS MANUAL (a supplement to the Provider
Procedures Manual), and in all TEXAS MEDICAID BULLETINS, which update the
Provider Procedures Manual except for those services identified in SECTION
8.2.2.8 as non-capitated services. A description of CHIP Covered Services and
exclusions is provided in ATTACHMENT B-2 OF THE CONTRACT.

Covered Services are subject to change due to changes in federal and state law,
changes in Medicaid or CHIP policy, and changes in medical practice, clinical
protocols, or technology.

8.1.2.1 VALUE-ADDED SERVICES

HMOs may propose additional services for coverage. These are referred to as
"Value-added Services." Value-added Services must be actual health care services
or benefits rather than gifts, incentives, educational classes or health
assessments. Temporary phones, cell phones, additional transportation benefits,
and extra home health services may be Value-added Services, if approved by HHSC.
Best practice approaches to delivering Covered Services are not considered
Value-added Services.


                                                                             8-3

SUBJECT: ATTACHMENT B-1 - HHSC JOINT MEDICAID/CHIP                   Version 1.0
         HMO RFP, SECTION 8

If offered, Value-added Services must be offered to all mandatory HMO Members
within the applicable HMO Program and Service Area. Value-added Services do not
need to be consistent across more than one HMO Program or across more than one
Service Area. Value-added Services that are approved by HHSC during the
contracting process will be included in the Contract's scope of services.

The HMO must provide Value-added Services at no additional cost to HHSC. The HMO
must not pass on the cost of the Value-added Services to Providers. The HMO must
specify the conditions and parameters regarding the delivery of the Value-added
Services in the HMO's Marketing Materials and Member Handbook, and must clearly
describe any limitations or conditions specific to the Value-added Services.

Value-added Services can be added or removed only by written amendment of the
Contract one time per fiscal year to be effective September 1 of the fiscal
year, except when services are amended by HHSC during the fiscal year. This will
allow HHSC to coordinate with annual revisions to HHSC's HMO Comparison Charts
for Members. A HMO's request to add or delete a Value-added Service must be
submitted to HHSC by May 1 of each year to be effective for the following
contract period. (See ATTACHMENT B-3, VALUE-ADDED SERVICES).

A HMO's request to add a Value-added Service must:

     1.   Define and describe the proposed Value-added Service;

     2.   Specify the Service Areas and HMO Programs for the proposed
          Value-added Service;

     3.   Identify the category or group of mandatory Members eligible to
          receive the Value-added Service if it is a type of service that is not
          appropriate for all mandatory Members;

     4.   Note any limits or restrictions that apply to the Value-added Service;

     5.   Identify the Providers responsible for providing the Value-added
          Service;

     6.   Describe how the HMO will identify the Value-added Service in
          administrative (Encounter) data;

     7.   Propose how and when the HMO will notify Providers and mandatory
          Members about the availability of such Value-added Service;

     8.   Describe how a Member may obtain or access the Value-added Service;
          and

     9.   Include a statement that the HMO would provide such Value-added
          Service for at least 12 months from the approval date of the
          Value-added Service.

A HMO cannot include a Value-added Service in any material distributed to
mandatory Members or prospective mandatory Members until the Parties have
amended the Contract to include that Value-added Service. If a Value-added
Service is deleted by amendment, the HMO must notify each mandatory Member that
the service is no longer available through the HMO. The HMO must also revise all
materials distributed to prospective mandatory Members to reflect the change in
Value-added Services.

8.1.2.2 CASE-BY-CASE ADDED SERVICES

The HMO may offer additional benefits that are outside the scope of services to
individual Members on a case-by-case basis, based on Medical Necessity,
cost-effectiveness, the wishes of the Member/Member's family, and the potential
for improved health status of the Member.


                                                                             8-4

8.1.3 ACCESS TO CARE

All Covered Services must be available to Members on a timely basis in
accordance with medically appropriate guidelines, and consistent with generally
accepted practice parameters, requirements in this Contract. The HMO must comply
with the access requirements as established by the Texas Department of Insurance
(TDI) for all HMOs doing business in Texas, except as otherwise required by this
Contract. Medicaid HMOs must be responsive to the possibility of increased
Members due to the phase-out of the PCCM model in Service Areas where adequate
HMO coverage exists.

The HMO must provide coverage for Emergency Services to Members 24 hours a day
and 7 days a week, without regard to prior authorization or the Emergency
Service provider's contractual relationship with the HMO. The HMO's policy and
procedures, Covered Services, claims adjudication methodology, and reimbursement
performance for Emergency Services must comply with all applicable state and
federal laws and regulations, whether the provider is in-network or
Out-of-Network. A HMO is not responsible for payment for unauthorized
non-emergency services provided to a Member by Out-of-Network providers.

The HMO must also have an emergency and crisis Behavioral Health Services
Hotline available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, toll-free throughout the
Service Area. The Behavioral Health Services Hotline must meet the requirements
described in SECTION 8.1.15. For Medicaid Members, a HMO must provide coverage
for Emergency Services in compliance with 42 C.F.R. Section 438.114, and as
described in more detail in SECTION 8.2.2.1. The HMO may arrange Emergency
Services and crisis Behavioral Health Services through mobile crisis teams.

For CHIP Members, Emergency Services, including emergency Behavioral Health
Services, must be provided in accordance with the Texas Insurance Code and TDI
regulations.

The HMO must require, and make best efforts to ensure, that PCPs are accessible
to Members 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and that its Network Primary Care
Providers (PCPs) have after-hours telephone availability that is consistent
with, SECTION 8.1.4.

The HMO must provide that if Medically Necessary Covered Services are not
available through Network physicians or other Providers, the HMO must, upon the
request of a Network physician or other Provider, within the time appropriate to
the circumstances relating to the delivery of the services and the condition of
the patient, but in no event to exceed five business days after receipt of
reasonably requested documentation, allow a referral to a non-network physician
or provider. The HMO must fully reimburse the non-network provider in accordance
with the Out-of-Network methodology for Medicaid as defined by HHSC, and for
CHIP, at the usual and customary rate defined by TDI in 28 T.A.C. Section
11.506.

The Member will not be responsible for any payment for Medically Necessary
Covered Services, other than HHSC-specified co-payments for CHIP Members, where
applicable.


                                                                             8-5

8.1.3.1 WAITING TIMES FOR APPOINTMENTS

Through its Provider Network composition and management, the HMO must ensure
that appointments for the following types of Covered Services are provided
within the time frames specified below. In all cases below, "day" is defined as
a calendar day.

     1.   Emergency Services must be provided upon Member presentation at the
          service delivery site, including at non-network and out-of-area
          facilities;

     2.   Urgent care, including urgent specialty care, must be provided within
          24 hours of request.

     3.   Routine primary care must be provided within 14 days of request;

     4.   Initial outpatient behavioral health visits must be provided within 14
          days of request;

     5.   Routine specialty care referrals must be provided within 30 days of
          request;

     6.   Pre-natal care must be provided within 14 days of request, except for
          high-risk pregnancies or new Members in the third trimester, for whom
          an appointment must be offered within five days, or immediately, if an
          emergency exists;

     7.   Preventive health services for adults must be offered to a Member
          within 90 days of request; and

     8.   Preventive health services for children, including well-child
          check-ups should be offered to Members in accordance with the American
          Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) periodicity schedule. Please note that for
          Medicaid Members, HMOs should use the THSteps Program modifications to
          the AAP periodicity schedule. For newly enrolled Members under age 21,
          overdue or upcoming well-child checkups, including THSteps medical
          checkups, should be offered as soon as practicable, but in no case
          later than 14 days of enrollment for newborns, and no later than 60
          days of enrollment for all other eligible child Members.

8.1.3.2 ACCESS TO NETWORK PROVIDERS

The HMO's Network shall have within its Network, PCPs in sufficient numbers, and
with sufficient capacity, to provide timely access to regular and preventive
pediatric care and THSteps services to all child Members in accordance with the
waiting times for appointments in SECTION 8.1.3.1.

PCP ACCESS: At a minimum, the HMO must ensure that all Members have access to an
age-appropriate PCP in the Provider Network with an Open Panel within 30 miles
of the Member's residence. For the purposes of assessing compliance with this
requirement, an internist who provides primary care to adults only is not
considered an age-appropriate PCP choice for a Member under age 21, and a
pediatrician is not considered an age-appropriate choice for a Member age 21 and
over.

OB/GYN ACCESS: At a minimum, the HMO must ensure that all female Members have
access to an OB/GYN in the Provider Network with an Open Panel within 75 miles
of the Member's residence. (If the OB/GYN is acting as the Member's PCP, the HMO

Members to select an OB/GYN within its Provider Network. A female Member who
selects an OB/GYN must be allowed direct access to the OB/GYN's health care
services without a referral from the Member's PCP or a prior authorization. A
pregnant Member with 12 weeks or less remaining before the expected delivery


                                                                             8-6

Out-of-Network.

OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDER ACCESS: At a minimum, the HMO must
ensure that all Members have access to an outpatient Behavioral Health Service
Provider in the Network with an Open Panel within 75 miles of the Member's
residence. Outpatient Behavioral Health Service Providers must include Masters
and Doctorate-level trained practitioners practicing independently or at
community mental health centers, other clinics or at outpatient hospital
departments. A Qualified Mental Health Provider (QMHP), as defined and
credentialed by the Texas Department of State Health Services standards (T.A.C.
Title 25, Part I, Chapter 412), is an acceptable outpatient behavioral health
provider as long as the QMHP is working under the authority of an MHMR entity
and is supervised by a licensed mental health professional or physician.

OTHER SPECIALIST PHYSICIAN ACCESS: At a minimum, the HMO must ensure that all
Members have access to a Network specialist physician with an Open Panel within
75 miles of the Member's residence for common medical specialties. For adult

orthopedics, urology, and ophthalmology. For child Members, common medical
specialties shall include orthopedics and otolaryngology.

HOSPITAL ACCESS: The HMO must ensure that all Members have access to an Acute
Care hospital in the Provider Network within 30 miles of the Member's residence.

ALL OTHER COVERED SERVICES, EXCEPT FOR SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE MEMBER'S
RESIDENCE: At a minimum, the HMO must ensure that all Members have access to at
least one Network Provider with an Open Panel for each of the remaining Covered
Services described in ATTACHMENT B-2, within 75 miles of the Member's residence.
This access requirement includes, but is not limited to, specialists, specialty
hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, diagnostic and therapeutic services, and
single or limited service health care physicians or Providers.

The HMO is not precluded from making arrangements with physicians or providers
outside the HMO's Service Area for Members to receive a higher level of skill or
specialty than the level available within the Service Area, including but not
limited to, treatment of cancer, burns, and cardiac diseases. HHSC may consider
exceptions to the above access-related requirements when an HMO has established,
through utilization data provided to HHSC, that a normal pattern for securing
health care services within an area does not meet these standards, or when an
HMO is providing care of a higher skill level or specialty than the level which
is available within the Service Area such as, but not limited to, treatment of
cancer, burns, and cardiac diseases.

8.1.3.3 MONITORING ACCESS

The HMO is required to systematically and regularly verify that Covered Services
furnished by Network Providers are available and accessible to Members in
compliance with the standards described in SECTIONS 8.1.3.1 AND 8.1.3.2, and for
Covered Services furnished by PCPs, the standards described in SECTION 8.1.4.2.


                                                                             8-7

residence if the HMO does not include such hospitals in its Provider Network.
Provider Directories, Member materials, and Marketing materials must clearly
distinguish between hospitals designated as Children's Hospitals and hospitals
that have designated children's units.

TRAUMA: The HMO must ensure Members access to Texas Department of State Health
Services (TDSHS) designated Level I and Level II trauma centers within the State
or hospitals meeting the equivalent level of trauma care in the HMO's Service
Area, or in close proximity to such Service

(2) working days from the day the Provider identifies the Member. The HMO must
use written educational materials developed or approved by the Department of
Assistive and Rehabilitative Services - Division for Early Childhood
Intervention Services for these "child find" activities. Eligibility for ECI
services will be determined by the local ECI program using the criteria
contained in 40 T.A.C. Section 108.25.

that consists of the ECI Case Manager/Service Coordinator, the Member/family,
and other professionals who participated in the Member's evaluation or are
providing direct services to the Member, and may include the Member's Primary
Care Physician (PCP) with parental consent. The IFSP identifies the Member's
present level of development based on assessment, describes the services to be
provided to the child to meet the needs of the child and the family, and
identifies the person or persons responsible for each service required by the
plan. The IFSP shall be transmitted by the ECI Provider to the HMO and the PCP
with parental consent to enhance coordination of the plan of care. The IFSP may
be included in the Member's medical record.


                                                                            8-25

Covered Services to meet the special preventive, primary Acute Care, and
specialty health care needs appropriate for treatment of the individual Member's
condition(s).

The HMO must provide access to identified PCPs and specialty care Providers with
experience serving MSHCN. Such Providers must be board-qualified or

For services to CSHCN, the HMO must have Network PCPs and specialty care
Providers that have demonstrated experience with CSHCN in pediatric specialty
centers such as children's hospitals, teaching hospitals, and tertiary care

package of care in which primary, Acute Care, and specialty service needs are
met through a Service Plan that is understandable to the Member, or, when
applicable, the Member's legal guardian.

The HMO is responsible for providing Service Management to develop a Service
Plan and ensure MSHCN, including CSHCN, have access to treatment by a
multidisciplinary team when the Member's PCP determines the treatment is
Medically Necessary, or to avoid separate and fragmented evaluations and service
plans. The team must include both physician and non-physician providers
determined to be necessary by the Member's PCP for the comprehensive treatment
of the Member. The team must:

     1.   Participate in hospital discharge planning;

     2.   Participate in pre-admission hospital planning for non-emergency
          hospitalizations;

     3.   Develop specialty care and support service recommendations to be
          incorporated into the Service Plan; and

     4.   Provide information to the Member, or when applicable, the Member's
          legal guardian concerning the specialty care recommendations.

MSHCN, their families, or their health providers may request Service Management
from the HMO. The HMO must make an assessment of whether Service Management is
needed and furnish Service Management when appropriate. The HMO may also
recommend to a MSHCN, or to a CSHCN's family, that Service Management be
furnished if the HMO determines that Service Management would benefit the
Member.

The HMO must provide information and education in its Member Handbook and
Provider Manual about the care and treatment available in the HMO's plan for
Members with Special Health Care Needs, including the availability of Service
Management.

The following provisions apply to any HMO participating in the STAR HMO Program.

8.2.1 CONTINUITY OF CARE AND OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS

The HMO must ensure that the care of newly enrolled Members is not disrupted or
interrupted. The HMO must take special care to provide continuity in the care of
newly enrolled Members whose health or behavioral health condition has been
treated by specialty care providers or whose health could be placed in jeopardy
if Medically Necessary Covered Services are disrupted or interrupted.

The HMO must allow pregnant Members with 12 weeks or less remaining before the
expected delivery date to remain under the care of the Member's current OB/GYN
through the Member's postpartum checkup, even if the provider is Out-of-Network.
If a Member wants to change her OB/GYN to one who is in the Network, she must be
allowed to do so if the Provider to whom she wishes to transfer agrees to accept
her in the last trimester of pregnancy.

The HMO must pay a Member's existing Out-of-Network providers for Medically
Necessary Covered Services until the Member's records, clinical information and
care can be transferred to a Network Provider, or until such time as the Member

Out-of-Network providers must be made within the time period required for
Network Providers. The HMO must comply with out-of-network provider
reimbursement rules as adopted by HHSC.

policies and procedures must be consistent with the prudent layperson definition
of an Emergency Medical Condition and the claims adjudication processes required
under the Contract and 42 C.F.R. Section 438.114.

The HMO must pay for the professional, facility, and ancillary services that are
Medically Necessary to perform the medical screening examination and
stabilization of a Member presenting with an Emergency Medical Condition or an
Emergency Behavioral Health Condition to the hospital emergency department, 24
hours a day, 7 days a week, rendered by either the HMO's Network or
Out-of-Network providers.

The HMO cannot require prior authorization as a condition for payment for an
Emergency Medical Condition, an Emergency Behavioral Health Condition, or labor
and delivery. The HMO cannot limit what constitutes an Emergency Medical
Condition on the basis of lists of diagnoses or symptoms. The HMO cannot refuse
to cover Emergency Services based on the emergency room provider, hospital, or

and treatment within 10 calendar days of presentation for Emergency Services.
The HMO may not hold the Member who has an Emergency Medical Condition liable
for payment of subsequent screening and treatment needed to diagnose the
specific condition or stabilize the patient. The HMO must accept the emergency
physician or provider's determination of when the Member is sufficiently
stabilized for transfer or discharge.

     2.   The HMO cannot be contacted; or

     3.   The HMO representative and the treating physician cannot reach an

          treating physician the opportunity to consult with a Network physician
          and the treating physician may continue with care of the patient until
          an HMO physician is reached. The HMO's financial responsibility ends

          assumes responsibility for the Member's care; the HMO physician
          assumes responsibility for the Member's care through transfer; the HMO

     1.   Agree to accept the HMO's Provider reimbursement rate for the provider
          type; and

     2.   Meet the standard credentialing requirements of the HMO, provided that
          lack of board certification or accreditation by the Joint Commission
          on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) is not the sole

payments from the HMO in an amount that is equal to or greater than the HMO's
payment terms for other Providers providing the same or similar services.

The HMO must submit monthly FQHC and RHC encounter and payment reports to all

UNIFORM MANAGED CARE MANUAL. The FQHC and RHC must validate the encounter and
payment information contained in the report(s). The HMO and the FQHC/RHC must
both sign the report(s) after each party agrees that it accurately reflects

specialty as the appealing Provider. HHSC reserves the right to amend this
process to include an independent review process established by HHSC for final
determination on these disputes.

A Member must file a request for an Appeal with the HMO within 30 days from
receipt of the notice of the Action. The HMO is subject to remedies, including
liquidated damages, if at least 98 percent of Member Appeals are not resolved
within 30 days of receipt of the Appeal by the HMO. Please see the UNIFORM

intended effective date of the proposed Action. The HMO must designate an
officer who has primary responsibility for ensuring that Appeals are resolved in
compliance with written policy and within the 30-day time limit.

the Appeals process in the Member Handbook. The HMO must maintain and publish in
the Member Handbook at least one local and one toll-free telephone number with
TTY/TDD and interpreter capabilities for requesting an Appeal of an Action.

The HMO's process must require that every oral Appeal received must be confirmed
by a written, signed Appeal by the Member or his or her representative, unless
the Member or his or her representative requests an expedited resolution. All
Appeals must be recorded in a written record and logged with the following
details:

     1)   Date notice is sent;

     2)   Effective date of the Action;

initial written or oral request for Appeal. The timeframe for a standard Appeal
may be extended up to 14 calendar days if the Member or his or her
representative requests an extension; or the HMO shows that there is a need for
additional information and how the delay is in the Member's interest. If the
timeframe is extended, the HMO must give the Member written notice of the reason
for delay if the Member had not requested the delay. The HMO must designate an
officer who has primary responsibility for ensuring that Appeals are resolved
within these timeframes and in accordance with the HMO's written policies.

During the Appeal process, the HMO must provide the Member a reasonable
opportunity to present evidence and any allegations of fact or law in person as
well as in writing. The HMO must inform the Member of the time available for
providing this information and that, in the case of an expedited resolution,

The HMO must provide the Member and his or her representative opportunity,
before and during the Appeal process, to examine the Member's case file,
including medical records and any other documents considered during the Appeal
process. The HMO must include, as parties to the Appeal, the Member and his or
her representative or the legal representative of a deceased Member's estate.

     4.   The original period covered by the original authorization has not
          expired; and

     5.   The Member requests an extension of the benefits.

If, at the Member's request, the HMO continues or reinstates the Member's
benefits while the Appeal is pending, the benefits must be continued until one
of the following occurs:

     1.   The Member withdraws the Appeal;

     2.   Ten (10) days pass after the HMO mails the notice resolving the Appeal
          against the Member, unless the Member, within the 10-day timeframe,
          has requested a Fair Hearing with continuation of benefits until a
          Fair Hearing decision can be reached; or

     3.   A state Fair Hearing officer issues a hearing decision adverse to the
          Member or the time period or service limits of a previously authorized
          service has been met.

In accordance with 42 C.F.R. Section 438.420(d), if the final resolution of the
Appeal is adverse to the Member and upholds the HMO's Action, then to the extent
that the services were furnished to comply with the Contract, the HMO may
recover such costs from the Member.

If the HMO or State Fair Hearing Officer reverses a decision to deny, limit, or
delay services that were not furnished while the Appeal was pending, the HMO
must authorize or provide the disputed services promptly and as expeditiously as
the Member's health condition requires.

If the HMO or State Fair Hearing Officer reverses a decision to deny
authorization of services and the Member received the disputed services while
the Appeal was pending, the HMO is responsible for the payment of services.

The HMO is prohibited from discriminating or taking punitive action against a
Member or his or her representative for making an Appeal.

8.2.7.3 EXPEDITED MEDICAID HMO APPEALS

In accordance with 42 C.F.R. Section 438.410, the HMO must establish and
maintain an expedited review process for Appeals, when the HMO determines (for a
request from a Member) or the provider indicates (in making the request on the
Member's behalf or supporting the Member's request) that taking the time for a
standard resolution could seriously jeopardize the Member's life or health. The
HMO must follow all Appeal requirements for standard Member Appeals as


                                                                            8-60

Members must exhaust the HMO's Expedited Appeal process before making a request
for an expedited Fair Hearing. After the HMO receives the request for an
Expedited Appeal, it must hear an approved request for a Member to have an
Expedited Appeal and notify the Member of the outcome of the Expedited Appeal
within 3 business days, except that the HMO must complete investigation and
resolution of an Appeal relating to an ongoing emergency or denial of continued
hospitalization: (1) in accordance with the medical or dental immediacy of the
case; and (2) not later than one (1) business day after receiving the Member's
request for Expedited Appeal is received.

Except for an Appeal relating to an ongoing emergency or denial of continued
hospitalization, the timeframe for notifying the Member of the outcome of the
Expedited Appeal may be extended up to 14 calendar days if the Member requests
an extension or the HMO shows (to the satisfaction of HHSC, upon HHSC's request)
that there is a need for additional information and how the delay is in the
Member's interest. If the timeframe is extended, the HMO must give the Member
written notice of the reason for delay if the Member had not requested the
delay.

If the decision is adverse to the Member, the HMO must follow the procedures
relating to the notice in SECTION 8.2.7.5. The HMO is responsible for notifying
the Member of his or her right to access an expedited Fair Hearing from HHSC.
The HMO will be responsible for providing documentation to the State and the
Member, indicating how the decision was made, prior to HHSC's expedited Fair
Hearing.

The HMO is prohibited from discriminating or taking punitive action against a
Member or his or her representative for requesting an Expedited Appeal. The HMO
must ensure that punitive action is neither taken against a provider who
requests an expedited resolution or supports a Member's request.

If the HMO denies a request for expedited resolution of an Appeal, it must:

          (1)  Transfer the Appeal to the timeframe for standard resolution, and

          (2)  Make a reasonable effort to give the Member prompt oral notice of
               the denial, and follow up within two (2) calendar days with a
               written notice.

8.2.7.4 ACCESS TO FAIR HEARING FOR MEDICAID MEMBERS

The HMO must inform Members that they have the right to access the Fair Hearing
process at any time during the Appeal system provided by the HMO. In the case of
an expedited Fair Hearing process, the HMO must inform the Member that he or she
must first exhaust the HMO's internal Expedited Appeal process prior to filing
an Expedited Fair Hearing. The HMO must notify Members that they may be
represented by an authorized representative in the Fair Hearing process.


                                                                            8-61

community resources available to meet Member needs that are not available from
the HMO as Medicaid Covered Services.

8.2.8 ADDITIONAL MEDICAID BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVISIONS

8.2.8.1 LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITY (LMHA)

Assessment to determine eligibility for rehabilitative and targeted DSHS case
management services is a function of the LMHA. Covered Services must be provided
to Members with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) and severe emotional
disturbance (SED), when Medically Necessary, whether or not they are also
receiving targeted case management or rehabilitation services through the LMHA.

The HMO must enter into written agreements with all LMHAs in the Service Area
that describe the process(es) that the HMO and LMHAs will use to coordinate
services for STAR Members with SPMI or SED. The agreements will:

     1.   Describe the Behavioral Health Services indicated in detail in the
          PROVIDER PROCEDURES MANUAL and in the TEXAS MEDICAID BULLETIN, include
          the amount, duration, and scope of basic and Value-added Services, and
          the HMO's responsibility to provide these services;

     2.   Describe criteria, protocols, procedures and instrumentation for
          referral of STAR Members from and to the HMO and the LMHA;

     3.   Describe processes and procedures for referring Members with SPMI or
          SED to the LMHA for assessment and determination of eligibility for
          rehabilitation or targeted case management services;

     4.   Describe how the LMHA and the HMO will coordinate providing Behavioral
          Health Services to Members with SPMI or SED;

     5.   Establish clinical consultation procedures between the HMO and LMHA
          including consultation to effect referrals and on-going consultation
          regarding the Member's progress;


                                                                            8-64

         SECTION 8

     6.   Establish procedures to authorize release and exchange of clinical
          treatment records;

     7.   Establish procedures for coordination of assessment, intake/triage,
          utilization review/utilization management and care for persons with
          SPMI or SED;

     8.   Establish procedures for coordination of inpatient psychiatric
          services (including Court-ordered Commitment of Members under 21) in
          state psychiatric facilities within the LMHA's catchment area;

     9.   Establish procedures for coordination of emergency and urgent services
          to Members;

     10.  Establish procedures for coordination of care and transition of care
          for new Members who are receiving treatment through the LMHA; and

     11.  Establish that when Members are receiving Behavioral Health Services
          from the Local Mental Health Authority that the HMO is using the same
          UM guidelines as those prescribed for use by local mental health
          authorities by DSHS which are published at:
          http://www.mhmr.state.tx.us/centraloffice/behavioralhealthservices/
          RDMClinGuide.html.

The HMO must offer licensed practitioners of the healing arts (defined in 25
T.A.C., Part 2, Chapter 419, Subchapter L), who are part of the Member's
treatment team for rehabilitation services, the opportunity to participate in
the HMO's Network. The practitioner must agree to accept the HMO's Provider
reimbursement rate, meet the credentialing requirements, and comply with all the
terms and conditions of the HMO's standard Provider contract.

HMOs must allow Members receiving rehabilitation services to choose the licensed
practitioners of the healing arts who are currently a part of the Member's
treatment team for rehabilitation services to provide Covered Services. If the
Member chooses to receive these services from licensed practitioners of the
healing arts who are part of the Member's rehabilitation services treatment team
but are not part of the HMO's Network, the HMO must reimburse the Local Mental
Health Authority through Out-of-Network reimbursement arrangements.

Nothing in this section diminishes the potential for the Local Mental Health
Authority to seek best value for rehabilitative services by providing these
services under arrangement, where possible, as specified is 25 T.A.C.
Section 419.455.

8.2.9 THIRD PARTY LIABILITY AND RECOVERY

Medicaid HMOs are responsible for establishing a plan and process for recovering
costs for services that should have been paid through a third party in
accordance with State and Federal law and regulations. To recognize this
requirement, capitation payments to the HMOs are reduced by the projected amount
of TPR that the HMO is expected to recover.

The HMOs must provide required reports as stated in SECTION 8.1.17.2, Financial
Reporting Requirements.

After 120-days from the date of service on any claim, encounter, or other
Medicaid related payment by the HMO subject to Third Party Recovery, HHSC may
attempt recovery independent of any HMO action. HHSC will retain, in full, all
funds received as a result of the state initiated recovery or subrogation
action.


                                                                            8-65

8.2.12 ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

Federal and state law require HMOs and providers to maintain written policies
and procedures for informing all adult Members 18 years of age and older about
their rights to refuse, withhold or withdraw medical treatment and mental health
treatment through advance directives (see Social Security Act Section
1902(a)(57) and Section 1903(m)(1)(A)). The HMO's policies and procedures must
include written notification to Members and comply with provisions contained in
42 C.F.R. Section 434.28 and 42 C.F.R. Section 489, Subpart I, relating to
advance directives for all hospitals, critical access hospitals, skilled nursing
facilities, home health agencies, providers of home health care, providers of
personal care services and hospices, as well as the following state laws and
rules:

     1.   A Member's right to self-determination in making health care
          decisions;

     2.   The Advance Directives Act, Chapter 166, Texas Health and Safety Code,
          which includes:

               a.   A Member's right to execute an advance written directive to
                    physicians and family or surrogates, or to make a
                    non-written directive to administer, withhold or withdraw
                    life-sustaining treatment in the event of a terminal or
                    irreversible condition;

               b.   A Member's right to make written and non-written
                    out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders;

               c.   A Member's right to execute a Medical Power of Attorney to
                    appoint an agent to make health care decisions on the
                    Member's behalf if the Member becomes incompetent; and

     3.   The Declaration for Mental Health Treatment, Chapter 137, Texas Civil
          Practice and Remedies Code, which includes: a Member's right to
          execute a Declaration for Mental Health Treatment in a document making
          a declaration of preferences or instructions regarding mental health
          treatment.

The HMO must maintain written policies for implementing a Member's advance
directive. Those policies must include a clear and precise statement of
limitation if the HMO or a Provider cannot or will not implement a Member's
advance directive.

The HMO cannot require a Member to execute or issue an advance directive as a
condition of receiving health care services. The HMO cannot discriminate against
a Member based on whether or not the Member has executed or issued an advance
directive.

The HMO's policies and procedures must require the HMO and subcontractors to
comply with the requirements of state and federal law relating to advance
directives. The HMO must provide education and training to employees and Members
on issues concerning advance directives.

All materials provided to Members regarding advance directives must be written
at a 7th - 8th grade reading comprehension level, except where a provision is
required by state or federal law and the provision cannot be reduced or modified
to a 7th - 8th grade reading level because it is a reference to the law or is
required to be included "as written" in the state or federal law.


                                                                            8-68

8.4  ADDITIONAL CHIP SCOPE OF WORK

The following provisions only apply to HMOs participating in CHIP.

8.4.1 CHIP PROVIDER NETWORK

In each Service Area, the HMO must seek to obtain the participation in its
Provider Network of CHIP Significant Traditional Providers (STPs), defined by
HHSC as PCP Providers currently serving the CHIP population and DSH hospitals.
The Procurement Library includes CHIP STPs by Service Area.

The HMO must give STPs the opportunity to participate in its Network if the
STPs:

     1.   Agree to accept the HMO's Provider reimbursement rate for the provider
          type; and

     2.   Meet the standard credentialing requirements of the HMO, provided that
          lack of board certification or accreditation by the Joint Commission
          on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) is not the sole
          grounds for exclusion from the Provider Network.

8.4.2 CHIP PROVIDER COMPLAINT AND APPEALS

CHIP Provider Complaints and Appeals are subject to disposition consistent with
the Texas Insurance Code and any applicable TDI regulations

8.4.3 CHIP MEMBER COMPLAINT AND APPEAL PROCESS

CHIP Member Complaints and Appeals are subject to disposition consistent with
the Texas Insurance Code and any applicable TDI regulations. HHSC will require
the HMO to resolve Complaints and Appeals (that are not elevated to TDI) within
30 days from the date the Complaint or Appeal is received. The HMO is subject to
remedies, including liquidated damages, if at least 98 percent of Member
Complaints or Member Appeals are not resolved within 30 days of receipt of the
Complaint or Appeal by the HMO. Please see the UNIFORM MANAGED CARE CONTRACT
TERMS & CONDITIONS and ATTACHMENT B-5, DELIVERABLES/LIQUIDATED DAMAGES MATRIX.

8.4.4 DENTAL COVERAGE FOR CHIP MEMBERS

The HMO is not responsible for reimbursing dental providers for preventive and
therapeutic dental services obtained by CHIP Members. However, medical and/or
hospital charges, such as anesthesia, that are necessary in order for CHIP
Members to access standard therapeutic dental services, are Covered Services for
CHIP Members. The HMO must provide access to facilities and physician services
that are necessary to support the dentist who is providing dental services to a
CHIP Member under general anesthesia or intravenous (IV) sedation.

The HMO must inform Network facilities, anesthesiologists, and PCPs what
authorization procedures are required, and how Providers are to be reimbursed
for the preoperative evaluations by the PCP and/or anesthesiologist and for the
facility services. For dental-related medical Emergency Services, the HMO must
reimburse in-network and Out-of-Network providers in accordance with federal and
state laws, rules, and regulations.

Contractor, as required, or the data is not HIPAA compliant, HHSC reserves the
right to hire an independent contractor to assist HHSC in obtaining and
transferring all the required data and to ensure that all the data are HIPAA
compliant. The reasonable cost of providing these services will be the
responsibility of the HMO.

9.3  TURNOVER SERVICES

Six months prior to the end of the Contract Period, including any extensions to
such Period, the HMO must propose a Turnover Plan covering the possible turnover
of the records and information maintained to either the State or a successor
HMO. The Turnover Plan must be a comprehensive document detailing the proposed
schedule, activities, and resource requirements associated with the turnover
tasks. The Turnover Plan must be approved by HHSC.

As part of the Turnover Plan, the HMO must provide HHSC with copies of all
relevant Member and service data, documentation, or other pertinent information
necessary, as determined by the HHSC, for HHSC or a subsequent Contractor to
assume the operational activities successfully. This includes correspondence,
documentation of ongoing outstanding issues, and other operations support
documentation. The plan will describe the HMO's approach and schedule for
transfer of all data and operational support information, as applicable. The
information must be supplied in media and format specified by the State and
according to the schedule approved by the State.

HHSC is not limited or restricted in the ability to require additional
information from the HMO or modify the turnover schedule as necessary.


                                                                             9-1

9.4  POST-TURNOVER SERVICES

Thirty (30) days following turnover of operations, the HMO must provide HHSC
with a Turnover Results report documenting the completion and results of each
step of the Turnover Plan. Turnover will not be considered complete until this
document is approved by HHSC.

If the HMO does not provide the required relevant data and reference tables,
documentation, or other pertinent information necessary for HHSC or the
subsequent Contractor to assume the operational activities successfully, the HMO
agrees to reimburse the State for all reasonable costs, including, but not
limited to, transportation, lodging, and subsistence for all state and federal
representatives, or their agents, to carry out their inspection, audit, review,
analysis, reproduction and transfer functions at the location(s) of such
records.

The HMO also agrees to pay any and all additional costs incurred by the State
that are the result of the HMO's failure to provide the requested records, data
or documentation within the time frames agreed to in the Turnover Plan.

The HMO must maintain all files and records related to Members and Providers for
five years after the date of final payment under the Contract or until the
resolution of all litigation, claims, financial management review or audit
pertaining to the Contract, whichever is longer. The HMO agrees to repay any
valid, undisputed audit exceptions taken by HHSC in any audit of the Contract.

STAR COVERED SERVICES

The following is a non-exhaustive, high-level listing of Acute Care Covered
Services included under the STAR Medicaid managed care program.

Medicaid HMO Contractors are responsible for providing a benefit package to
Members that includes all medically necessary services covered under the
traditional, fee-for-service Medicaid programs except for Non-capitated Services
provided to STAR Members outside of the HMO capitation and listed in Attachment
B-1, SECTION 8.2.2.8. Medicaid HMO Contractors must coordinate care for Members
for these Non-capitated Services so that Members have access to a full range of
medically necessary Medicaid services, both capitated and non-capitated. A
Contractor may elect to offer additional acute care Value-added Services.

The STAR Members are provided with three enhanced benefits compared to the
traditional, fee-for-service Medicaid coverage:

     1)   waiver of the three-prescription per month limit;

     2)   waiver of the 30-day spell-of-illness limitation under
          fee-for-services; and

     3)   inclusion of an annual adult well check for patients 21 years of age
          and over.

Medicaid HMO Contractors are responsible for providing a benefit package to
Members that includes the waiver of the 30-day spell-of-illness limitation under
