Employer may direct Employee not to report to work and/or enter Employer&#146;s office premises or

Employment Non-Compete Period, Employee shall receive payments equal to the base salary payments
Employee would have received if Employee had been in Employer&#146;s employ during the Post Employment
Non-Compete Period (the Non-Compete Payments). These Non-Compete Payments will be made on the same
