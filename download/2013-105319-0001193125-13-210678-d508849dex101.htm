announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future
delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall not incur any liability in case any
such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made
pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of the Collateral or any part thereof at any such sale or other disposition, and the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the Required Lenders,

compensation to the Grantors and solely upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default) to use, license or sublicense any of the Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor,

purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the &#147;<U>Federal Securities Laws</U>&#148;) with respect to any disposition of the Pledged Collateral permitted hereunder. Each Grantor

also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Collateral could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Administrative Agent in any attempt to
