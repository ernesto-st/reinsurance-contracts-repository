                               FUNDING OF ADVANCES

     Section 3.1.  Advances.  Subject to the  conditions  and terms hereof,  the

Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (i) no advance shall be made with
respect to any Improved Property after the Acquisition Date therefor, and no
Advance shall be made with respect to any Uncompleted Property after the earlier
of (x) the Completion Date for such Property and (y) the Outside Completion Date
for such Property and (ii) the Agent Certificate Holder shall not be obligated

Improvements Costs plus Land Acquisition Cost and (z) 105% of the Fair Market
Sales Value of such Property as set forth in the As-Completed Appraisal thereof
delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b) hereof. Nothing set forth in this Section
or this Agreement shall compel Lessee to pay for any cost overrun for an
Uncompleted Property.

         Section 3.2. Certificate Holders' Commitments. Subject to the
conditions and terms hereof, each of the Certificate Holders shall make
available to the Agent Certificate Holder at the request of the Construction
Agent from time to time during the Commitment Period on any Funding Date or on
the Acquisition Date, as appropriate, an amount (relative to such Certificate
Holder, a "Certificate Holder Amount") in immediately available funds equal to
such Certificate Holder's Commitment Percentage of the amount of the Advance
being funded on such Funding Date or Acquisition Date. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, no Certificate Holder shall be obligated to make available any

Holder Amount, the outstanding aggregate amount of the Certificate Holder Amount
of such Certificate Holder would exceed such Certificate Holder's Commitment.

         Section 3.3. Lenders' Commitments. Subject to the conditions and terms
hereof, each of the Lenders shall make Loans to the Agent Certificate Holder at

proposed Loan, the outstanding aggregate amount of such Lender's Loans would
exceed such Lender's Commitment.

         Section 3.4. Procedures for Advances. (a) With respect to each Advance,
the Construction Agent (or in the case of Improved Properties, the Lessee) shall

foregoing, the Construction Agent shall also specify: (i) the Property to be
acquired or leased, (ii) the seller or ground lessor of the Property and the

                                       -6-
<PAGE>


Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts made with respect to each Advance shall be
Base Rate Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts, and the duration of the initial
Interest Period with respect to such Advance shall begin on the proposed
Acquisition Date or Funding Date and end on the next succeeding Scheduled
Payment Date (the "Initial Interest Period"). Subject to timely delivery of a
Funding Request and the other terms and conditions of the Operative Documents,
each Participant shall make its Commitment Percentage of the requested Advance
available to the Agent Certificate Holder by 1:00 p.m., (Chicago time), on the
requested Acquisition Date or Funding Date. The Agent Certificate Holder and the
Administrative Agent shall calculate the amounts of the Certificate Holder
Amounts and the Loans required to fund the requested Advance. No more than one
(1) Funding Request shall be made during any calendar month.


         (b) Except as the Participants may otherwise agree in writing, Advances
shall be made solely to provide the Lessee (with respect to Improved Properties)
and Construction Agent (with respect to Uncompleted Properties) with funds with
which to pay any Land Acquisition Costs or to pay or reimburse itself for
Property Improvement Costs or Transaction Expenses, as the case may be.

     Section 3.5.  Interest Rate;  Yield Rate. Each Loan and Certificate  Holder
Amount shall accrue  interest or Yield,  as the case may be, by reference to the
Base Rate or the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate in accordance with Section 3.6.

     Section 3.6. Interest Period Selection/Continuation/Conversion Elections.
(a) By delivering an Interest Period Selection/Continuation/Conversion Notice to
the Agent Certificate Holder and Administrative Agent with respect to
Certificate Holder Amounts and Loans, respectively, the Lessee may from time to
time during the Lease Term irrevocably select, on not less than three (3) nor
more than five (5) Business Days' notice, that all or any portion of the
outstanding Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts be, in the case of Base Rate
Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts, converted into Eurodollar Loans/Certificate
Holder Amounts or, in the case of Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts,
converted into Base Rate Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts or continued as
Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts and, with respect to Eurodollar
Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts, select the duration for the next succeeding
Interest Period; provided, however, that (a) in the absence of a delivery of an
Interest Period Selection/Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to any
Eurodollar Loan/Certificate Holder Amount at least three (3) Business Days
before the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto,
the Lessee shall be deemed to have selected that such Eurodollar
Loan/Certificate Holder Amount be continued as a Eurodollar Loan/Certificate
Holder Amount on such last day with an Interest Period of one (1) month, (b)
each such conversion or continuation shall be pro rated among the applicable
outstanding Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts of all Participants, (c) no
portion of any Loan or Certificate Holder Amount may be continued as, or
converted into, a Eurodollar Loan/Certificate Holder Amount when any Lease
Default or Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (d) the
outstanding Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts may not be apportioned into
more than six (6) separate Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts pursuant to this
Section 3.6 at any one time and each such Eurodollar Loan/Certificateholder
Amount shall be in a minimum amount of $500,000, and (e) during the Construction
Period, Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts will be limited to one (1)
month Interest Periods.


                                       -7-
<PAGE>

         (b) The Lessee, with respect to any Loans and Certificate Holder
Amounts outstanding during the Interim Lease Term, shall be deemed to have (i)
converted Base Rate Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts into Eurodollar
Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts at the end of the Initial Interest Period, (ii)
as of each Scheduled Payment Date (other than the Interim Termination Date),
continued all outstanding Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts as
Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts and (iii) as of each Scheduled
Payment Date (other than the Interim Termination Date) selected an Interest
Period ending on the earlier of the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date and
the Interim Termination Date.

Each Interest Period Selection/Continuation/Conversion Notice so delivered or
deemed delivered by the Lessee shall be deemed an effective election by the
Certificate Holders of the method for computing interest on the Loans under the
Loan Agreement.

      Section 3.7. Voluntary Commitment Terminations. The Lessee shall have
the right at any time and from time to time upon not less than five (5) Business
Days prior notice to the Agent Certificate Holder and the Administrative Agent
(which shall promptly notify the Lenders) to terminate the Commitments in whole
or in part (but if in part then in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or such lesser
amount as will terminate the Commitments in full) pro rata in proportion among
the Lenders and the Certificate Holders. No termination of the Commitments
hereunder may be reinstated.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                              YIELD; INTEREST; FEES

         Section 4.1. Yield. (a) The amount of the Certificate Holder Amounts
outstanding from time to time shall accrue yield ("Yield") at the Yield Rate,
calculated using the actual number of days elapsed and, when the Yield Rate is
based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, a 360-day year basis and, if calculated
at the Base Rate, a 360-day year basis if the Base Rate is calculated at the
Federal Funds Rate, and a 365-, or, if applicable, 366-, day year basis if the
Base Rate is calculated at the Prime Rate. If all or any portion of the
Certificate Holder Amounts, any Yield payable thereon or any other amount
payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at stated maturity,
acceleration thereof or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a
rate per annum which is equal to the Overdue Rate. Upon the occurrence, and
during the continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the principal of and, to the
extent permitted by law, interest on (or Yield on) the Certificate Holder
Amounts and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Operative
Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the Overdue Rate. The
Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
12:00 (noon), Chicago time, two (2) Business Days before the effectiveness of
each Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, cause to be determined such Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate, the resulting Yield and Basic Rent, and notify the Lessee, each
Certificate Holder and Lender thereof.

         (b) The Administrative Agent shall distribute, in accordance with
Article VII, the Certificate Holder Basic Rent and all other amounts due with
respect to the Certificate Holder Amounts paid to the Administrative Agent by
the Lessee under the Lease from time to time.


                                       -8-
<PAGE>

         (c) During the Interim Lease Term for any Property, Yield on
outstanding Certificate Holder Amounts made with respect to such Property shall
be paid from Advances by the Certificate Holders deemed to have been requested
by the Lessee pursuant to Section 3.4 on each Scheduled Payment Date, and the
Property Improvement Costs shall be increased on the date of each such Advance
by an amount equal to such Advance; provided that if a Completion Certificate is
delivered less than three (3) Business Days prior to a Scheduled Payment Date,
solely for purposes of this clause (c) such Completion Certificate shall not be
effective until the day after such Scheduled Payment Date.

         (d) During the Basic Lease Term for any Property, Yield on outstanding
Certificate Holder Amounts made with respect to such Property shall be due and
payable in cash on each Scheduled Payment Date during such Basic Lease Term and
not funded pursuant to deemed Advances as referred to in clause (c) above.

         (e) If not repaid sooner, the outstanding aggregate Certificate Holder
Amounts shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date, subject to the provisions
of Article XX of the Master Lease.

     Section  4.2.  Interest  on Loans.  (a) Each  Loan  shall  accrue  interest
computed and payable in accordance  with the terms of the Loan  Agreement.  Each
Loan shall become due and payable at the dates and times provided under the Loan
Agreement.

         (b) The Administrative Agent shall distribute, in accordance with
Article VII, the Lender Basic Rent and all other amounts due with respect to the
Loans paid to the Administrative Agent by the Lessee under the Lease from time

         Section 4.3.    Prepayments.

         (a) Voluntary Prepayments. The Lessee shall have the right, at any time
(subject to subsection (d) below), to prepay an amount equal to the aggregate
outstanding Property Balance with respect to each Property in whole, but not in
part, pursuant to, and subject to, the exercise of the purchase option permitted
under the Lease, without premium or penalty.

         (b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) If at any time the sum of the aggregate
amount of outstanding Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts shall exceed the
Aggregate Commitment Amount, the Lessee shall immediately make payment on the
Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts in an amount sufficient to eliminate such
excess; provided that the Lessee shall not be required to make such payments (y)
with respect to Uncompleted Properties during the Interim Lease Term and (z) if
such excess is attributable to a default by a Lender, Certificate Holder or
Lessor Trust under the Loan Agreement or this Participation Agreement and, with
respect to Lessor Trust, not attributable to a Lease Event of Default. Payments
required to be made hereunder shall be applied to Base Rate Loans/Certificate
Holder Amounts and then to Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts in direct
order of their Interest Period maturities.

        (ii) All amounts payable by the Lessee pursuant to Article XIV, XV, XVI,
XVIII or XX of the Master Lease shall be applied to the Loans and the
Certificate Holder Amounts in the manner set forth in Article VII hereof.

     (e) Nonrevolving Credit. Any amounts prepaid in accordance herewith may not

     (b)  Administrative   Agent's  Fees.  The  Lessee  agrees  to  pay  to  the
Administrative  Agent for its own  account  the  Administrative  Agent's  fee in
accordance with the Fee Letter.

     (c) Commitment  Fee. The Lessee agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent
for the  account of each  Participant,  for the period  (including  any  portion
thereof when its Commitment is suspended by reason of the Lessee's  inability to
satisfy any condition of Article VI)  commencing on the  Documentation  Date and
continuing through the Interim Termination Date, a commitment fee (collectively,
the "Commitment Fees") with respect to each such Lender and Certificate  Holder,
calculated at a rate of 1/4 of 1% on such Participant's Commitment Percentage of
the average daily Available Commitments.

     The  Commitment  Fees  shall be  payable  by the  Lessee in arrears on each
Quarterly  Payment  Date,  commencing  with the  first  such day  following  the
Documentation  Date,  and on the  last  day of  Interim  Termination  Date.  The
Commitment  Fees shall be  computed  on the basis of the  actual  number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring during the period
for which such Commitment Fees are payable over a year of 360 days.

     (d) Owner Trustee's Fees. The Lessee agrees to pay to the Owner Trustee the
fees set forth in the letter from Owner Trustee to Lessee dated July 14, 2000.

         Section 4.5. Place and Manner of Payments. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments by the Lessee hereunder, under the
Master Lease or under any other Operative Document shall be made to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds, without offset,
deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any kind, to the Account in Chicago,
Illinois not later than 12:00 p.m. (Noon) (Chicago time) on the date when due.
Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day. The Lessee shall, at the time it makes any payment
under any Operative Document, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans and
Certificate Holder Amounts, fees or other amounts payable by the Lessee
hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails
so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms
hereof, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders
and the Certificate Holders in such manner as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by Lessee subject to
the terms of Section 4.6). The Administrative Agent will distribute such

                                      -10-

<PAGE>


payments to such Lenders and Certificate Holders in accordance with Article VII,
if any such payment is received prior to 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on a Business
Day in like funds as received prior to such time, and otherwise the
Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to such Lenders and
Certificate Holders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment
hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the
due date thereof shall be extended to the next Business Day (subject to accrual
of interest and fees for the period of such extension), except that in the case
of Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts, if the extension would cause the
payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall
instead be made on the next preceding Business Day.

         Section 4.6. Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise
provided herein, each Advance, each payment or repayment of principal on any
outstanding Loan or Certificate Holder Amount and each payment of interest or
Yield shall be allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders and Certificate
Holders, as the case may be, in accordance with the respective applicable
Commitments (or, if the Commitments of such Lenders or Certificate Holders have
expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts
of their outstanding Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts, as the case may be).

         Section 4.7. Sharing of Payments. The Participants agree among
themselves that, in the event that any Participant shall obtain payment in
respect of any Loan or Certificate Holder Amount or any other obligation owing
to such Participant under the Operative Documents through the exercise of a
right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim
under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or
interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Participant under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Participation Agreement, such Participant shall
promptly purchase from the other Participants a participation in such Loans or
Certificate Holder Amounts and other obligations in such amounts, and make such
other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all
Participants share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable
shares as provided for in this Participation Agreement. The Participants further
agree among themselves that if payment to a Participant obtained by such
Participant through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien,
counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be
restored, each Participant which shall have shared the benefit of such payment
shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of
that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with
respect thereto) to each Participant whose payment shall have been rescinded or
otherwise restored. The Lessee agrees that any Participant so purchasing such a
participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights
of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Participant were a holder of such Loan or
Certificate Holder Amount or other obligation in the amount of such
participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any
Participant, the Agent Certificate Holder or the Administrative Agent shall fail
to remit to the Administrative Agent, the Agent Certificate Holder or any other
Participant an amount payable by such party to the Administrative Agent, the

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

Agent Certificate Holder or such other Participant pursuant to the Operative
Documents on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made
together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due
until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, the Agent
Certificate Holder or such other Participant at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law, any Participant receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to
which this Section 4.7 applies, such Participant shall, to the extent
practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
consistent with the rights of the Participants under this Section 4.7 to share
in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         Section 4.9. Certain Rights of Lenders. The Required Participants shall
have the right, upon the occurrence of any Construction Agency Agreement Event
of Default with respect to which recourse to the Lessee and Construction Agent
is limited as set forth in Section 5.4 of the Construction Agency Agreement, to
direct the Administrative Agent and Agent Certificate Holder to, and upon
receipt of any such directions such Agents shall, (a) use reasonable commercial
efforts to sell the applicable Uncompleted Property or Uncompleted Properties to
a third-party purchaser and/or (b) engage an Appraiser to appraise the Appraised
Value of such Property, in each case as directed by the Required Participants in
their sole discretion.


                                    ARTICLE V

                        CERTAIN INTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES

         Section 5.1. Nature of Transaction. (a) The parties hereto intend that
(i) for financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, the Lessor
Trust will be treated as the owner and the lessor of the Property and the Lessee
will be treated as the lessee of the Property and (ii) for federal and all state
and local income tax purposes, state real estate and commercial law and
bankruptcy purposes,

                   (A)     the Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement,

                   (B) the Certificate Holders and the Lenders will be deemed
         lenders making loans to the Lessees in an amount equal to the sum of
         the Certificate Holder Amounts and the outstanding principal amount of
         the Loans, which amounts are secured by the Properties, and

                   (C) the Lessee will be treated as the owner of the Property
         described in the Lease Supplement and will be entitled to all tax
         benefits ordinarily available to an owner of properties like the
         Property for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the Lessee acknowledges
         and agrees that neither the Agent Certificate Holder, the
         Administrative Agent nor any of the Certificate Holders or Lenders has
         made any representations or warranties to the Lessee concerning the
         tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents and
         that the Lessee has obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting and
         legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it deems
         appropriate.

         (b) Specifically, without limiting the generality of clause (a) of this
Section 5.1, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the event of any
insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the Lessee, the
Guarantor, the Lessor Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Holders, or the
Lenders or any collection actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative
Documents shall be regarded as loans made by the Certificate Holders and the
Lenders as unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee.

                                      -12-
<PAGE>



         Section 5.2. Amounts Due Under the Lease. Anything herein or elsewhere

<PAGE>

         constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Lessee or the
         Guarantor enforceable against such in accordance with its terms, except
         as such enforceability may be limited by (A) applicable bankruptcy,
         insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
         the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (B) general
         principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                           (ii) If the transactions are treated as creating a
                  secured loan to Lessee, as is the intent of the parties
                  hereto, each of the Lessor Financing Statements, the Lessor
                  Mortgage and the Lease Supplements, if any, creates, or upon
                  their execution, recordation and filing will create valid
                  security interests in and mortgage liens on the Property
                  purported to be covered thereby, which security interests and
                  mortgage liens are, and will remain to the extent appropriate
                  UCC continuation filings are made, perfected security
                  interests and mortgage liens, prior to all Liens other than
                  Permitted Property Liens.


                  (d) Governmental and Other Approvals. No action, consent or
         approval of, registration or filing with or any other action by any
         Governmental Authority or any third party is or will be required in
         connection with the activities of Lessee and the Guarantor pursuant to
         the Transactions or the enforceability of any Operative Document
         against either Lessee or the Guarantor to which Lessee or the Guarantor
         is a party, except such as have been made or obtained and are in full
         force and effect.

                  (e) Financial Statements. RMC has heretofore furnished to the
         Administrative Agent, the Agent Certificate Holder and each Participant
         with the following financial statements, identified by a principal
         financial officer of RMC: (i) a consolidated balance sheet of RMC and
         its Subsidiaries as at fiscal year end in each of the three fiscal
         years of RMC most recently completed prior to the date as of which this
         representation is made or repeated to such Participant (other than
         fiscal years completed within ninety (90) days prior to such date for
         which audited financial statements have not been released) and
         consolidated statements of operations and cash flows and a consolidated
         statement of capital stock and retained earnings of RMC and its
         Subsidiaries for each such year, all reported on by
         PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or any other independent public accounting
         firm of recognized national standing) and (ii) a consolidated balance
         sheet of RMC and its Subsidiaries as at the end of the quarterly period
         (if any) most recently completed prior to such date and after the end
         of such fiscal year (other than quarterly periods completed within 60
         days prior to such date for which financial statements have not been
         released) and the comparable quarterly period in the preceding fiscal
         year and consolidated statements of operations and cash flows and a
         consolidated statement of capital stock and retained earnings for the
         period from the beginning of the fiscal years in which such quarterly
         periods are included to the end of such quarterly period, prepared by
         RMC. Such financial statements (including any related schedules and/or
         notes) are true and correct in all material respects (subject, as to
         interim statements, to changes resulting from audits and year-end
         adjustments), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
         followed throughout the periods involved and show all liabilities,


                                      -29-
<PAGE>

         direct and contingent, of RMC and its Subsidiaries required to be shown
         in accordance with such principles. The balance sheets fairly present
         the condition of RMC and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof, and
         the statements of operations, capital stock and retained earnings and
         cash flows fairly present the results of the operations of RMC and its
         Subsidiaries and their cash flows for the periods indicated.

                  (f) Intentionally Omitted

                  (g) Title to Properties. RMC and each of its Subsidiaries,
         including Lessee, has good and indefeasible title to its respective
         real properties (other than properties which it leases) and good title
         to all of its other respective properties and assets, including the
         properties and assets reflected in the most recent audited balance
         sheet referred to in Section 8.2(e) (other than properties and assets
         disposed of in the ordinary course of business), subject to no Lien of
         any kind except Liens permitted by Section 10.2(a).

                  (h) Intentionally Omitted

                  (i) Litigation; Compliance with Laws. There is no action,
         suit, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
         Lessee or the Guarantor, threatened against the Lessee or the Guarantor
         or any of the Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of the Lessee
         or the Guarantor or any of the Subsidiaries, by or before any court,
         arbitrator or administrative or governmental body that could be
         reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (j) Federal Reserve Regulations. (i) neither Lessee nor the
         Guarantor is engaged in the business of extending credit for the
         purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

                           (ii) No part of the proceeds of any Advance will be
                  used by the Lessee, whether directly or indirectly, and
                  whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, (A) to the
                  purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to others
                  for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock or to
                  refund indebtedness originally incurred for such purpose, or
                  (B) for any purpose which entails a violation of, or which is
                  inconsistent with the provisions of the Regulations of the
                  F.R.S. Board, including Regulation U or X.

                  (k) Governmental Regulation. Neither Lessee nor the Guarantor
         is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment
         company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment
         Company Act of 1940 or subject to regulation under the Public Utility
         Holding Company Act of 1935.

                  (l) Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of each Advance will be used
         only for the purpose of financing the acquisition of Land or leasehold
         interests therein (and Improvements existing thereon, if any) and, the
         payment of Property Improvement Costs incurred in connection therewith.

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

                  (m) Tax Returns. The Lessee, RMC and each of the Subsidiaries
         has filed all federal, state and other income tax returns which, to the
         actual knowledge of the officers of the Lessee, RMC and the
         Subsidiaries, are required to be filed, and each has paid all taxes as
         shown on such returns and on all assessments received by it to the
         extent that such taxes have become due, except such taxes (i) as are
         being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for which
         adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP or (ii)
         the non-payment of which (a) could not be reasonably expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect, and (b) does not result in the creation of any
         Lien other than Liens permitted by Section 10.2(b) hereof.

                  (n) No Misstatements. Neither the Operative Documents nor any
         other document, certificate or statement furnished to the Participant
         by or on behalf of the Lessee or the Guarantor in connection herewith
         contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
         material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
         herein and therein not Materially misleading.

                  (o) ERISA. No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in
         section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not
         waived, exists with respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer
         Plan). No liability to the PBGC has been or is expected by RMC or any
         ERISA Affiliate to be incurred with respect to any Plan (other than a
         Multiemployer Plan) by RMC, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate which
         would have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither RMC, any Subsidiary nor
         any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or presently expects to incur any
         withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any
         Multiemployer Plan which is or would be materially adverse to the
         business, property or assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or
         operations of RMC and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The execution
         and delivery of the Operative Documents and the consummation of the
         Transactions will be exempt from or will not involve any transaction
         which is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA and will
         not involve any transaction in connection with which a penalty could be
         imposed under Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax could be imposed
         pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.

                  (p) Environmental Compliance. The Lessee, RMC and the
         Subsidiaries and all of their respective properties and facilities have
         complied (or upon knowledge of a violation, have taken such steps as
         are necessary to comply) at all times and in all respects with all
         applicable foreign, federal, state, local and regional statutes, laws,
         ordinances and judicial or administrative orders, judgments, rulings
         and regulations relating to protection of the environment except, in
         any such case, where failure to so comply could not reasonably be
         expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (q) Offer of Securities, etc. Neither Lessee, RMC nor any
         Person authorized to act on their behalf has, directly or indirectly,
         offered any interest in the Property or any other interest similar
         thereto (the sale or offer of which would be integrated with the sale
         or offer of such interest in the Property), for sale to, or solicited
         any offer to acquire any of the same from, any Person other than each
         initial Participant and the Administrative Agent, the Agent Certificate
         Holder and other "accredited investors" (as defined in Regulation D of

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

         the Securities and Exchange Commission); provided that the sale and the
         offer of sale of interests in RMC shall not be deemed a direct or
         indirect offer of any interest in the Property for the purposes of this
         subsection.

                  (r) Property. The Property as improved in accordance with the
         Plans and Specifications and the contemplated use thereof by the Lessee
         and its agents, assignees, employees, lessees, sublessees, licensees,
         tenants and subtenants shall be in material compliance with all
         Requirements of Law (including, without limitation, all zoning and land
         use laws and Environmental Laws) and Insurance Requirements, except for
         such Requirements of Law as it shall be contesting in good faith by
         appropriate proceedings. There is no action, suit or proceeding
         (including any proceeding in condemnation or eminent domain or under
         any Environmental Law) pending or, to Lessee's actual knowledge,
         threatened with respect to it, or the Property which materially
         adversely affects the title to, or the use, operation or value of, the
         Property except as has been previously disclosed to the Agent
         Certificate Holder and Administrative Agent in writing.

                  (s) Plans and Specifications. Upon completion of construction
         for each Property, all utilities required to adequately service the
         applicable Improvements for the Property's intended use as a wine
         production, distribution or storage facility will be available pursuant
         to adequate permits (including any that may be required under
         applicable Environmental Laws). No undisclosed casualty has had a
         Material Adverse Effect on any Property. Upon completion of
         construction for each Property, the Property will have available all
         Material services of public facilities and other utilities necessary
         for use and operation of the Property for its intended purpose as a
         wine production, distribution or storage facility including, without
         limitation, adequate water and electricity. All utilities serving the
         Property or proposed to serve the Property in accordance with the Plans
         and Specifications are located in, and access to the Property is
         provided by, either public rights-of-way abutting the Property or
         Appurtenant Rights. All Material licenses, approvals, authorizations,
         consents, permits (including, without limitation, building, demolition
         and environmental permits, licenses, approvals, authorizations and
         consents), easements and rights-of-way, including proof and dedication,
         required for (x) the use, treatment, storage, transport, disposal or
         disposition of any Hazardous Material on, at, under or from the
         Property during the construction of the Improvements thereon, and (y)
         construction of the Improvements on the Property in accordance with the
         Plans and Specifications and the Construction Agency Agreement have
         either been irrevocably obtained from the appropriate Governmental
         Authorities having jurisdiction or from private parties, as the case
         may be, or will be irrevocably obtained from the appropriate
         Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction or from private parties,
         as the case may be, prior to commencing any such construction or use
         and operation, as applicable. Prior to any Advance with respect of the
         Land or Improvements, the Lessee has obtained (or will obtain prior to
         the Completion Date) all appropriate Governmental Action, and has and
         will keep in full force and effect, all material operating permits
         necessary to allow for the Property to be operated in accordance with
         its intended use.

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

                  (t) Deed. With respect to the acquisition by purchase of the
         Property on the Acquisition Date, the Deed will be sufficient to convey
         good and marketable title to the Property (subject to the Permitted
         Property Liens) to the Lessor Trust. With respect to the acquisition by
         ground lease of the Property on the Acquisition Date, the ground lease
         will be sufficient to convey good and marketable leasehold title to the
         Property (subject to Permitted Property Liens) to the Lessor Trust.

                  (u) Insurance. Lessee will, on or before the Acquisition Date,
         have obtained insurance coverage covering the Property which meets the
         requirements of the Master Lease, and such coverage is in full force
         and effect.

                  (v) Flood Hazard Areas. Except as otherwise identified on the
         applicable survey, plat or map delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(p), no
         portion of the Property will be located within an area identified as a
         special flood hazardous area by the Federal Emergency Management
         Agency.

                  (w) Solvency. The Guarantor and the Lessee are Solvent.

                  (x) Intentionally Omitted.


                  (y) Conflicting Agreements and Other Matters. Neither the
         Lessee, RMC nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or
         agreement or subject to any charter or other corporate restriction
         which has a Material Adverse Effect. None of the execution and delivery
         of this Participation Agreement or any other Operative Document, the
         making of the Loans or the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms
         and provisions hereof and of the other Operative Documents will
         conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or
         provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in any
         violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
         properties or assets of the Lessee, RMC or any of the Subsidiaries
         pursuant to, the charter or by-laws of the Lessee, RMC or any of the
         Subsidiaries, any award of any arbitrator or any agreement (including
         any agreement with stockholders), instrument, order, judgment, decree,
         statute, law, rule or regulation to which the Lessee, RMC or any of the
         Subsidiaries is subject.

         Section 8.3. Representations with Respect to each Funding Date and the
Acquisition Date. The Lessee and the Guarantor each represents and warrants to
the Administrative Agent, the Lessor Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Agent
Certificate Holder and each Participant as of each Funding Date and the
Acquisition Date, as to itself, as follows:

                  (a) Representations and Warranties. Its representations and
         warranties set forth in Section 8.2 are true and correct in all
         material respects on and as of such Funding Date and the Acquisition
         Date, as the case may be, except to the extent such representations or
         warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such
         representations and warranties shall have been true and correct on and
         as of such earlier date. It is in compliance with its obligations under
         the Operative Documents and there exists no Lease Default or Lease
         Event of Default. No Lease Default or Lease Event of Default will occur
         as a result of, or after giving effect to, the Advance requested by the
         Funding Request on such date.

                  (b) Improvements. The Construction of the Improvements, to the
         best knowledge of the Construction Agent and Lessee, has been performed
         in a good and workmanlike manner, substantially in accordance with the
         Plans and Specifications therefor in all material respects and in
         compliance with all Insurance Requirements and Requirements of Law.

                  (c) Liens. Lessee has not permitted any Liens to be placed
         against the Property other than Permitted Property Liens.

                  (d) Advance. The amount of the Advance requested represents
         amounts advanced or to be advanced by the Construction Agent to third
         parties in connection with Land Acquisition Costs or Property
         Improvement Costs. With respect to each Advance, the conditions
         precedent to such Advance and the related Certificate Holder Amounts
         and Loans set forth in Article VI have been satisfied.

     Section 8.4.  Warranties and  Representations  of the Owner Trustee.  First
Security Bank,  National  Association  warrants and represents in its individual
capacity  notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 15.19 hereof or any similar
provision of any other Operative Document, that:

                           (vii) Liens securing Indebtedness of a Subsidiary
                  owing to RMC;

                           (viii) notwithstanding the restrictions provided
                  herein, RMC or any of its Subsidiaries may create, issue,
                  incur or assume Liens and secured Indebtedness not otherwise
                  permitted by (i) through (vii) above provided that the sum of:
                  (a) such Liens or secured Indebtedness incurred solely under
                  this clause (viii); and (b) the amount of Indebtedness
                  incurred solely under (v) of the provision on Subsidiary

                  equal to 10% of Consolidated Total Assets;

                           (ix) the extension, renewal or replacement of any
                  Lien permitted by the foregoing in respect of the same
                  property subject to such Lien (without increase of principal
                  amount of the Indebtedness secured thereby); and

                           (x) Liens securing any Indebtedness of Lessee or
                  Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries to secure the
                  Obligations.

                  (b) RMC's Subsidiaries (except RME) may not issue, incur or
         assume any Indebtedness, except Indebtedness which is:

                           (i) owed to RMC or another Subsidiary;

                           (ii) existing Indebtedness of a Subsidiary
                  outstanding at the time of the issuance of the Loans and
                  Certificate Holder Amounts;

                           (iii) any Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted to
                  be incurred under clause (v) of section 10.02(a);

                           (iv) any Indebtedness outstanding when such entity
                  becomes a Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated with another
                  Subsidiary;

                           (v) notwithstanding the restrictions provided herein,
                  Subsidiaries may issue, incur or assume additional
                  Indebtedness not otherwise permitted by (i) through (iv) above
                  provided that the sum of such Indebtedness incurred solely
                  under this clause (v) and Indebtedness incurred solely under
                  clause (viii) of section 10.02(a) does not exceed an amount
                  equal to 10% of Consolidated Total Assets; and

                           (vi) renewals, extensions and refundings of
                  Indebtedness permitted by the foregoing provided that the
                  outstanding amount of Indebtedness is not increased.

                  Notwithstanding Section 10.02(a) and (b), RMC shall not create
         or suffer to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to create or
         suffer to exist, any Lien upon or with respect to any of their
         inventory, accounts receivable or general intangibles as defined by
         Division 9 of the California Commercial Code, except the Liens set
         forth in subsections 10.02(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi). In the event
         that any property, asset or income or profits therefrom is subject to a
         Lien not expressly enumerated in Section 10.02(a), RMC will make or
         cause to be made provision whereby the Loans, Certificate Holders
         Amounts and this Participation Agreement will be secured equally and
         ratably with all other Debt secured thereby and property subject to
         such Lien.

                  (c) Mergers, Consolidations and Sales of Assets. RMC will not,
         and will not permit any of its Material Subsidiaries to (i) consolidate
         with or be a party to a merger with any other corporation except in the
         case of a merger or consolidation where RMC or the Material Subsidiary
         is the surviving corporation, or (ii) sell, lease or otherwise dispose

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

         of all or substantially all of the assets of RMC and its Material
         Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any other Person.

                  (d) Change in Ownership of RME and Lessee. RMC will at all
         times own, directly or indirectly, not less than 100% of all of the
         issued and outstanding stock (and any securities convertible at any
         time and from time to time into capital stock) of Lessee free and clear
         of all Liens, it being understood that this Section shall not be
         construed to prevent a merger of Lessee into RMC as otherwise permitted
         by this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                      RENEWALS; REPLACEMENT OF PARTICIPANTS

        Section 11.1. Extensions of Maturity Date and Expiration Date;
Replacement of Participants. (a) So long as the Lessee has not elected the
Remarketing Option on behalf of the Lessee, the Lessee may, not earlier than one
(1) year after the Completion Date and not later than one (1) year prior to the
Maturity Date, direct a written request to the Owner Trustee, the Agent
Certificate Holder and the Administrative Agent that the Expiration Date then in
effect under the Master Lease be extended to the date occurring one (1) year
after such Expiration Date and concurrently therewith request that the
Administrative Agent and the Agent Certificate Holder direct a written request
to the Certificate Holders and the Lenders that the applicable Maturity Date be
extended to the same date (each such additional year, a "Renewal Term"). In no
event may the Expiration Date or the Maturity Date be extended more than once
pursuant to this Section 11.1(a). Each Participant may grant or deny its consent
to a Renewal Term in its sole discretion by notifying the Administrative Agent
and the Agent Certificate Holder in writing (with a copy to the Lessee);
provided, however, that any Participant that fails to respond to such request
for a Renewal Term within sixty (60) days after its receipt thereof shall be
deemed to have denied such request for a Renewal Term. Nothing contained in this
Section 11.1 shall impair any extension of the Expiration Date to any Extended
Expiration Date pursuant to Section 20.3 of the Lease.

         (b) In connection with a written request of the Lessee for a Renewal
Term, upon the request of the Lessee, the Administrative Agent and the Agent
Certificate Holder shall be permitted to replace any non-consenting Participant
and any Participant that fails to respond to the Administrative Agent's and the
Agent Certificate Holder's written request for a Renewal Term within the time
period specified in clause (a) above (each, a "Non-Consenting Participant") with
a replacement bank or other financial institution (a "Replacement Participant")
satisfactory to the Lessee, the Certificate Holders and the Lenders, with such
replacement to be effective as of the Expiration Date and Maturity Date in
effect prior to the requested Renewal Term; provided, however, that (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) the Replacement
Participant shall purchase from the Non-Consenting Participant (A) at par, all
Loans, in the case of a Lender, and all Certificate Holder Amounts, in the case
of a Certificate Holder, (B) all accrued interest, in the case of a Lender, and
all accrued Yield, in the case of a Certificate Holder, and (C) all other
amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Participant on or prior to the date of
replacement, in each case, (iii) the Lessee shall be liable to such
Non-Consenting Participant under Section 13.10 if any Loan or Certificate Holder

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

Amount, as the case may be, owing to such Non-Consenting Participant shall be
prepaid (or purchased) at the request of the Lessee other than on the last day
of the Interest Period or Interest Periods relating thereto, (iv) such
replacement shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Article XII
(provided that the Lessee or the relevant Replacement Participant shall be
obligated to pay the Transaction Expenses arising in connection therewith), and
(v) the Replacement Participant shall have agreed to be subject to all of the
terms and conditions of the applicable Operative Documents (including the
extension of the Maturity Date contemplated by the relevant request for a
Renewal Term and the related extension). The Administrative Agent and the Agent
Certificate Holder hereby agree to cooperate with the Lessee in its efforts to
arrange one or more Replacement Participants as contemplated by this Section
11.1(b).

         (c) Any Renewal Term and extension of the Maturity Date and the
Expiration Date as contemplated by Section 11.1(a) shall be effective only upon
the consent of all Participants after giving effect to the provisions of Section
11.1(b). Except as otherwise provided in this Article XI, all other terms of the
Operative Documents shall remain unchanged and with the same force and effect
(including the Certificate Holder Margin and Loan Margin), and there shall not
be any additional structuring or underwriting fee in connection with such
Renewal Term.

        Section 11.2. Replacement of Defaulting Participant. The Lessee shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to require any Defaulting Participant to
assign and delegate in accordance with Section 12.1 all of such Lender's or
Certificate Holder's total Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts, as the case may
be, and Commitment, if any, to any other financial institution selected by the
Lessee that, in each case, is willing to accept such assignment and delegation
and shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Agent Certificate
Holder.


                                   ARTICLE XII

                      TRANSFERS OF PARTICIPANTS' INTERESTS

        Section 12.1. Assignments. Each Participant may, with the prior written
consent of the Lessee, the Administrative Agent and the Agent Certificate Holder
(which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that Lessee consent
shall not be required after and during the continuance of a Lease Event of
Default) assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder
pursuant to an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F to
one or more Eligible Lender Assignees, with respect to Lender Commitments and
Loans, and/or Eligible Certificate Holder Assignees with respect to Certificate
Holder Commitments and Certificate Holder Amounts, each such assignment shall be
of a constant, not varying, percentage of all of the assigning Participant's
rights and obligations under the Operative Documents. In the case of assignments
made by a Lender, any such assignment shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 of its Loan Commitment (or the balance of such Loan Commitment, if
less). In the case of assignments made by a Certificate Holder, any such
assignment shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 of its Certificate
Holder Commitment (or the balance of such Certificate Holder Commitment, if
less). Any assignment hereunder shall be effective upon delivery to the
Administrative Agent and the Agent Certificate Holder of written notice of the
assignment together with a transfer fee of $3,500 payable by the assignor
Participant or the assignee Participant to the Administrative Agent for its own
account. The assigning Participant will give prompt notice to the Administrative

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

Agent of any such assignment. Upon the effectiveness of any such assignment (and
after notice to and consent of the Lessee, the Administrative Agent and the
Agent Certificate Holder, as provided herein), the assignee shall become a
"Lender" or "Certificate Holder," as the case may be, for all purposes of the
Operative Documents (including all representations, warranties and covenants
which will all be deemed made and agreed to by such assignee) and, to the extent
of such assignment, the assigning Participant shall be relieved of its
obligations hereunder to the extent of the Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts,
as the case may be, and Commitment components being assigned. The Administrative
Agent agrees that upon notice of any such assignment and surrender of the
appropriate Note or Notes, it will promptly provide to the assigning Lender and
to the assignee separate promissory notes in the amount of their respective
interests substantially in the form of the original Note (but with notation
thereon that it is given in substitution for and replacement of the original
Note or any replacement notes thereof). The Lessee shall not be responsible for
any costs or expenses incurred by any Participant in connection with an
assignment of all or any of its rights and obligations in connection with an
assignment pursuant to this Section 12.1.

        Section 12.2. Participations. Each Participant may sell, transfer, grant
or assign participations in all or any part of such Participant's interests and
obligations hereunder; provided that (i) such selling Participant shall remain a
"Lender" or "Certificate Holder", as the case may be, for all purposes under the
Operative Documents (such selling Participant's obligations under the Operative
Documents remaining unchanged) and the sub-participant shall not constitute a
Lender or a Certificate Holder, as the case may be, hereunder, (ii) no such
sub-participant shall have, or be granted, rights to approve any amendment or
waiver relating to the Operative Documents except to the extent any such
amendment or waiver would (A) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on or
fees in respect of any Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts in which the
sub-participant is participating, (B) postpone the date fixed for any payment of
principal (including extension of the Expiration Date or the date of any
mandatory prepayment), interest or fees in which the sub-participant is
participating, or (C) release all or substantially all of the collateral or
guarantees (except as expressly provided in the Operative Documents) supporting
any of the Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts or Commitments in which the
sub-participant is participating, (iii) sub-sub-participations by the
sub-participant (except to an Affiliate, parent company or Affiliate of a parent
company of the sub-participant) shall be prohibited and (iv) written notice of
each such participation is given to the Lessee. In the case of any such
participation, the sub-participant shall not have any rights under the Operative
Documents (the sub-participant's rights against the selling Participant in
respect of such participation to be those set forth in the participation
agreement with such Participant creating such participation) and all amounts
payable by the Lessee hereunder shall be determined as if such Participant had
not sold such participation; provided, however, that such sub-participant shall
be entitled to receive additional amounts under Sections 13.5, 13.10 and 13.11
on the same basis as if it were a Participant (but only to the extent that the
Participant would have been entitled to receive such additional amounts with
respect to the interest participated had it not sold such participation). The
Lessee shall not be responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by any
Participant in connection with a sale, transfer, grant or assignment of
participations pursuant to this Section 12.2.

        Section 12.3. Withholding Taxes; Disclosure of Information; Pledge Under
Regulation A. (a) If any Participant (or the assignee of or subparticipant of a
Participant, each a "Transferee") is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, then such
Participant or the Transferee of such Participant, as applicable, shall (as a
condition precedent to acquiring or participating in such Loan or Certificate
Holder Amount and as a continuing obligation to the Certificate Holder and the
Lender) (i) furnish to each of the Administrative Agent, the Agent Certificate
Holder and the Lessee in duplicate, for each taxable year of such Participant or
Transferee during the term of the Lease, a properly completed and executed copy
of either Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or Internal Revenue Service Form
1001 and Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or Internal Revenue Service Form W-9
and any additional form (or such other form) as is necessary to claim complete
exemption from United States withholding taxes (wherein such Transferee claims
entitlement to complete exemption from United States withholding taxes on all
payments hereunder), and (ii) provide to each of the Administrative Agent, the
Agent Certificate Holder and the Lessee a new Internal Revenue Service Form 4224
or Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 and Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and any such additional form (or any successor
form or forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered
form and comparable statements in accordance with applicable United States laws
and regulations and amendments duly executed and completed by such Participant
or Transferee, and to comply from time to time with all applicable United States
laws and regulations with regard to such withholding tax exemption. By its
acceptance of a participation or assignment hereunder, each Transferee shall be
deemed bound by the provisions set forth in this Article XII.

         (b) Any Participant may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Article
XII, disclose to such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to Lessee, the Guarantor or the
Transactions, subject to appropriate confidentiality requirements relating to
such information.

         (c) Anything in this Article XII to the contrary notwithstanding, any
Participant may without the consent of Lessee, the Administrative Agent or the
Agent Certificate Holder, assign and pledge all or any portion of the Notes held
by it to any Federal Reserve Bank, the United States Treasury or to any other
financial institution as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the
F.R.S. Board and any operating circular issued by the Federal Reserve System
and/or the Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise; provided, any payment by Lessee or
the Guarantor for the benefit of the assigning or pledging Participant shall be
deemed to satisfy the Lessee's or the Guarantor's obligations with respect
thereto.


                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

        Section 13.1. General Indemnification. (a) Interim Lease Term. The
Lessee agrees, whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be consummated, to assume liability for, and to indemnify, protect, defend, save
and keep harmless Lessor Trust (which right to indemnity may be assigned by the
Lessor Trust), on an After Tax Basis, from and against, any and all Claims that

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Lessor Trust (whether because
of action or omission by Lessor Trust or otherwise) during the Interim Lease
Term, whether or not Lessor Trust shall also be indemnified as to any such Claim
by any other Person and whether or not such Claim arises or accrues prior to the
Documentation Date or after the Expiration Date, in any way relating to or
arising out of any of the circumstances described in clauses (i) through (vii)
of Section 13.1(b) below, where such Claims relate to the action or omission of
the Lessee or its Affiliates while located on, in possession of, controlling or
acting or failing to act with respect to any Uncompleted Property or arise from
fraud, misapplication of funds, illegal acts or willful misconduct of the Lessee
or its Affiliates. The Lessee acknowledges and agrees for the benefit of the
Participants in this connection that (x) each Property is in its control and
possession during the Interim Lease Term therefor, (y) it is responsible as
Construction Agent for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors and agents
and (z) it has agreed to maintain each Property free from injury or mishap to
third persons; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit or
otherwise affect any rights the Lessee may have against third parties.

         (b) Basic Lease Term. The Lessee agrees to assume liability for, and to
indemnify, protect, defend, save and keep harmless each Indemnitee, on an After
Tax Basis, from and against any and all Claims (but excluding any such Claim
that relates to a particular Property and arises during the Interim Lease Term
for such Property) that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such
Indemnitee (whether because of action or omission by such Indemnitee or
otherwise), whether or not such Indemnitee shall also be indemnified as to any
such Claim by any other Person and whether or not such Claim arises or accrues
prior to the Acquisition Date or after the Expiration Date, in any way relating
to or arising out of:

                  (i) any of the Operative Documents or any of the transactions
         contemplated thereby, and any amendment, modification or waiver in
         respect thereof;

                  (ii) the Properties or any part thereof or interest therein;

                  (iii) the purchase, design, construction, preparation,
         installation, inspection, delivery, nondelivery, acceptance, rejection,
         ownership, management, possession, operation, rental, lease, sublease,
         repossession, maintenance, repair, alteration, modification, addition
         or substitution, storage, transfer of title, redelivery, use, financing
         or refinancing by the Lessee, disposition, operation, condition, sale
         (including without limitation, any sale pursuant to Section 16.2(d) or
         16.2(f) of the Master Lease or any sale pursuant to Article XV, XVIII
         or XX of the Master Lease), return or other disposition of all or any
         part or any interest in the Property or the imposition of any Lien
         except Lessor Liens and Liens in favor of the Lenders, Lessor Trust or
         the Certificate Holders (or incurring of any liability to refund or pay
         over any amount as a result of any such Lien) thereon, including,
         without limitation: (1) Claims or penalties arising from any violation
         of law or in tort (on the basis of strict liability or otherwise), (2)
         latent or other defects, whether or not discoverable, (3) any Claim
         based upon a violation or alleged violation of the terms of any
         restriction, easement, condition or covenant or other matter affecting
         title to the Property, (4) the making of any Modifications in violation

                                     -47-
<PAGE>

         of any standards imposed by any insurance policies required to be
         maintained by Lessee or Lessee pursuant to the Lease which are in
         effect at any time with respect to the Property or any part thereof,
         (5) any Claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement with
         respect to the Property, and (6) Claims arising from any public
         improvements with respect to the Property resulting in any change or
         special assessments being levied against the Property or any plans to
         widen, modify or realign any street or highway adjacent to the
         Property, or any Claim for utility "tap-in" fees;

                  (iv) the breach by Lessee or the Guarantor of any covenant,
         representation or warranty made by it in any Operative Document or any
         certificate required to be delivered by it by any Operative Document;

                  (v) the retaining or employment of any broker, finder or
         financial advisor by any Lessee to act on its behalf in connection with
         this Participation Agreement or any other Operative Document;

                  (vi) the existence of any Lien on or with respect to the
         Property, the Improvements, any Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent, title
         thereto, or any interest therein including any Liens which arise out of
         the possession, use, occupancy, construction, repair or rebuilding of
         the Property or by reason of labor or materials furnished or claimed to
         have been furnished to the Lessee, or any of its contractors or agents
         or by reason of the financing of any personalty or equipment purchased
         or leased by the Lessee or Modifications constructed by the Lessee,
         except Lessor Liens and Liens in favor of the Lenders or the
         Certificate Holders;

                  (vii) subject to the accuracy of any Participant's
         representation set forth in Section 8.1(a), as to such Participant, the
         transactions contemplated by the Lease or by any other Operative
         Document, in respect of the application of Parts 4 and 5 of Subtitle B
         of Title I of ERISA and any prohibited transaction described in Section
         4975(c) of the Code; and

                (viii)     any and all taxes in connection with the Lease.

Provided, however, that the Lessee shall not be required to indemnify any
Indemnitee under this Section 13.1 for any of the following: (1) any Claim to
the extent resulting from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any
Indemnitee (it being understood that the Lessee shall be required to indemnify
an Indemnitee even if the ordinary (but not gross) negligence of such Indemnitee
caused or contributed to such Claim) or the breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of such Indemnitee set forth in any Operative Document, (2)
any Claim resulting from Lessor Liens, (3) any Claim arising from a breach or
alleged breach by any Indemnitee of any Operative Document or any agreement
entered into in connection with the assignment or participation of any Loan or
Certificate Holder Amount, and (4) any Claim arising in respect to the Property
to the extent attributable to acts or events occurring in the period after the
Lessee ceases to lease the Property from the Lessor Trust under the related
Lease, provided that the facts supporting such Claim occur after such period. It
is expressly understood and agreed that the indemnity provided for herein shall
survive the expiration or termination of and shall be separate and independent
from any remedy under the Lease or any other Operative Document. Without

                                     -48-
<PAGE>

limiting the express rights of any Indemnitee under this Section 13.1, this
Section 13.1 shall be construed as an indemnity only and not a guaranty of
residual value of the Property or as a guaranty of the Notes.

        Section 13.2. End of Term Indemnity. (a) If the Lessee elects (on behalf
of the Lessee) the Remarketing Option and there would, after giving effect to
the proposed remarketing transaction, be a Shortfall Amount, then prior to the
Expiration Date and as a condition to the Lessee's right to complete the
remarketing of the Property pursuant to Article XX of the Master Lease, the
Lessee shall cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent and Agent
Certificate Holder at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the
Expiration Date, at the Lessee's sole cost and expense, a report from the
Appraiser in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent Certificate Holder,
the Administrative Agent and the Participants (the "End of the Term Report")
which shall state the appraiser's conclusions as to the reason for any decline
in the Fair Market Sales Value of the Property from that anticipated for such
date in the As-Completed Appraisal delivered with respect to the Property or any
Improvements to the Property.

         (b) On or prior to the Expiration Date the Lessee shall pay to the
Administrative Agent and Agent Certificate Holder for the account of each of the
Lenders and Certificate Holders an amount (not to exceed the Shortfall Amount)
equal to the portion of the Shortfall Amount that the End of the Term Report
demonstrates was the result of a decline in the Fair Market Sales Value of the
Property due to:

                  (i) extraordinary use; failure to maintain, repair, restore,
         rebuild or replace; failure to comply with all applicable laws; failure
         to use; workmanship; method of installation or removal or maintenance,
         repair, rebuilding or replacement (excepting in each case ordinary wear
         and tear and except as otherwise provided in the Lease); or

                  (ii) any change(s) to the Plans and Specifications or any
         Modification made to, or any rebuilding of, the Property or any part
         thereof by the Lessee, the Construction Agent or any sublessee, in each
         case not in compliance with the Operative Documents or;

                  (iii) contamination at the Property resulting from any
         Hazardous Activity, Hazardous Materials or Environmental Violations
         other than as disclosed to the Certificate Holders in writing in
         connection with the Acquisition Date, the indemnity for which shall not
         exceed the cost of the remediation thereof, or

                  (iv) any restoration or rebuilding carried out by the Lessee
         or Construction Agent, or

                  (v) any condemnation of any portion of the Property pursuant
         to Article XIV of the Master Lease, or

                  (vi) any use of the Property or any part thereof by the Lessee
         other than for its intended purposes as contemplated by the Appraisal,
         or

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

                  (vii) any grant, release, dedication, transfer, annexation or
         amendment made pursuant to Section 11.2 of the Master Lease, or

                  (viii) the failure of the Lessor Trust to have good and
         marketable title to the Property free and clear of all Liens (other
         than Permitted Property Liens), or

                  (ix) the existence of any sublease relating to the Properties
         that shall survive the Expiration Date.

The indemnity set forth in this Section 13.2 is not a guaranty of the residual
value or Certificate Holder Amount with respect to any Property.

        Section 13.3. Environmental Indemnity. Without limitation of the other
provisions of this Article XIII but subject to the provisions of the
Construction Agency Agreement during the Interim Lease Period for any
Uncompleted Property, the Lessee and the Guarantor hereby agree to indemnify,
hold harmless and defend each Indemnitee from and against any and all claims
(including, without limitation, third party claims for personal injury or real
or personal property damage), losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties,
charges, administrative and judicial proceedings, judgments, remedial actions,
requirements, enforcement actions of any kind, and all reasonable and documented
costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (including but not limited
to reasonable and documented attorneys' and/or paralegals' fees and expenses and
costs incurred in connection with any investigation or monitoring of site
conditions or any clean-up, remedial, removal or restoration work with respect
to the Property undertaken or required by any federal, state or local
Governmental Authority), arising or asserted under any Environmental Laws, and
arising in whole or in part, out of:

                  (a) the presence on or under the Property of any Hazardous
         Materials, or any Releases of any Hazardous Materials on, under, from
         or at the Property;

                  (b) any activity, including, without limitation, construction,
         carried on or undertaken on or off the Property, whether by the Lessee
         (or any predecessor in title) or any employees, agents, contractors or
         subcontractors of the Lessee (or any predecessor in title), or in
         connection with the handling, treatment, removal, storage,
         decontamination, clean-up, transport or disposal of any Hazardous
         Materials that at any time are located or present on or under or that
         at any time migrate, flow, percolate, diffuse or in any way move onto
         or off the Property;

                  (c) with respect to any Hazardous Materials at the Property,
         loss of or damage to any property or the environment (including,
         without limitation, clean-up costs, response costs, remediation and
         removal costs, costs of corrective action, costs of financial
         assurance, fines and penalties and natural resource damages), or death
         or injury to any Person, and all expenses associated with the
         protection of wildlife, aquatic species, vegetation, flora and fauna,
         and any mitigative action required by or under Environmental Laws; or


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

                  (d) any noncompliance with Environmental Laws, or any act or
         omission causing an environmental condition at the Property that
         requires remediation or causing any Governmental Authority to record a
         Lien pursuant to Environmental Laws on the land record of the Property;
         or

                  (e) any residual contamination on or under the Property,
         including any contamination affecting any natural resources, and any
         contamination of any property or natural resources arising in
         connection with the generation, use, handling, storage, transport or
         disposal of any Hazardous Material associated with the Property, and
         irrespective of whether any of such activities were or will be
         undertaken in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, codes and
         ordinances;

provided, however, that the Lessee and the Guarantor shall not be required to
indemnify any Indemnitee under this Section 13.3 for any Claim to the extent
resulting from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee or
arising in respect to the Property to the extent attributable to acts or events
occurring in the period after the Lessee ceases to lease the Property from the
Lessor Trust under the related Lease Supplement, provided that the facts
supporting such Claim occur after such period. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the indemnity provided for herein shall survive the expiration or
termination of the Lease Term with respect to any Claim based on facts or
circumstances arising prior to or during the Lease Term, and shall be separate
and independent from any remedy under the Lease or any other Operative Document.

        Section 13.4. Proceedings in Respect of Claims. In case any action, suit
or proceeding shall be brought against any Indemnitee in respect of Claims
indemnifiable under Sections 13.1 or 13.3, such Indemnitee shall notify the
Lessee of the commencement thereof, and the Lessee shall be entitled, at the
Lessee's expense, to participate in, and, to the extent that the Lessee desires
to, assume and control the defense thereof; provided, however, that the Lessee
shall have acknowledged in writing its obligation to fully indemnify such
Indemnitee in respect of such action, suit or proceeding, and the Lessee shall
keep such Indemnitee fully apprised of the status of such action, suit or
proceeding and shall provide such Indemnitee with all information with respect
to such action, suit or proceeding as such Indemnitee shall reasonably request,
and provided, further, that the Lessee shall not be entitled to assume and
control the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding if and to the extent
that, (A) in the reasonable opinion of such Indemnitee's counsel, (x) such
action, suit or proceeding involves any risk of imposition of criminal liability
or will involve a risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of
any Lien (other than a Permitted Property Lien) on the Property or any part
thereof unless, in the case of civil liability only, the Lessee shall have
agreed in writing to be responsible for such risk or (y) the control of such
action, suit or proceeding would involve an actual or potential conflict of
interest, (B) such proceeding involves Claims not fully indemnified by the
Lessee which the Lessee and the Indemnitee have been unable to sever from the
indemnified claim(s), or (C) an Event of Default under the Lease has occurred
and is continuing. The Indemnitee will join in the Lessee's efforts to sever
such action. The Indemnitee may participate at its own expense and with its own
counsel in any proceeding conducted by the Lessee in accordance with the
foregoing. The Lessee shall not enter into any settlement or other compromise
with respect to any Claim which is entitled to be indemnified under Section 13.1
or 13.3 without prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

be unreasonably withheld in the case of a money settlement not involving an
admission of liability of such Indemnitee.

         Each Indemnitee shall at the expense of the Lessee supply the Lessee
with such information and documents reasonably requested by the Lessee as are
necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or
proceeding to the extent permitted by Section 13.1 or 13.3.

         Upon payment in full of any Claim by the Lessee pursuant to Section
13.1 or 13.3 to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, the Lessee, without any further
action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee may have
relating thereto (other than claims in respect of insurance policies maintained
by such Indemnitee at its own expense), and such Indemnitee shall execute such
instruments of assignment and conveyance, evidence of claims and payment and
such other documents, instruments and agreements as may be necessary to preserve
any such claims and otherwise cooperate with the Lessee and give such further
assurances as are necessary or advisable to enable the Lessee vigorously to
pursue such claims.

         Any amount payable to an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.3
shall be paid to such Indemnitee promptly upon receipt of a written demand
therefor from such Indemnitee, accompanied by a written statement describing in
reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the computation of the amount
so payable.

        Section 13.5.    General Tax Indemnity.  (a)  Indemnification.

                (i) Interim Lease Term. During the Interim Lease Term for each
Uncompleted Property and without limitation of the rights of any Tax Indemnitee
under Sections 13.1 and 13.3, (x) the Lessee shall pay and assume liability for,
and does hereby agree to indemnify, protect and defend the Uncompleted
Properties and Lessor Trust, and hold the Uncompleted Properties and Lessor
Trust harmless against, all Impositions on an After Tax Basis and (y) the Lessor
Trust shall (Subject to Section 15.10) pay and assume liability for, and does
hereby agree to indemnify, protect and defend the Uncompleted Properties and all
other Tax Indemnitees against (for and against which obligations of the Lessor
Trust the Lessee agrees to indemnify, protect and defend the Lessor Trust), all
Impositions on an After Tax Basis.

                (ii) Basic Lease Term. With respect to each Uncompleted
Property, commencing on the Basic Lease Term Commencement Date therefor, and,
with respect to any Improved Property, commencing on the Acquisition Date
therefor, and without limitation of the rights of any Tax Indemnitee under any
other indemnification provision of this Article XIII (including the immediately
preceding clause(i)), the Lessee shall pay and assume liability for, and does
hereby agree to indemnify, protect and defend the applicable Property and all
Tax Indemnitees, and hold them harmless against, all Impositions on an After Tax
Basis.

         (b) Contests. If any claim shall be made against any Tax Indemnitee or
if any proceeding shall be commenced against any Tax Indemnitee (including a
written notice of such proceeding) for any Imposition as to which the Lessee may
have an indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.5, or if any Tax
Indemnitee shall determine that any Imposition to which the Lessee may have an
indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.5 may be payable, such Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly (and in any event, within thirty (30) days) notify the

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

Lessee in writing (provided that failure to so notify the Lessee within thirty
(30) days shall not alter such Tax Indemnitee's rights under this Section 13.5
except to the extent such failure precludes or materially adversely affects the
ability to conduct a contest of any Impositions) and shall not take any action
with respect to such claim, proceeding or Imposition without the written consent
of the Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably
delayed) for thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice by the Lessee;
provided, however, that in the case of any such claim or proceeding, if such Tax
Indemnitee shall be required by law or regulation to take action prior to the
end of such thirty (30) day period, such Tax Indemnitee shall in such notice to
the Lessee, so inform the Lessee and such Tax Indemnitee shall not take any
action with respect to such claim, proceeding or Imposition without the consent
of the Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably
delayed) for 10 days after the receipt of such notice by the Lessee unless such
Tax Indemnitee shall be required by law or regulation to take action prior to
the end of such ten (10) day period.

         The Lessee shall be entitled for a period of thirty (30) days from
receipt of such notice from such Tax Indemnitee (or such shorter period as such
Tax Indemnitee has notified the Lessee is required by law or regulation for such
Tax Indemnitee to commence such contest), to request in writing that such Tax
Indemnitee contest the imposition of such Tax, at the Lessee's expense. If (x)
such contest can be pursued in the name of the Lessee and independently from any
other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee for which the
Lessee has not agreed to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee, (y) such contest must be
pursued in the name of such Tax Indemnitee, but can be pursued independently
from any other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee for
which the Lessee has not agreed to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee or (z) such Tax
Indemnitee so requests, then the Lessee shall be permitted to control the
contest of such claim, provided that in the case of a contest described in
clause (y), if such Tax Indemnitee determines reasonably and in good faith that
such contest by the Lessee could have a material adverse impact on the business
or operations of such Tax Indemnitee and provides a written explanation to the
Lessee of such determination, such Tax Indemnitee may elect to control or
reassert control of the contest, and provided that by taking control of the
contest, the Lessee acknowledges that it is responsible for the Imposition
ultimately determined to be due by reason of such claim, and provided, further,
that in determining the application of clauses (x) and (y) above, each Tax
Indemnitee shall take any and all reasonable steps to segregate claims for any
Taxes for which the Lessee indemnifies hereunder from Taxes for which the Lessee
is not obligated to indemnify hereunder, so that the Lessee can control the
contest of the former. In all other claims requested to be contested by the
Lessee, such Tax Indemnitee shall control the contest of such claim, acting
through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Lessee. In no event shall the
Lessee be permitted to contest (or such Tax Indemnitee required to contest) any
claim, (A) if such Tax Indemnitee provides the Lessee with a legal opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Lessee that such action, suit or proceeding
involves a risk of imposition of criminal liability or will involve a material
risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than
a Permitted Lien) on the Property or any part thereof unless, with respect to
civil liability only, the Lessee shall have agreed in writing to be responsible
for such risk, (B) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (C)

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

unless the Lessee shall have agreed to pay and shall pay, to such Tax Indemnitee
on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, losses and expenses that such Tax
Indemnitee may incur in connection with contesting such Imposition including all
reasonable legal, accounting and investigatory fees and disbursements, or (D) if
such contest shall involve the payment of the Tax prior to the contest, unless
the Lessee shall provide to such Tax Indemnitee an interest-free advance in an
amount equal to the Imposition that the Indemnitee is required to pay (with no
additional net after-tax costs to such Tax Indemnitee). In addition for Tax
Indemnitee controlled contests and claims contested in the name of such Tax
Indemnitee in a public forum, no contest shall be required: (A) unless the
amount of the potential indemnity (taking into account all similar or logically
related claims that have been or could be raised in any audit involving any or
all such Tax Indemnitees with respect to any period for which the Lessee may be
liable to pay an indemnity under this Section 13.5(b)) exceeds $100,000 and (B)
unless, if requested by such Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee shall have provided to
such Tax Indemnitee an opinion of counsel selected by the Lessee (which may be
in-house counsel) that a reasonable basis exists to contest such claim. In no
event shall a Tax Indemnitee be required to appeal an adverse judicial
determination to the United States Supreme Court.

         The party conducting the contest shall consult in good faith with the
other party and its counsel with respect to the contest of such claim for Taxes
(or claim for refund) but the decisions regarding what actions are to be taken
shall be made by the controlling party in its sole judgment, provided, however,
that if such Tax Indemnitee is the controlling party and the Lessee recommends
the acceptance of a settlement offer made by the relevant Governmental Authority
and such Tax Indemnitee rejects such settlement offer then the amount for which
the Lessee will be required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee with respect to the
Taxes subject to such offer shall not exceed the amount which it would have owed
if such settlement offer had been accepted. In addition, the controlling party
shall keep the non-controlling party reasonably informed as to the progress of
the contest, and shall provide the noncontrolling party with a copy of (or
appropriate excerpts from) and reports or claims issued by the relevant auditing
agents or taxing authority to the controlling party thereof, in connection with
such claim or the contest thereof.

         Each Tax Indemnitee shall, at the Lessee's expense, supply the Lessee
with such information and documents reasonably requested by the Lessee as are
necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or
proceeding to the extent permitted by this Section 13.5(b). Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 13.5(b) to the contrary, no Tax Indemnitee shall enter
into any settlement or other compromise or fail to appeal an adverse ruling with
respect to any claim which is entitled to be indemnified under this Section 13.5
(and with respect to which contest is required under this Section 13.5(b))
without the prior written consent of the Lessee, unless such Tax Indemnitee
waives its right to be indemnified under this Section 13.5 with respect to such
claim pursuant to the next paragraph.

         Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, a Tax
Indemnitee will not be required to contest or continue to contest (and the
Lessee shall not be permitted to contest or continue to contest) a claim with
respect to the imposition of any Tax if such Tax Indemnitee shall waive its
right to indemnification under this Section 13.5 with respect to such claim (and
any claim with respect to such year or any other taxable year the contest of
which is materially adversely affected as a result of such waiver) and returns

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

to the Lessee all amounts previously advanced to the Indemnitee with respect to
the contest of such claim.

         (c) [Intentionally omitted]


         (d) Payments. Any Imposition indemnifiable under this Section 13.5
shall be paid directly when due to the applicable taxing authority if direct
payment is practicable and permitted. If direct payment to the applicable taxing
authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made, any amount payable to a Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.5 shall be paid within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written demand therefor from such Tax Indemnitee accompanied by a
written statement describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable, but not
prior to the date that the relevant Taxes are due. Any payments made pursuant to
this Section 13.5 shall be made directly to such Tax Indemnitee entitled thereto
or the Lessee, as the case may be, in immediately available funds at such bank
or to such account as specified by the payee in written directions to the payor,
or, if no such direction shall have been given, by check of the payor payable to
the order of the payee by certified mail, postage prepaid at its address as set
forth in Schedule II hereto. Upon the request of any Tax Indemnitee with respect
to a Tax that the Lessee is required to pay, the Lessee shall furnish to such
Tax Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of a receipt for the Lessee's
payment of such Tax or such other evidence of payment as is reasonably
acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee.

         (e) Reports. In the case of any report, return or statement required to
be filed with respect to any Taxes that are subject to indemnification under
this Section 13.5 and of which the Lessee has knowledge, the Lessee shall
promptly notify such Tax Indemnitee of such requirement and, at the Lessee's
expense (i) if the Lessee is permitted by Applicable Law, timely file such
report, return or statement in its own name or (ii) if such report, return or
statement is required to be in the name of or filed by such Tax Indemnitee,
prepare and finish such statement for filing by such Tax Indemnitee in such
manner as shall be satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee and send the same to such
Tax Indemnitee for filing no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
therefor. In any case in which such Tax Indemnitee will file any such report,
return or statement, the Lessee shall, upon written request of such Tax
Indemnitee, provide such Tax Indemnitee with such information as is reasonably
necessary to allow such Tax Indemnitee to file such report, return or statement.

         (f)    [Intentionally omitted]

         (g) Tax Ownership. Each Tax Indemnitee represents and warrants that it
will not, prior to the termination of the Master Lease, claim ownership of (or
any tax benefits, including depreciation, with respect to) the Property for any
income tax purposes (unless required to do so by a Governmental Authority), it
being understood that the Lessee is and will remain the owner of the Property
for such income tax purposes until the termination of the Master Lease.

        Section 13.6. Indemnity Payments in Addition to Lease Obligations. The
Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Lessee's obligations to make indemnity
payments under this Article XIII are separate from, in addition to, and do not
reduce, the Lessee's obligations to pay any amounts owing from time to time
under the Lease.

                                      -55-

        Section 13.7. Eurodollar Rate Lending Unlawful. Notwithstanding any
other provision herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of
Law or in the interpretation or application thereof occurring after the
Documentation Date shall make it unlawful for any Participant to make, continue
or maintain Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts as contemplated by the
Operative Documents, (i) such Participant shall promptly give written notice of
such circumstances to the Lessee, the Certificate Holder Agent and the
Administrative Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such
circumstances no longer exist), (ii) the commitment of such Lender or
Certificate Holder, as the case may be, hereunder to make, continue or maintain
Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts shall forthwith be canceled and,
until such time as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Participant to make,
continue or maintain Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts, such
Participant shall then have a commitment only to make or maintain Base Rate
Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts when Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder
Amounts are requested and (c) such Participant's Loans and Certificate Holder
Amounts then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts, if any,
shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts
on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts or within such earlier period as
required by law. If any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder
Amounts occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest
Period with respect thereto, the Lessee shall pay to such Participant such
amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 13.10. In any such case,
interest and principal (if any) shall be payable contemporaneously with the
related Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts of the other Participants so
affected.

     Section 13.8. Deposits  Unavailable.  If any of the Participants shall have
determined that:

                  (i) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the
         relevant Interest Period are not available to such Participant in its
         relevant market; or

                  (ii) by reason of circumstances affecting such Participant's
         relevant market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the
         interest rate or Yield, as the case may be, applicable to such
         Participant's Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts;

then, upon notice from such Participant to the Lessee, the Certificate Holder
Agent, the Administrative Agent and the other Participants, (x) the obligations
of such Participant to make or continue any Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts
as, or to convert any Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts into Eurodollar
Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts shall be suspended, and (y) each outstanding
Eurodollar Loan/Certificate Holder Amount held by such Participant shall
automatically convert into a Base Rate Loan/Certificate Holder Amount on the
last day of the current Interest Period applicable thereto.

        Section 13.9. Increased Costs, etc. (a) If the adoption of or any change
in a Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof
applicable to any Participant, or compliance by any Participant with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Documentation
Date (or, if later, the date on which such Participant becomes a Participant):

                                     -56-
<PAGE>

                  (i) shall subject such Participant to any tax of any kind
         whatsoever with respect to any Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder
         Amounts made, continued or maintained by it or its obligation to make,
         continue or maintain Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts, or
         change the basis of taxation of payments to such Participant in respect
         thereof (except for excluded Impositions, any changes in taxes measured
         by or imposed upon the overall gross or net income, franchise or other
         taxes (imposed in lieu of such net income tax), of such Participant or
         its applicable lending office, branch, or any affiliate thereof); or

                  (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
         Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts, loans or other extensions of
         credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such
         Participant which is not otherwise included in the determination of the
         Adjusted Eurodollar Rate hereunder; or

                  (iii) shall impose on such Participant any other condition
         (excluding any Tax of any kind) whatsoever in connection with the
         Operative Documents;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Participant, by a material amount, of making, continuing or maintaining
Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts or to reduce any amount receivable
hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, upon notice to the Lessee
from such Participant, through the Administrative Agent and/or the Agent
Certificate Holder, in accordance herewith, the Lessee shall pay such
Participant any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Participant for
such increased cost or reduced amount receivable; provided that, in any such
case, the Lessee may elect to convert the Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder
Amounts made by such Participant hereunder to Base Rate Loans/Certificate Holder
Amounts by giving the Administrative Agent at least one (1) Business Day's
notice of such election, in which case the Lessee shall promptly pay to such
Participant, upon demand, without duplication, such amounts, if any, as may be
required pursuant to Section 13.10. All payments required by this Section
13.9(a) shall be made by the Lessee within ten (10) Business Days after demand
by the affected Participant. The Lessee shall not be obligated to reimburse any
Participant for any increased cost or reduced return incurred more than one
hundred eighty (180) days after the date that such Participant receives actual
notice of such increased cost or reduced return unless such Participant gives
notice thereof to the Lessee in accordance with this Section 13.9 during such
one hundred eighty (180) day period. If any Participant becomes entitled to
claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall provide
prompt notice thereof to the Lessee, through the Administrative Agent and/or the
Agent Certificate Holder, certifying (x) that one of the events described in
this clause (a) has occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of
such event, (y) as to the increased cost or reduced amount resulting from such
event and (z) as to the additional amount demanded by such Participant and a
reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof (including the method
by which such Participant allocated such amounts to the Lessee). Such a
certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this clause
submitted by such Participant, through the Administrative Agent and/or the Agent
Certificate Holder, to the Lessee shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Participation

Agreement and the payment of the Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

         (b) Each Participant shall use its reasonable efforts to reduce or
eliminate any unlawfulness or claim for compensation pursuant to Sections 13.7,
13.8 or 13.9(a), including, without limitation, a change in the office of such
Participant at which its obligations related to this Participation Agreement are
maintained if such change will cure the unlawfulness or avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment
of such Participant, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. If any such claim of
unlawfulness or for compensation shall not be eliminated or waived, the Lessee
shall have the right to replace the affected Participant with a new financial
institution that shall succeed to the rights of such Participant under this
Participation Agreement; provided, however, that such Participant shall not be
replaced hereunder until it has been paid in full such claim and all other
amounts owed to it hereunder.

       Section 13.10. Funding Losses. The Lessee agrees to indemnify each
Indemnitee and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from any loss or expense which
such Indemnitee may sustain or incur (other than through such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) as a consequence of (a) default by the Lessee
in making a borrowing of Loans or Certificate Holder Amounts which are
Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts after Lessee has given a notice
requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Participation
Agreement, (b) default by the Lessee in making any prepayment of a Loan or
Certificate Holder Amount which is a Eurodollar Loan/Certificate Holder Amount
after the Lessee has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of
this Participation Agreement, or (c) the making of a prepayment of Loans or
Certificate Holder Amounts which are Eurodollar Loans/Certificate Holder Amounts
on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.
This covenant shall survive the termination of this Participation Agreement or
any other Operative Document and the payment of the Loans, Certificate Holder
Amounts and all other amounts payable under the Operative Documents.

       Section 13.11. Capital Adequacy. (a) If the adoption of any applicable
law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or
any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Participant with any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, in each case made
subsequent to the Documentation Date has or will have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on any Participant's or its parent company's capital by a
material amount, as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to
a level below that which such Participant or its parent company could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Participant's or its parent company's policies with respect
to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from such Participant, the Lessee shall
pay to such Participant such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Participant and its parent company for such reduction (it being understood
that such parent company shall not be reimbursed to the extent its subsidiary
Participant is reimbursed by the Lessee in connection with the same or a similar
law, rule, regulation, change, request or directive applicable to such
Participant). All payments required by this Section 13.11 shall be made by the

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

Lessee within ten (10) Business Days after demand by the affected Participant.
The Lessee shall not be obligated to reimburse any Participant for any reduced
return incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date that such
Participant receives actual notice of such reduced return unless such
Participant gives notice thereof to the Lessee in accordance with this Section
13.11 during such one hundred eighty (180) day period. If any Participant
becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this clause, it
shall provide prompt written notice thereof to the Lessee, through the
Administrative Agent and/or the Agent Certificate Holder, certifying (x) that
one of the events described in this clause (a) has occurred and describing in
reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to the increased cost or
reduced amount resulting from such event and (z) as to the additional amount
demanded by such Participant and a reasonably detailed explanation of the
calculation thereof. Such a certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this clause submitted by such Participant, through the
Administrative Agent and/or the Agent Certificate Holder, to the Lessee shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Participation Agreement and the other Operative Documents
and the payment of the Loans, Certificate Holder Amounts and all other amounts
payable hereunder and thereunder.

         (b) Each Participant shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
reduce or eliminate, any claim for compensation pursuant to this Section 13.11,
including, without limitation, a change in the office of such Participant at
which its obligations related to the Operative Documents are maintained if such
change will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and
will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Participant, be otherwise
disadvantageous to it. If any such claim for compensation shall not be
eliminated or waived, the Lessee shall have the right to replace the affected
Participant with a new financial institution that shall succeed to the rights of
such Participant under the Operative Documents; provided, however, that such
Participant shall not be replaced hereunder until it has been paid in full such
claim and all other amounts owed to it hereunder.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere herein or in the other
Operative Documents, the Agent Certificate Holder shall not have any duties or

fiduciary relationship with any Certificate Holder, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Participation Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents, or
shall otherwise exist against the Agent Certificate Holder.

        Section 14.2. Delegation of Duties. The Agent Certificate Holder may
execute any of its duties hereunder or under the other Operative Documents by or
through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent Certificate Holder

attorneys in fact selected by it with reasonable care.

        Section 14.3. Agent Certificate Holder and Affiliates. The Agent
Certificate Holder shall have the same rights and powers under this
Participation Agreement and under the other Operative Documents as any other

        Section 14.7. Reliance on Communications. The Agent Certificate Holder
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or
other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to
Lessee, the Guarantor, independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Agent Certificate Holder with reasonable care). The Agent Certificate Holder may
deem and treat the Participants as the owners of their respective interests
hereunder and under the other Operative Documents for all purposes unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with the Agent Certificate Holder in accordance with Section 12.1 of the
Participation Agreement. The Agent Certificate Holder, acting in its capacity as
Agent Certificate Holder, shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to
take any action under this Participation Agreement or under any of the other
Operative Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Certificate Holders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Participants against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. The Agent Certificate Holder shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or under any of the
other Operative Documents in accordance with a request of the Certificate
Holders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all the Participants (including their successors and
assigns).

        Section 14.8. Notice of Default. The Agent Certificate Holder shall not
be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event
of Default hereunder unless the Agent Certificate Holder has received notice
from a Participant or any Lessee or the Guarantor referring to the Operative
Document, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default." In the event that the Agent Certificate Holder
receives such a notice, the Agent Certificate Holder shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Participants. The Agent Certificate Holder shall take such action
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed
by the Required Certificate Holders.

        Section 14.9. Non-Reliance on Agent Certificate Holder and Other
Participants. Each Participant expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent
Certificate Holder (other than in its role as Participant) nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made
any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent Certificate
Holder or any affiliate thereof hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of the Lessee or the Guarantor, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent Certificate Holder to any Participant.
Each Participant represents to the Agent Certificate Holder that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent Certificate Holder or any
other Participant, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
assets, operations, property, financial, and other conditions, prospects and
creditworthiness of any Lessee and the Guarantor and made its own decision to
make its proportionate share of the Advances hereunder and under the other
Operative Documents and enter into this Participation Agreement and the other
Operative Documents. Each Participant also represents that it will,

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

independently and without reliance upon the Agent Certificate Holder or any
other Participant, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals
and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Participation Agreement,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions,
prospects and creditworthiness of Lessee and the Guarantor. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Participants by the Agent Certificate Holder hereunder, the Agent Certificate
Holder shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Participant with
any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, assets,
property, financial or other conditions, prospects or creditworthiness of the
Lessee or the Guarantor which may come into the possession of the Agent
Certificate Holder or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

       Section 14.10. Indemnification. The Certificate Holders agree to
indemnify the Agent Certificate Holder in its capacity as such (to the extent
not reimbursed by the Lessee or the Guarantor and without limiting the
obligation of the Lessee and the Guarantor to do so, to the extent set forth
herein or in the other Operative Documents to which the Lessee or the Guarantor
is a party), ratably according to their respective Commitments, from and against
any and all Claims of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including
without limitation at any time following the payment of the Obligations) be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent Certificate Holder in its
capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of this Participation
Agreement or the other Operative Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or any action taken or omitted by the Agent Certificate Holder under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Certificate Holder shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such Claims resulting from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent Certificate Holder. If any
indemnity furnished to the Agent Certificate Holder for any purpose shall, in
the opinion of the Agent Certificate Holder, be insufficient or become impaired,
the Agent Certificate Holder may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not
commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment in full of
the Obligations and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other
Operative Documents.

       Section 14.11. Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of
the Agent Certificate Holder hereunder, the Agent Certificate Holder shall in
all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it
shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Certificate Holders against any
and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

       Section 14.12. Resignation and Removal. The Agent Certificate Holder may
resign at any time upon at least thirty (30) days prior notice to Lessee and the
Participants, and may be removed for cause at any time by vote of the Required
Certificate Holders and notice to the retiring Agent Certificate Holder, the
Administrative Agent and the Lessee. In the event of any such resignation or
removal, the Required Certificate Holders shall as promptly as practicable (but
with five (5) Business Days' prior written notice being given to Lessee) appoint
a successor Agent Certificate Holder, provided that such successor Agent
Certificate Holder shall be approved by Lessee, Administrative Agent, and,
unless an Event of Default is continuing, be approved by the Lessee (which

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, if the Lessee has
not responded within such five (5) Business Day period, Lessee shall be deemed
to have approved such new Agent Certificate Holder. If no successor Agent
Certificate Holder shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such
appointment within thirty (30) days after either the retiring Agent Certificate
Holder's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Certificate Holders'
vote to remove the retiring Agent Certificate Holder, then the retiring Agent
Certificate Holder may, on behalf of the Certificate Holders, appoint a
successor Agent Certificate Holder, which shall be a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof or under
the laws of another country that is doing business in the United States and
having a combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least
$100,000,000, or a wholly owned subsidiary of such bank. Upon its acceptance of
its appointment, such successor Agent Certificate Holder shall thereupon succeed
to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Agent Certificate Holder, and the retiring Agent Certificate Holder
shall be discharged from all further duties and obligations as Agent Certificate
Holder under this Participation Agreement and under the other Operative
Documents. After any retiring Agent Certificate Holder's resignation or removal
hereunder as Agent Certificate Holder, the provisions of this Participation
Agreement and of the other Operative Documents shall continue to inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
Certificate Holder under this Participation Agreement. No resignation or renewal
of the Agent Certificate Holder may become effective until a successor Agent
Certificate Holder has been appointed as provided above.

         Section 14.13. Distributions. The Agent Certificate Holder shall, as
promptly as practicable, distribute to each Participant its appropriate portion,
if any, of payments received (in good, collected funds) by the Agent Certificate
Holder from the Lessee or the Guarantor for the account of the Participants or
of any such payments so received for the account of such Participant.

         Section 14.14. Rights of Lessee. Except where Lessee is expressly
referenced in this Article XIV or Article VII or in the Lease, (w) the Agent
Certificate Holder shall act solely as agent of the Certificate Holders and does
not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or
relationship of agency or trust with or for Lessee, (x) this Article XIV is for
the benefit of the Agent Certificate Holder and the Participants only, (y)
Lessee shall have no right to enforce any part of this Article XIV and shall
have no rights as third party beneficiary or otherwise therein, and (z) this
Article XIV may be amended by the approval of Agent Certificate Holder and the
Required Participants, without any need to obtain the approval of Lessee.

transfer of any Property to the Lessor Trust, the construction of any

Certificate Holder or any Participant in any Property or any Improvements and

may waive compliance with any of the other terms, provisions or conditions of

the others that it has not retained or employed any broker, finder or financial
adviser to act on its behalf in connection with this Participation Agreement or

it authorized any broker, finder or financial adviser retained or employed by
any other Person so to act. In the event that any party retains any other
broker, finder or financial advisor, such party will promptly notify the other
parties in writing of such broker, finder or financial advisor. Any party which
is in breach of this representation shall indemnify and hold the other parties
harmless from and against any liability arising out of such breach of this
representation.

        Section 15.3. Notices. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein,
all notices, consents, directions, approvals, instructions, requests and other

the other parties hereto in accordance with this Section.

     Section 15.4. Counterparts. This Participation Agreement may be executed by
the parties hereto in separate counterparts,  each of which when so executed and
delivered  shall  be an  original,  but all  such  counterparts  shall  together
constitute but one and the same instrument.

     Section 15.5. Amendments, Etc. Neither any Operative Document nor any of

jurisdiction,   be   ineffective   to  the   extent  of  such   prohibition   or

such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

       Section 15.10. Liability Limited. (a) The parties hereto agree that
except as specifically set forth herein or in any other Operative Document, no
Certificate Holder or Owner Trustee shall have any personal liability whatsoever
to any Participant or their respective successors and assigns for any claim
based on or in respect hereof or any of the other Operative Documents or arising
in any way from the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and recourse, if
any, shall be solely had against such Certificate Holder's interest in the
Lessor Trust; provided, however, that each Certificate Holder and Owner Trustee
shall be liable in its individual capacity (a) for its own willful misconduct or
gross negligence, (b) breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants under the Operative Documents, (c) with respect to Certificate
Holders, for any Tax based on or measured by any fees, commission or
compensation received by a Certificate Holder for acting as a Certificate Holder

sentence: (i) no Certificate Holder or Owner Trustee shall have any personal
liability under any of the Operative Documents as a result of acting pursuant to
and consistent with any of the Operative Documents; (ii) all obligations of each
Certificate Holder and Owner Trustee to any Lender are solely nonrecourse
obligations except to the extent that such Certificate Holder or Owner Trustee
has received payment from others (including, without limitation, obligations
with respect to the Loans); and (iii) all such personal liability of any
Certificate Holder and Owner Trustee is expressly waived and released as a
condition of, and as consideration for, the execution and delivery of the
Operative Documents by such Certificate Holder and Owner Trustee.

         (b) No Participant shall have any obligation to any other Participant
or to the Lessee, the Certificate Holders or the Lenders with respect to

                                      -66-
<PAGE>

transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents, except those obligations
of such Participant expressly set forth in the Operative Documents or except as
set forth in the instruments delivered in connection therewith, and no
Participant shall be liable for performance by any other party hereto of such
other party's obligations under the Operative Documents except as otherwise so
set forth.

       Section 15.11. Further Assurances. The parties hereto shall promptly
cause to be taken, executed, acknowledged or delivered, at the sole expense of
the Lessee, all such further acts, conveyances, documents and assurances as the
other parties may from time to time reasonably request in order to carry out and
preserve the security interests and liens (and the priority thereof) intended to
be created pursuant to this Participation Agreement, the other Operative
Documents, and the transactions thereunder (including, without limitation, the
preparation, execution and filing of any and all Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements and other filings or registrations which the parties hereto
may from time to time request to be filed or effected). The Lessee, at its own
expense and upon prior request from any other party, shall take such action as
may be reasonably necessary (including any action specified in the preceding
sentence), or as so requested, in order to maintain and protect all security
interests provided for hereunder or under any other Operative Document.

       Section 15.12. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER
OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A
COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

       Section 15.13. Setoff. The Lenders and the Certificate Holders shall,
upon the occurrence of any Lease Event of Default or Construction Agency
Agreement Event of Default, have the right to appropriate and, subject to
Section 4.7, apply to the payment of Lessee's obligations under the Lease, the
Construction Agency Agreement and the other Operative Documents as security for
the payment of such obligations, any and all balances, credits, deposits,
accounts or moneys of Lessee then or thereafter maintained with any Lender or
any Certificate Holder. The rights of the Lenders and the Certificate Holders
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff under applicable law or otherwise) which such Person may have.

       Section 15.14. No Participant Responsible for Other Participants. The
obligations of each Participant under this Participation Agreement and the other
Operative Documents are several and not joint; and, in the event of a failure by
a Participant to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other
Operative Document, neither the Agent Certificate Holder nor the Administrative
Agent nor any other Participant (other than the defaulting Participant) shall
have any liability as a consequence thereof.

shall govern and be applicable with respect to the Interim Lease Term for each
Uncompleted Property.

         I have acted as counsel to The Robert Mondavi Corporation, a California
corporation (the "Guarantor"), and R.M.E., Inc., a California corporation (the
"Lessee") in connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of (i) the
Participation Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2000 (the "Participation
Agreement"), among the Lessee, the Guarantor, the Lessor Trust, the Owner
Trustee, the Agent Certificate Holder, the Certificate Holders, the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Arranger and (ii) each of the other Operative
Documents. Terms not defined herein have the meanings assigned to those terms in
Appendix A to the Participation Agreement. This letter is furnished to you
pursuant to Section 2.1(k)(v) of the Participation Agreement.

         I have examined the originals, or certified, conformed or reproduction
copies, of the Participation Agreement, the other Operative Documents and all
records, other agreements, instruments and documents, and have made such other
investigations, as I have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the
opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination, I have assumed with your
approval the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of the Lessee and
the Guarantor); the authenticity of documents submitted to me as originals; and
the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to
me as copies.

         As to matters of fact bearing upon the opinions set forth below, I have
relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and genuineness of
the representations and warranties made in the Operative Documents by the
various parties to the Operative Documents (other than the Lessee and the
Guarantor). In rendering such opinions, I have further relied on the following
assumptions, the accuracy of which I have not independently verified:

                  Each of the parties to the Operative Documents (other than the
         Lessee and the Guarantor) has the right, power and authority to
         execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Operative
         Documents to which it is a party, and has duly authorized the execution
         and delivery of the Operative Documents to which it is a party and the
         performance of its obligations thereunder.

                  Each of the parties to the Operative Documents (other than the
         Lessee and the Guarantor) has duly executed and delivered the Operative
         Documents to which it is a party.

                                     A-1-44
<PAGE>

                  Each of the Operative Documents constitutes the legal, valid
         and binding obligation of each party thereto (other than the Lessee and
         the Guarantor) and creates the rights and interests which it purports
         to create therein.

         Based upon the foregoing examinations and assumptions, and subject to
the exclusions and qualifications stated below, and having regard for the legal
considerations that I deem relevant, I am of the opinion that:

                    1. The Lessee and the Guarantor are corporations duly
         organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
         State of California and have full power and authority to conduct its
         business as presently conducted and to enter into and perform its
         obligations under the Operative Documents to which it is or will be a
         party. Lessee and the Guarantor are qualified to do business in the
         State of California and every other jurisdiction where such
         qualification is required, except where the failure so to qualify would
         not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                    2. The execution, delivery and performance by Lessee and the
         Guarantor of each Operative Document to which it is a party have been
         duly authorized by all necessary action on its part and each such
         Operative Document has been duly executed and delivered by such party.

                    3. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the
         Lessee or the Guarantor of any Operative Document to which it is a
         party (i) requires any approval of the stockholders or members of such
         party, or approval or consent of any trustee or holder of any of the
         such party's indebtedness or obligations; or (ii) conflicts with,
         results in any breach of or constitutes any default under, or results
         in the creation of any Lien (other than the respective rights and
         interest of the Participants as provided in the Operative Documents)
         upon the such party's property under, (A) any indenture, mortgage,
         chattel mortgage, deed of trust, lease, conditional sales contract,
         loan or credit arrangement or other material agreement or instrument by
         which such party or any of its properties may be bound, (B) such
         party's certificate of incorporation or (C) such party's by-laws
         operating agreement.

                    4. There is no action, proceeding or investigation pending
         or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened which is reasonably likely
         to result, either in any case or in the aggregate, in a Material
         Adverse Effect with respect to the Lessee or the Guarantor.

                    5. Neither the Lessee nor the Guarantor is an "investment
         company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within
         the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither
         the Lessee nor the Guarantor is subject to regulation as a "holding
         company," an "affiliate" of a "holding company," or a "subsidiary
         company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public
         Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. The proceeds of the
         Loans and the Certificate Holder Amounts, if used in accordance with
         the terms of the Operative Documents, will not result in a violation of
         Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
         System.

               FORM OF LEGAL OPINION OF FARELLA, BRAUN AND MARTEL
                                                              July 14, 2000


To the Participants, Administrative Agent,
Agent Certificate Holder, Owner Trustee and Lessor Trust
party to the Participation Agreement referred to below

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as special counsel to R.M.E., Inc., a California
corporation (the "Lessee") and The Robert Mondavi Corporation, a California
corporation (the "Guarantor") in connection with the negotiation, execution and
delivery of (i) the Participation Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2000 (the
"Participation Agreement"), among the Lessee, the Guarantor, the Lessor Trust,
the Owner Trustee, the Agent Certificate Holder, the Certificate Holders, the
Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Arranger and (ii) each of the other
Operative Documents. Terms not defined herein have the meanings assigned to
those terms in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement. This letter is
furnished to you pursuant to Section 2.1(k)(v) of the Participation Agreement.

         We have examined the originals, or certified, conformed or reproduction
copies, of the Participation Agreement, the other Operative Documents and all
records, other agreements, instruments and documents, and have made such other
investigations, as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis for the
opinions hereinafter expressed. In our examination, we have assumed with your
approval the genuineness of all signatures; the authenticity of documents
submitted to us as originals; and the conformity with authentic original
documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.

         As to matters of fact bearing upon the opinions set forth below, we
have relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and genuineness
of the representations and warranties made in the Operative Documents by the
various parties to the Operative Documents. In rendering such opinions, we have
further relied on the following assumptions, the accuracy of which we have not
independently verified:

                  Each of the parties to the Operative Documents has the right,
         power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
         under the Operative Documents to which it is a party, and has duly
         authorized the execution and delivery of the Operative Documents to
         which it is a party and the performance of its obligations thereunder.

                  Each of the parties to the Operative Documents has duly
         executed and delivered the Operative Documents to which it is a party.


                                      A-2-1
<PAGE>

                  Each of the Operative Documents constitutes the legal, valid
         and binding obligation of each party thereto (other than the Lessee and
         the Guarantor) and creates the rights and interests which it purports
         to create therein.

         Based upon the foregoing examinations and assumptions, and subject to
the exclusions and qualifications stated below, and having regard for the legal
considerations that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:

                    1. Each Operative Document to which the Lessee or the
         Guarantor is a party constitutes its legal, valid and binding
         obligation, enforceable against each such party, in accordance with its
         terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
         bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights
         generally and by general equitable principles.

                    2. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the
         Lessee or the Guarantor of any Operative Document to which it is a
         party contravenes or will contravene any Requirement of Law currently
         in effect applicable to or binding upon such party.

                    3. No authorization, consent, approval, license or formal
         exemption from, nor any filing, declaration or registration with, any
         Governmental Authority is or will be required in connection with the
         execution and delivery by the Lessee or the Guarantor of the Operative
         Documents to which it is a party, or the performance by the Lessee or
         the Guarantor of its obligations under such Operative Documents.

                    4. Neither the Notes nor the interests of the Participants
         under the Operative Documents are required to be registered under the
         Securities Act of 1933, as amended, nor is an indenture required to be
         qualified in respect thereof under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
         amended.

                    5. No registration, filing or qualification is required to
         permit the Lessor Trust to exercise remedies in the States of
         California under the Lease, and the validity and enforceability of the
         Lease will not be affected by any failure of the Lessor Trust to
         qualify.

                    6. If the transactions contemplated by the Lease are
         characterized as a lease transaction, the Lease is in form sufficient
         under the laws of the State of California to demise to the Lessee a
         valid leasehold interest in the Property. The Lease or the Memorandum
         of Lease, when recorded with the Office of the Recorder for San Joaquin
         County, will have been filed or recorded in all public offices in the
         State of California in which such filing or recording is necessary to
         provide constructive notice of the Lease to third Persons and to
         establish of record the interest of the Lessor Trust thereunder.

                    7. If the transactions as provided for in the Lease are
         characterized as a loan transaction, the Lease is in form sufficient
         under the laws of the State of California to create a valid lien or
         security interest, in favor of the Lessor Trust and to secure all the


                                      A-2-2
<PAGE>

         obligations of the Lessee under the Operative Documents, in the
         Property. The Lease or the Memorandum of Lease, when recorded with the
         Office of the Recorder for San Joaquin County, will have been filed or
         recorded in all public offices in the State of California in which such
         filing or recording is necessary to perfect the lien of the Lessor
         Trust thereunder to the extent that the Property constitutes real
         estate. The Lease provides the Lessor Trust with all remedies
         customarily obtained by lenders in the State of California in
         connection with the type of loan and security provided thereby

                    8. The Assignment of Lease and Rent is in form sufficient
         under the laws of the State of California to create a valid lien or
         security interest in favor of the Lenders in the collateral described
         therein, and when recorded with the Office of the Recorder for San
         Joaquin County, will have been filed or recorded in all public offices
         in the State of California in which such filing or recording is
         necessary to perfect the lien of the Lenders thereunder to the extent
         that such collateral constitutes real estate. The Assignment of Lease
         and Rent provides the Lenders with all remedies customarily obtained by
         lenders in the State of California in connection with the type of loan
         and security provided for by the Loan Agreement.

                    9. The UCC Financing Statements which are to be recorded or
         filed within the State of California, the forms of which are attached
         as Schedule II hereto, are in form sufficient under the laws of the
         State of California for filing or recording, and when recorded with the
         Office of the Recorder for San Joaquin County and the California
         Secretary of State will have been filed or recorded in all public
         offices in the State of California in which such filing or recording is
         necessary to perfect the interest of the Lessor Trust in the collateral
         described therein to the extent the same can be perfected by filing or
         recording in the State of California.

                   10. Except for the filings and recordings described above, no
         approval, consent, or withholding of objection on the part of, or
         filing or registration with, any governmental authority or regulatory
         body in the State of California is required to be made or taken in the
         State of California to establish, protect and preserve title to,
         interests in, liens on and security interests in the Property as
         contemplated by the Operative Documents, except for UCC continuation
         statements.

                   11. Except for federal, state and local franchise,
         withholding and income taxes, and filing or recording fees payable at
         the time of filing or recording and state, county and city real estate
         transfer taxes, no taxes, fees or other charges imposed by the State of
         California, San Joaquin County, or any other local governmental entity
         are payable by the Lessor Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Agent
         Certificate Holder or the Lenders solely as a result of the execution,
         delivery, recordation or filing (where applicable) of the Operative
         Documents and all other instruments delivered in connection with the
         transactions contemplated thereby.


                                Very truly yours,

         Re:                                Lodi 2000 Distribution Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as counsel to Lodi 2000 Distribution Trust (the "Lessor
Trust") and First Security Bank, National Association, a national banking
association (the "Trust Company"), in connection with the Trust Agreement, dated
as of July 14, 2000 (the "Trust Agreement"), between Harris Trust and Savings
Bank, as Agent Certificate Holder (the "Agent Certificate Holder") and the Trust
Company. Pursuant to the Participation Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2000 (the
"Participation Agreement"), among the Lessee, the Guarantor, the Lessor Trust,
the Agent Certificate Holder, the Lenders, the Certificate Holders, Harris Trust
and Savings Bank, as Administrative Agent and BMO Global Capital Solutions,
Inc., as Arranger, and the Trust Company, not in its individual capacity, except
as otherwise specified therein, but solely as Owner Trustee under the Trust
Agreement (the "Owner Trustee"), financing is being provided for acquisition of
certain Property. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall
have their respective defined meanings assigned thereto in Appendix A to the
Participation Agreement. This opinion is being furnished pursuant to Section
2.1(l)(v) of the Participation Agreement.

         We have examined executed counterparts or copies otherwise identified
to our satisfaction of the following documents:

                  (a)      the Participation Agreement;

                  (b)      the Trust Agreement;

                  (c)      the Master Lease;

                  (d)      the Loan Agreement;

                                      A-3-1
<PAGE>

                  (e)      the Memorandum of Master Lease;

                  (f)      the Assignment of Lease and Rent;

                  (g)      the Note being issued on the date hereof (the "Note")
                           ; and

                  (h)      the Certificate being issued on the date hereof (the
                           "Certificate") (the documents listed in paragraphs
                           (a) through (f) above being herein collectively
                           referred to as the "Operative Documents").

         We have also examined originals or copies of such other documents, such
corporate records, certificates and other statements of governmental officials
and corporate officers and other representatives of the corporations or entities
referred to herein and such other instruments as we have deemed necessary or
appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Moreover, as to certain facts
material to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied upon representations
and warranties contained in the Operative Documents.

         Based on the foregoing and upon an examination of such questions of law
as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions,
exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, we advise you that, in our
opinion:

                    1. The Trust Company is a national banking association, duly
         organized and validly existing in good standing under the federal laws
         of the United States of America. The Lessor Trust has been duly formed,
         is validly existing as a trust under the laws of the State of Utah and
         is a separate legal entity, able to sue and be sued and hold property
         in its own name. Each of the Trust Company, the Owner Trustee and the
         Lessor Trust has all necessary power and authority to execute and
         deliver, and perform its obligations under each of the Operative
         Documents to which the Trust Company, the Owner Trustee of the Lessor
         Trust, as the case may be, is a party.

                    2. To our knowledge, there are no actions or proceedings
         before any arbitrator, court, tribunal or governmental authority
         pending or threatened against or affecting the Trust Company, the Owner
         Trustee or the Lessor Trust which could reasonably be expected,
         individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on
         the validity of, or the right, power or authority of the Trust Company,
         the Owner Trustee or the Lessor Trust to enter into or perform its
         obligations under, the Operative Documents or on the assets,
         liabilities, operations, business or financial condition of the Trust
         Company, the Owner Trustee or the Lessor Trust.

                    3. On the Acquisition Date, the Lessor Trust received from
         the seller of the Property (the "Seller") such interest as the Seller
         conveyed to the Lessor Trust pursuant to the Deed, subject to the
         rights of the Lessor Trust and the Lessee under the Master Lease; and,
         to our knowledge, there exist no Liens affecting the right, title and
         interest in the Trust Estate, attributable to the Trust Company, the
         Owner Trustee or the Lessor Trust except as contemplated by the
         Operative Documents.*


--------------------------
* This opinion number 3 is to be delivered on each Acquisition Date.

<PAGE>

                    4. The Trust Agreement and each other Operative Document to
         which the Trust Company is a party have been duly authorized, executed
         and delivered by the Trust Company, and the Trust Agreement and each
         such other Operative Document to which the Trust Company is a party
         constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Trust Company,
         enforceable against the Trust Company in accordance with their
         respective terms. The Trust Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
         binding obligation of the Agent Certificate Holder enforceable against
         the Agent Certificate Holder in accordance with its terms.

                    5. Each Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee or the
         Lessor Trust is a party has been duly authorized, executed and
         delivered (and, with respect to the Note and the Certificate, issued)
         by the Owner Trustee or the Lessor Trust and constitutes a legal, valid
         and binding obligation of the Owner Trustee or the Lessor Trust,
         enforceable against the Owner Trustee or the Lessor Trust in accordance
         with its terms.

                    6. The execution, delivery and performance of each Operative
         Document to which the Trust Company, the Owner Trustee or the Lessor
         Trust, as the case may be, is a party has been duly authorized by all
         necessary action on its part and neither the authorization, execution
         and delivery thereof, nor the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated thereby, nor compliance by it with any of the terms and
         provisions thereof (i) does or will require, to our knowledge, any
         approval or consent of any trustee or holder of any of the Trust
         Company's or the Lessor Trust's indebtedness or obligations; (ii) does
         or will contravene any current State of Utah or United States federal
         law, governmental rule or regulations relating to the Trust Company's
         banking or trust powers; (iii) does or will contravene any current
         State of Utah or United States federal law, governmental rule or
         regulation relating to the Lessor Trust's power or the provisions of
         the Trust Agreement; (iv) does or will contravene or result in any
         breach of or constitute any default under, or result in the creation of
         any Lien upon any of (x) the Trust Company's property under, its
         charter or by-laws, or, to our knowledge, any agreement or instrument
         to which it is a party or by which it or its properties may be bound or
         affected, or (y) the Lessor Trust's property under the Trust Agreement,
         or to our knowledge, any agreement or instrument to which it is a party
         or by which it or its properties may be bound or affected; or (v) does
         or will require the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to,
         the registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of
         any governmental authority or agency of the United States or the State

                    7. To our knowledge, neither the Lessor Trust nor any Person
         authorized by the Lessor Trust to act on its behalf has offered or sold
         any interest in respect of the Lease, or in any similar security

         the purposes of the Securities Act would be deemed to be part of the
         same offering as the offering of the aforementioned securities to, or
         solicited any offer to acquire any of the same from, any Person except

         The foregoing opinions are subject to the following assumptions,
exceptions and qualifications:

                    A. The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the
         State of Utah (in respect of the Trust Company, the Owner Trustee and
         the Lessor Trust) and the federal laws of the United States of America
         governing the banking and trust powers of the Trust Company. In
         addition, we express no opinion with respect to (i) federal securities
         laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (except as set
         forth in paragraph 7 above), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
         amended, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or (ii) state
         securities or blue sky laws. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate
         to the validity and enforceability in Utah of the Operative Documents
         which are expressed to be governed by the laws of any jurisdiction
         other than the State of Utah, we have assumed that such Operative
         Documents constitute legal, valid and binding instruments under such
         laws (as to which we express no opinion).

                    B. The foregoing opinions regarding the enforceability of
         any document are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, receivership and
         similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally,
         and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
         enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                    C. We have assumed the due authorization, execution or
         delivery by each of the parties thereto, other than the Trust Company,
         the Owner Trustee and the Lessor Trust, of each of the Operative
         Documents to which each is a party and that each of such parties has
         the full power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver each
         such document.

                    D. We have assumed that all signatures (other than those of
         the Trust Company, the Owner Trustee and the Lessor Trust) on documents
         and instruments examined by us are genuine, that all documents and
         instruments submitted to us as originals are authentic, and that all
         documents and instruments submitted to us as copies conform with the
         originals, which facts we have not independently verified.

                    E. We have  assumed  that the  Operative  Documents  and the
               transactions contemplated thereby are not within the prohibitions
               of Section 406 of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of
               1974.

         This opinion is rendered solely for your benefit and that of your
successors and assigns and may not be relied upon by any person or entity for
any purpose without prior written consent.

                                Very truly yours,


                                      A-3-4

                                  MASTER LEASE

         Section 2.1. Acceptance and Lease of Property. Subject to the
conditions set forth in the Participation Agreement, including without
limitation the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI
thereof, the Lessor Trust hereby agrees to accept, pursuant to the terms of the
Participation Agreement, delivery on each Acquisition Date of the Land or
leasehold interest therein, as applicable, to be delivered by the seller or
ground lessor of the Land on such Acquisition Date, and simultaneously to demise
and lease to the Lessee hereunder and under the Lease Supplement for the Lease
Term, the Lessor Trust's interest in such Land, together with any Improvements
which thereafter may be constructed on such Land pursuant to the Construction
Agency Agreement or this Master Lease, and the Lessee hereby agrees, expressly
for the direct benefit of the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder and the
Certificate Holders, to lease from the Lessor Trust for the Lease Term the
interest of the Lessor Trust in such Land identified in the Lease Supplement,
together with any Improvements which thereafter may be constructed on such Land
pursuant to the Construction Agency Agreement and this Master Lease.

         Section 2.2. Acceptance Procedure. The Lessee hereby agrees that the
execution and delivery by it of a Lease Supplement on or as of each Acquisition
Date shall, without further act, constitute the irrevocable acceptance by the
Lessee of the Property set forth in such Lease Supplement for all purposes of
this Master Lease and the other Operative Documents on the terms set forth
therein and herein, and that such Property, together with any Improvements
constructed on the Property pursuant to the Construction Agency Agreement and
this Master Lease, shall be deemed to be included in the leasehold estate of
this Master Lease and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Master Lease as of the Acquisition Date.

         Section 2.3. Lease Term. The Lease Term for each Uncompleted Property
shall consist of an interim lease term (the "Interim Lease Term") and a basic
lease term (the "Basic Lease Term") and the Lease Term for each Improved
Property shall consist of a Basic Lease Term only. The Interim Lease Term of
this Master Lease shall commence on (and include) the Acquisition Date for each
Uncompleted Property and end on (but exclude) the Completion Date for such
Property. The Basic Lease Term of this Master Lease for each Property shall be
as follows: (a) with respect to each Uncompleted Property, the Basic Lease Term
shall commence on (and include) the Completion Date for such Property and end on

                                       2
<PAGE>

(but exclude) the Expiration Date and (b) with respect to each Improved
Property, the Basic Lease Term shall commence on (and include) the Acquisition
Date of such Property and end on (but exclude) the Expiration Date.

representation or warranty, express or implied, by Lessor Trust, Agent
Certificate Holder or any Certificate Holder and subject to the rights of
parties in possession, the existing state of title (including, without

of Law. The Lessee shall not in any event have any recourse against the Lessor
Trust, Agent Certificate Holder or any Certificate Holder for any defect in or
exception to title to any Property or leasehold interest therein other than
resulting from Lessor Liens attributable to the Lessor Trust, Agent Certificate
Holder or such Certificate Holder.


                                   ARTICLE III


                                 PAYMENT OF RENT

     Section 3.1.  Rent.  (a) During the Lease Term,  the Lessee shall pay Basic
Rent to the Lessor Trust on each  Scheduled  Payment  Date, on the date required
under  Section  20.2(h)  in  connection  with  the  Lessee's   exercise  of  the
Remarketing Option and, with respect to any Property,  on any date on which this
Master Lease shall terminate with respect to such Property; provided that during
the Interim Lease Term of any  Uncompleted  Property the Lessee's  obligation to
pay Basic Rent shall be subject to the limitations set forth in the Construction
Agency Agreement.

         (b) Neither the Lessee's inability or failure to take possession of all
or any portion of any Property when delivered by the Lessor Trust, nor the
inability or failure of the Lessor Trust to deliver all or any portion of any
Property to the Lessee on or before the Acquisition Date, whether or not
attributable to any act or omission of the Lessee or any act or omission of the
Lessor Trust or any Certificate Holder, or for any other reason whatsoever,
shall delay or otherwise affect such Lessee's obligation to pay Rent for such
Property in accordance with the terms of this Master Lease.

     Section 3.2.  Payment of Rent.  Rent shall be paid  absolutely  net to each
Person  entitled  thereto,  so that this Master Lease shall yield to such Person
the full amount thereof, without setoff, deduction or reduction.

     Section 3.3. Supplemental Rent. The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor Trust or
any other Person entitled thereto any and all Supplemental  Rent promptly as the
same  shall  become  due  and  payable,  and  if the  Lessee  fails  to pay  any
Supplemental  Rent  and such  failure  shall  continue  beyond  the cure  period
provided in Section 16.1(b),  the Lessor Trust and such other Persons shall have
all  rights,  powers  and  remedies  provided  for herein or by law or equity or
otherwise in the case of nonpayment  of Basic Rent.  The Lessee shall pay to the
Lessor Trust, as Supplemental  Rent,  among other things,  (i) all rent,  taxes,
insurance  and any other  amounts  payable by Lessor  Trust as Tenant  under any
ground lease which is subjected to this Master Lease and (ii) on demand,  to the
extent permitted by applicable  Requirements of Law,  interest at the applicable
Overdue Rate on any  installment  of Basic Rent not paid when due for the period


                                       3
<PAGE>

for which the same shall be overdue and on any payment of Supplemental  Rent not
paid when due for the period from the due date until the same shall be paid. The
expiration or other  termination  of the Lessee's  obligations to pay Basic Rent
hereunder  shall not limit or modify the  obligations of the Lessee with respect
to Supplemental  Rent. Unless expressly  provided otherwise in this Master Lease
or in the  Participation  Agreement,  in the event of any failure on the part of
the  Lessee to pay and  discharge  any  Supplemental  Rent as and when due,  the
Lessee shall also promptly pay and discharge any fine, penalty, interest or cost
which may be assessed  or added  against  any  Participant  by a third party for
nonpayment or late payment of such  Supplemental  Rent,  all of which shall also
constitute Supplemental Rent.

         Section 3.4. Method of Payment. Each payment of Rent payable by the
Lessee to the Lessor Trust under this Lease or any other Operative Document
shall be made by the Lessee to the Administrative Agent as assignee of the
Lessor Trust under the Assignment of Lease and Rent (or, if all Loans and all
other amounts owing to the Lenders under the Loan Agreement and the other
Operative Documents have been paid in full and all Commitments of the Lenders
have been permanently terminated, to the Agent Certificate Holder) prior to
12:00 (Noon), Chicago time to the Account in immediately available funds
consisting of lawful currency of the United States of America on the date when
such payment shall be due. Payments received after 12:00 (Noon), Chicago time on
the date due shall for the purpose of Section 16.1 hereof be deemed received on
such day; provided, however, that for the purposes of the second sentence of
Section 3.3, such payments shall be deemed received on the next succeeding
Business Day and shall accrue interest at the Overdue Rate as provided in such
Section 3.3.


                                   ARTICLE IV


                        QUIET ENJOYMENT; RIGHT TO INSPECT

         Section 4.1. Quiet Enjoyment. Subject to the terms of each of the
Operative Documents, the Lessee shall peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy
each Property for the Lease Term, free of any claim or other action by the
Lessor Trust or the Certificate Holders or anyone claiming by, through or under
the Lessor Trust or the Certificate Holders with respect to any matters arising
from and after the Acquisition Date. Such right of quiet enjoyment is
independent of, and shall not affect the rights of the Lessor Trust or the
Certificate Holders (or anyone claiming by, through or under the Agent
Certificate Holder or the Certificate Holders) otherwise to initiate legal
action to enforce, the obligations of the Lessee under this Master Lease.

         Section 4.2. Right to Inspect. During the Lease Term, the Lessee shall
upon reasonable notice (except that no notice shall be required if a Lease Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing), and from time to time, permit the
Agent Certificate Holder, any Certificate Holder, the Administrative Agent, any
Lender, and their respective authorized representatives to inspect the Property
subject to this Master Lease during normal business hours.

                                    ARTICLE V


                                 NET LEASE, ETC.

         Section 5.1. Net Lease. This Master Lease shall constitute a net lease.
Any present or future law to the contrary notwithstanding, this Master Lease
shall not terminate, nor shall the Lessee be entitled to any abatement,
suspension, deferment, reduction, setoff, counterclaim, or defense with respect
to the Rent, nor shall the obligations of the Lessee hereunder be affected
(except as expressly herein permitted and by performance of the obligations in
connection therewith) by reason of: (i) any defect in the condition,
merchantability, design, construction, quality or fitness for use of any
Property or any part thereof, or the failure of any Property to comply with all
Requirements of Law, including any inability to occupy or use any Property by
reason of such non-compliance; (ii) any damage to, removal, abandonment,
salvage, loss, contamination of or Release from, scrapping or destruction of or
any requisition or taking of any Property or any part thereof; (iii) any
restriction, prevention or curtailment of or interference with the construction
on or any use of any Property or any part thereof including eviction; (iv) any
defect in title of or rights to any Property or any Lien on such title or rights
or on any Property (other than Lessor Liens); (v) any change, waiver, extension,
indulgence or other action or omission or breach in respect of any obligation or
liability of or by the Administrative Agent, the Lessor Trust, the Agent
Certificate Holder or any Participant; (vi) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like
proceedings relating to the Lessee, the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, the
Lessor Trust, any Participant or any other Person, or any action taken with
respect to this Master Lease by any trustee or receiver of the Lessee, the
Guarantor, the Administrative Agent, the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate
Holder, any Participant or any other Person, or by any court in any such
proceeding; (vii) any claim that the Lessee or the Guarantor has or might have
against any Person, including without limitation the Administrative Agent, the
Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder, any Participant, or any vendor,
manufacturer, contractor of or for any Property; (viii) any failure on the part
of the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder or any other Certificate
Holder to perform or comply with any of the terms of this Master Lease (other
than performance by the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder or the
Certificate Holders of their obligations set forth in Section 2.1 hereof), of
any other Operative Document or of any other agreement; (ix) any invalidity or
unenforceability or illegality or disaffirmance of this Master Lease against or
by the Lessee or the Guarantor or any provision hereof or any of the other
Operative Documents or any provision of any thereof; (x) the impossibility or
illegality of performance by the Lessee, the Guarantor, the Lessor Trust, the
Agent Certificate Holder, the Certificate Holders or all of them; (xi) any
action by any court, administrative agency or other Governmental Authority; or
(xii) any other cause or circumstances whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing and whether or not the Lessee shall have notice or knowledge of any of
the foregoing. The Lessee's agreement in the preceding sentence shall not affect
any claim, action or right the Lessee may have against the Lessor Trust, the
Agent Certificate Holder, the Certificate Holders or any other Participants. The
parties intend that the obligations of the Lessee hereunder shall be covenants
and agreements that are separate and independent from any obligations of the
Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder or the Certificate Holders hereunder
or under any other Operative Documents, and the obligations of the Lessee shall
continue unaffected unless such obligations shall have been modified or
terminated in accordance with an express provision of this Master Lease.

         Section 5.2. No Termination or Abatement. The Lessee shall remain
obligated under this Master Lease in accordance with its terms and shall not
take any action to terminate, rescind or avoid this Master Lease (except as
provided herein), notwithstanding any action for bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other proceeding affecting any
Participant, or any action with respect to this Master Lease which may be taken
by any trustee, receiver or liquidator of any Participant or by any court with
respect to any Participant. The Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by
law, all right (i) to terminate or surrender this Master Lease (except as
provided herein) or (ii) to avail itself of any abatement, suspension,
deferment, reduction, setoff, counterclaim or defense with respect to any Rent.
The Lessee shall remain obligated under this Master Lease in accordance with its
terms and the Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, any and all
rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise to modify or to avoid
strict compliance with its obligations under this Master Lease. Notwithstanding
any such statute or otherwise, the Lessee shall be bound by all of the terms and
conditions contained in this Master Lease and the Lease Supplement.


                                   ARTICLE VI

         Section 6.1. Subletting. The Lessee may sublease the Property or any
portion thereof to any Person; provided, however, that: (a) no sublease or other
relinquishment of possession of the Property shall in any way discharge or
diminish any of the Lessee's obligations to the Lessor Trust, the Agent
Certificate Holder or the Certificate Holders hereunder and Lessee shall remain
directly and primarily liable under this Master Lease and the Lease Supplement;

subordinated to this Master Lease and the Lease Supplement and to the rights of
the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder and the Certificate Holders
hereunder; (c) each sublease shall expressly provide for the surrender of the
Property or portion thereof by the applicable sublessee at the election of the
Administrative Agent or the Agent Certificate Holder (as applicable) after the

provide for termination prior to the Expiration Date unless the Lessee elects to
purchase the Property pursuant to Section 18.1.

<PAGE>

               (a) except for any Modification required to be made pursuant to a
          Requirement of Law (a "Required Modification"),  no Modification shall
          be made if it would  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value or

          any alterations (other than Required  Modifications and/or alterations
          authorized by the  Construction  Agency  Agreement) that shall cost in

CERTIFICATE HOLDER NOR ANY CERTIFICATE HOLDER NOR ANY LENDER IS OR SHALL BE
LIABLE FOR ANY LABOR, SERVICES OR MATERIALS FURNISHED OR TO BE FURNISHED TO THE
LESSEE, OR TO ANYONE HOLDING ANY PROPERTY OR ANY PART THEREOF THROUGH OR UNDER

(including, without limitation, all applicable zoning, planning, building and

architectural approval requirements), (iv) all governmental consents or

such grant, release, dedication, transfer or amendment had not been effected,
and (vi) the Lessee shall pay and perform any obligations of the Lessor Trust,
the Agent Certificate Holder and the Certificate Holders under such grant,

(a) a test, challenge, appeal or proceeding for review of any Applicable Law or
any Lien, encumbrance, levy, attachment or encroachment relating to any Property
shall be prosecuted diligently and in good faith in appropriate proceedings by
the Lessee, or (b) compliance with such Applicable Law shall have been excused
or exempted by a valid nonconforming use, variance permit, waiver, extension or
forbearance, Lessee shall not be required to comply with such Applicable Law or
any Lien, encumbrance, levy, attachment or encroachment but only if and so long
as any such test, challenge, appeal, proceeding, waiver, extension, forbearance
or noncompliance shall not, in the reasonable opinion of the Agent Certificate
Holder and the Administrative Agent, involve (A) any risk of criminal liability
being imposed on Lessor Trust, any Certificate Holder or any Lender or (B) any
risk of (1) foreclosure, forfeiture or loss of any Property, or any material
part thereof, or (2) the nonpayment of Rent or (C) any substantial risk of (1)

any Lender, any Certificate Holder, or any Property unless the Lessee shall have
otherwise bonded or secured such amounts in a manner satisfactory to the Agent
Certificate Holder or the applicable Participant(s), as the case may be, or (3)
enjoinment of, or interference with, the use, possession or disposition of any
Property in any material respect.

         Neither the Lessor Trust, nor the Agent Certificate Holder nor any
Certificate Holder will be required to join in any proceedings pursuant to this
Section 12.1 unless a provision of any Applicable Law requires or, in the good
faith opinion of the Lessee, it is advisable for the prosecution of such
contest, that such proceedings be brought by or in the name of such party; and
in that event such party will join in the proceedings or permit them or any part
thereof to be brought in its name if and so long as (i) the Lessee has not
elected the Remarketing Option, and (ii) the Lessee pays all related expenses
and indemnities such party with respect to such proceedings.

claims for injuries or death sustained by persons or damage to property while on


                                       12
<PAGE>

such Property and such other public liability coverages as are ordinarily
procured by the Lessee or its Affiliates who own or operate similar properties,
but in any case shall provide liability coverage of at least $3,000,000 per
occurrence. Such insurance shall be on terms and in amounts that are no less
favorable than insurance maintained by the Lessee or such Affiliates with
respect to similar properties that they own. The policy shall be endorsed to
name the Lessor Trust, the Trust Company, the Agent Certificate Holder, the
Administrative Agent and each Participant as additional insureds. The policy
shall also specifically provide that the policy shall be considered primary
insurance which shall apply to any loss or claim before any contribution by any
insurance which the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder, the
Administrative Agent and any Participant may have in force.

     (b) Worker's  Compensation  Laws.  Lessee shall, in the construction of the
Improvements  (including in connection with any  Modifications  thereof) and the
operation of the  Property,  comply with the  applicable  workers'  compensation
laws.

     (c)  Hazard  and Other  Insurance.  During  the Basic  Lease  Term for each
Property,  Lessee shall keep, or cause to be kept, each Property insured against
loss or damage by fire, windstorm, flood and other risks on terms and in amounts
that are no less  favorable than  insurance  covering  other similar  properties
owned by Lessee or its Affiliates. All insurance proceeds in respect of any loss
or occurrence for which the proceeds  related thereto are (i) less than or equal
to $1,000,000,  in the absence of the occurrence and  continuance of an Event of
Default,  shall be adjusted by and paid to the Lessee for application toward the
reconstruction,  repair or refurbishment of the Property,  and (ii) greater than
$1,000,000  the Lessee and the Agent  Certificate  Holder shall work together to
jointly  resolve such  insurance  claim (unless an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing,  in which case such proceeds shall be adjusted  solely by the
Agent  Certificate  Holder)  and  held  by  the  Agent  Certificate  Holder  for
application in accordance with Article XIV.

        Section 13.2. Interim Lease Term. During the Interim Lease Term for each
Uncompleted Property, the Lessee shall procure and carry and/or cause its
contractors and subcontractors, as applicable, to carry insurance with respect
to each such Property as set forth in Section 2.8 of the Construction Agency
Agreement; provided that Lessee shall be reimbursed for the cost of such
insurance pursuant to the Construction Agency Agreement.

        Section 13.3. Insurance Coverage. (a) Lessee shall furnish the Lessor
Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder and the Administrative Agent with
certificates showing the insurance required under Sections 13.1 and 13.2 to be
in effect and naming the Lessor Trust, the Trust Company, the Agent Certificate
Holder, the Administrative Agent and each Participant as additional insureds
with respect to liability coverage (excluding worker's compensation insurance),
naming the Lessor Trust, the Trust Company, the Agent Certificate Holder, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the Certificate Holders and Lessee as
their interests may appear with respect to casualty coverage and naming the
Agent Certificate Holder on behalf of the Certificate Holders as loss payee with
respect to casualty coverage and showing the mortgagee endorsement required by
Section 13.3(c) with respect to such coverage. All insurance required under
Section 13.1 shall be at the cost and expense of Lessee. Such certificates shall
include a provision for no less than thirty (30) days' advance written notice by
the insurer to the Agent Certificate Holder and the Administrative Agent in the


                                       13
<PAGE>

event of cancellation or reduction of such insurance. In addition, Lessee shall
cause the Lessor Trust, the Trust Company, the Agent Certificate Holder, the
Administrative Agent and each Participant to be named as additional insureds
under each liability policy maintained in connection with the Construction of
any Improvements or Modifications.

     (b) The Lessee  agrees that the  insurance  policy or policies  required by
Section  13.1(a)  shall  include an  appropriate  clause  pursuant to which such
policy shall provide that it will not be invalidated should the Lessee waive, in
writing,  prior to a loss,  any or all rights of recovery  against any party for
losses  covered by such  policy,  and that the  insurance in favor of the Lessor
Trust,  the Trust Company,  the Agent  Certificate  Holder,  the  Administrative
Agent, the Certificate Holders and the Lenders and their respective rights under
and interests in such policies shall not be invalidated or reduced by any act or
omission (including breach of warranty) or negligence of the Lessee or any other
Person having any interest in the Property  other than the  Certificate  Holders
and the Lenders to the extent permitted by law. The Lessee hereby waives any and
all such rights  against the Lessor Trust,  the Trust Company,  the  Certificate
Holders and the Lenders to the extent of payments made under such policies.

     (c) All such insurance  shall be written by reputable  insurance  companies
that are  financially  sound and solvent and  otherwise  reasonably  appropriate
considering  the amount and type of insurance  being provided by such companies.
Any  insurance  company  selected by Lessee  which is rated in Best's  Insurance
Guide or any successor  thereto (or if there be none, an  organization  having a
similar national  reputation) shall have a general  policyholder  rating of "A-"
and a financial size rating of at least "VII" or be otherwise  acceptable to the
Lenders and the Certificate  Holders. All insurance policies required by Section
13.1(c) shall  include a standard form  beneficiary  or trustee  endorsement  in
favor of the Lessor Trust,  the Trust  Company,  the Agent  Certificate  Holder,
Administrative Agent and the Participants.

     (d)  Neither  the  Lessor  Trust,  nor the  Trust  Company,  nor the  Agent
Certificate  Holder nor any of the  Certificate  Holders  shall  carry  separate
insurance  concurrent in kind or form or  contributing in the event of loss with
any insurance required under this Article XIII except that the Lessor Trust, the
Trust Company,  the Agent Certificate  Holder and any Certificate Holder may, at
such party's  expense,  carry  separate  liability  insurance so long as (i) the
Lessee's  insurance  is  designated  as  primary  and  in  no  event  excess  or
contributory  to any insurance such party may have in force which would apply to
a loss covered  under the Lessee's  policy and (ii) each such  insurance  policy
will not cause Lessee's insurance required under this Article XIII to be subject
to a coinsurance exception of any kind.

     (e) The Lessee shall pay as they become due all premiums for the  insurance
required by Section  13.1 and  Section  13.2,  and shall  renew or replace  each
policy  prior to the  expiration  date  thereof;  provided  that Lessee shall be
reimbursed  for the cost of all  insurance  during the Interim  Lease Term of an
Uncompleted  Property pursuant to the Construction Agency Agreement.  Throughout
the Lease Term, at the time each of the Lessee's  insurance  policies is renewed
(but in no event less frequently than once each year),  the Lessee shall deliver
to the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder and the  Administrative  Agent
certificates of insurance evidencing that all insurance required by this Article
XIII is being maintained by the Lessee and is in effect.

directly to the Administrative Agent (as assignee of the Lessors), or if
received by the Lessee, shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent, to be
applied by the Administrative Agent as set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the
Construction Agency Agreement, and (y) if the use, access, occupancy, easement
rights or title to any Property or any part thereof is the subject of a
Condemnation during the Interim Lease Term for such Property, then any award or
compensation relating thereto shall be paid to the Administrative Agent (as
assignee of the Lessors) or if received by the Lessee, shall be paid over to the
Administrative Agent, to be applied by the Administrative Agent as set forth in
Section 3.5(b) of the Construction Agency Agreement.

                (ii) Basic Lease Term. Subject to the provisions of this Article
XIV, (x) if all or a portion of any Property is damaged or destroyed in whole or
in part by a Casualty during the Basic Lease Term for such Property, any
insurance proceeds payable with respect to such Casualty shall be paid directly
to the Lessee, or if received by Administrative Agent or any Participant, shall
be paid over to the Lessee for the reconstruction, refurbishment and repair of
the affected Property, and (y) if the use, access, occupancy, easement rights or
title to any Property or any part thereof is the subject of a Condemnation
during the Basic Lease Term for such Property, then any award or compensation
relating thereto shall be paid to the Lessee ; provided, however, that, in each
case, if (A) any Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or
(B) such Casualty or Condemnation is an Event of Loss, then such award,


                                       15
<PAGE>

compensation or insurance proceeds shall be paid directly to the Administrative
Agent (as assignee of the Certificate Holders) or, if received by the Lessee,
shall be held in trust for the Participants and shall be paid over by the Lessee
to the Administrative Agent to be distributed by the Administrative Agent as
follows: in the case of a Lease Event of Default, such amounts shall be
distributed in accordance with the Participation Agreement, and in the case of
an Event of Loss, such amounts shall be applied in the Agent Lessor's and the
Administrative Agent's reasonable discretion to the restoration of such Property
or toward the payment of the applicable Property Cost of the affected Property
on the applicable Partial Termination Date in accordance with Section 15.1.

         (b) Participation in Proceedings During Basic Lease Term. The Lessee
may appear in any proceeding or action to negotiate, prosecute, adjust or appeal
any claim for any award, compensation or insurance payment on account of any
Casualty or Condemnation with respect to any Completed Property and shall pay
all expenses thereof. At the Lessee's reasonable request, and at the Lessee's
sole cost and expense, the Certificate Holders and the Lenders shall participate
in any such proceeding, action, negotiation, prosecution or adjustment. The
Certificate Holders and the Lessee agree that this Master Lease shall control
the rights of the Certificate Holders and the Lessee in and to any such award,
compensation or insurance payment.

         (c) Notices of Casualty or Condemnation. If the Agent Certificate
Holder or the Lessee shall receive notice of a Casualty with respect to any
Property for which the reasonable anticipated cost of restoration equals or
exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Property Cost of such Property or of an actual,
pending or threatened Condemnation of any Property or any material interest
therein, the Agent Certificate Holder or the Lessee, as the case may be, shall
give notice thereof to the other and to the Lenders, the Certificate Holders and
the Administrative Agent promptly after the receipt of such notice.

         (d) Repair. (i) If this Master Lease shall continue in full force and
effect following (1) a Casualty or Condemnation affecting any Property during
the Interim Lease Term therefor which arises from the fraud, misapplication of
funds, illegal acts or willful misconduct of the Lessee or (2) a Casualty or
Condemnation affecting any Property which occurs at any time during the Basic
Lease Term thereof, then in each case the Lessee shall, at its sole cost and
expense (utilizing insurance proceeds and condemnation awards as contemplated
hereby and by Sections 3.4(b) and 3.5(b) of the Construction Agency Agreement;
provided, however, that, if any award, compensation or insurance payment is not
sufficient to restore such Property in accordance with this clause (d), the
Lessee shall pay the shortfall), promptly and diligently repair any damage to
such Property caused by such Casualty or Condemnation in conformity with the
requirements of Sections 8.3, 9.1 and 10.1 using the Plans and Specifications
for such Property (as modified to give effect to any subsequent Modifications,
any Condemnation affecting such Property and all Applicable Law) so as to
restore such Property to at least the same or similar condition, operation,
function and value as existed immediately prior to such Casualty or Condemnation
with such Modifications as the Lessee may elect in accordance with Section 10.1.
In such event, title to such Property shall remain with the Lessor Trust subject
to the terms of this Master Lease. Upon completion of such restoration, the


                                       16
<PAGE>

Lessee shall furnish to the Administrative Agent a Responsible Officer's
Certificate confirming that such restoration has been completed pursuant to this
Master Lease.

                (ii) If a Casualty or Condemnation (other than a Casualty or
Condemnation which arises from the fraud, misapplication of funds, illegal acts
or willful misconduct of the Lessee (which Casualty or Condemnation shall be
governed by clause (i) above)) occurs with respect to any Property during the
Interim Lease Term therefor, then, so long as the Agent Certificate Holder shall
not have delivered a Partial Termination Notice with respect thereto, the Lessee
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete construction of such
Property according to the Plans and Specifications therefor as modified to
reflect the effects of such Casualty or Condemnation, but shall not be required
to expend its own funds for such purpose; provided, that if the Administrative
Agent shall have disbursed any funds to the Construction Agent for the repair or
restoration of the applicable Property pursuant to Section 3.4(b) or 3.5(b) of
the Construction Agency Agreement, such funds shall be applied by the Lessee and
Construction Agent solely to the repair or restoration of the applicable
Property in accordance with the Construction Agency Agreement.

         (e) Obligations Continue. In no event shall a Casualty or Condemnation
affect the Lessee's obligations to pay Rent pursuant to Section 3.1 or to
perform its obligations and pay any amounts due on the Expiration Date or
pursuant to Articles XVIII and XX.

         (f) Excess Casualty/Condemnation Proceeds. Any Excess
Casualty/Condemnation Proceeds received by the Certificate Holders or the
Lenders in respect of a Casualty or Condemnation shall be turned over to the
Lessee.

        Section 14.3. Environmental Matters. Promptly upon the Lessee's
obtaining knowledge of the existence of an Environmental Violation with respect
to any Property, the Lessee shall notify the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate
Holder and the Administrative Agent in writing of such Environmental Violation.
If the Agent Certificate Holder elects not to terminate this Master Lease with
respect to the Property pursuant to Section 15.1, at such Lessee's sole cost and
expense, the Lessee shall promptly and diligently commence any response, clean
up, remedial or other action necessary to remove, clean up or remediate the
Environmental Violation in accordance with the terms of Section 8.3; provided
that if Lessee is not a potentially responsible party with respect to such
Environmental Violation or is one of several potentially responsible parties
with respect to such Environmental Violation, and provided that a delay in the
response, clean up, remedial or other action necessary to remove or clean up or
remediate the Environmental Violation will not materially interfere with the
continued productive use and operation or remarketing of the Property, Lessee
may delay such activities during the pendency of any actions that are brought to
determine the parties responsible for such Environmental Violation. The Lessee
shall, upon completion of remedial action by the Lessee, cause to be prepared by
an environmental consultant reasonably acceptable to the Certificate Holders a
report describing the Environmental Violation and the actions taken by the
Lessee (or its agents) in response to such Environmental Violation, and a
statement by the consultant that the Environmental Violation has been remedied
in compliance in all material respects with applicable Environmental Laws. Each
such Environmental Violation shall be remedied prior to the Expiration Date
unless the relevant Property has been purchased by the Lessee in accordance with
Section 18.1 or 18.2. Nothing in this Article XIV shall reduce or limit the


                                       17
<PAGE>

Lessee's obligations under Section 13.1, 13.2 or 13.3 of the Participation
Agreement.

        Section 14.4. Notice of Environmental Matters. Promptly, but in any
event within sixty (60) Business Days from the date the Lessee has actual
knowledge thereof, the Lessee shall provide to the Agent Certificate Holder and
the Administrative Agent written notice of any notice of any pending or
threatened claim, action or proceeding involving any Environmental Laws or any
Release on or in connection with any Property. All such notices shall describe
in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, action or proceeding and the
Lessee's proposed response thereto. In addition, the Lessee shall provide to the
Agent Certificate Holder and the Administrative Agent, within sixty (60)
Business Days of receipt, copies of all written communications with the
Governmental Authority relating to any Environmental Violation in connection
with any Property. The Lessee shall also promptly provide such detailed reports
of any such material environmental claims as may reasonably be requested by any
Participant. In the event that the Lessor Trust or the Agent Certificate Holder
receives written notice of any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding
involving any Environmental Laws or any Release on or in connection with any
Property, the Lessor Trust or, as the case may be, the Agent Certificate Holder
shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lessee.

     Section 16.2. Remedies. Subject to Section 16.5 hereof, upon the occurrence
of any Lease Event of Default and at any time thereafter,  the Agent Certificate
Holder (on  behalf of the  Lessor  Trust)  may,  so long as such Lease  Event of
Default is  continuing,  do one or more of the following  (and in such order) as
the Agent  Certificate  Holder in its sole discretion shall  determine,  without
limiting  any  other  right or  remedy  either  the  Lessor  Trust or the  Agent
Certificate  Holder (on behalf of the Lessor  Trust) may have on account of such
Lease Event of Default  (including,  without  limitation,  the obligation of the
Lessee to purchase all of the Properties as set forth in Section 18.3):

               (a) The Agent Certificate  Holder (on behalf of the Lessor Trust)
          may (i) declare  the entire  outstanding  Lease  Balance to be due and
          payable  together  with  accrued  unpaid  Rent and any  other  amounts
          payable under the Operative Documents, (ii) declare the Commitments to
          be  terminated,  whereupon  the same shall be of no  further  force or

          Section 16.1(i) the Commitments shall automatically terminate,  and/or
          (iii) make demand upon the Lessee and/or the Guarantor;

               (b) The Agent Certificate  Holder (on behalf of the Lessor Trust)

          rescind or  terminate  this Master  Lease as of the date  specified in
          such  notice;  however,  (i)  no  reletting,   reentry  or  taking  of
          possession  of any  Property  (or any  portion  thereof)  by the Agent
          Certificate Holder (or its agents) will be construed as an election on
          either the Lessor  Trust's or the Agent  Certificate  Holder's part to
          terminate  this Master Lease unless a written notice of such intention
          is given to the Lessee, (ii) notwithstanding any reletting, reentry or
          taking of possession,  the Agent Certificate  Holder (on behalf of the
          Lessor  Trust)  may at any time  thereafter  elect to  terminate  this
          Master Lease for a continuing Lease Event of Default, and (iii) no act
          or thing  done by either  the  Lessor  Trust or the Agent  Certificate
          Holder  or any of its  agents,  representatives  or  employees  and no
          agreement  accepting a surrender of the Property shall be valid unless
          the same be made in  writing  and  executed  by the Agent  Certificate
          Holder (on behalf of the Lessor Trust);

               (c) The Agent Certificate  Holder (on behalf of the Lessor Trust)
          may (or may cause the Lessor Trust to) (i) demand that the Lessee, and
          the Lessee  shall  upon the  written  demand of the Agent  Certificate
          Holder,  return all of the Properties  promptly to the Lessor Trust in


                                       24
<PAGE>

          the manner and condition required by, and otherwise in accordance with
          all of the provisions  of,  Articles VII and IX and Section 8.3 hereof
          as if the Properties were being returned at the end of the Lease Term,
          and neither the Lessor Trust, nor the Agent Certificate Holder nor any
          Certificate Holder shall be liable for the reimbursement of the Lessee
          for any costs  and  expenses  incurred  by the  Lessee  in  connection
          therewith,  and (ii)  without  prejudice to any other remedy which the
          Certificate Holders may have for possession of the Properties,  and to
          the extent and in the manner  permitted by Applicable  Law, enter upon
          the Property and take immediate possession of (to the exclusion of the
          Lessee)  the  Properties  or any part  thereof and expel or remove the
          Lessee and any other  Person who may be  occupying  any  Property,  by
          summary proceedings or otherwise,  all without liability to either the
          Lessor Trust or the Agent Certificate  Holder for or by reason of such
          entry or taking of possession,  whether for the  restoration of damage
          to property caused by such taking or otherwise and, in addition to the
          other  damages  of  the  Certificate  Holders,  the  Lessee  shall  be
          responsible  for all costs and expenses  incurred by the Lessor Trust,
          the  Agent  Certificate   Holder,   the   Administrative   Agent,  the
          Certificate   Holders  and/or  the  Lenders  in  connection  with  any
          reletting, including, without limitation, reasonable brokers' fees and
          all costs of any alterations or repairs made by any such party;

               (d) As more  fully set forth in  Section  16.4  hereof and in the
          Lease  Supplement  (and  consistent  with the intent of the parties as
          detailed  in Article XXV  hereof),  the Agent  Certificate  Holder (on
          behalf  of the  Lessor  Trust)  may (or may  cause  Lessor  Trust  to)
          exercise all remedies  available to a beneficiary or trustee under law
          or equity,  including,  to the extent  permitted  by law, the right to
          sell all or any part of the  Properties  at public or private sale, as
          the Agent  Certificate  Holder may determine.  In connection  with any
          sale or sales  hereunder,  Lessor  Trust may elect to treat any of the
          Properties  which  consists  of a right in action or which is property
          that can be  severed  from the real  property  covered  hereby  or any
          improvements  thereon without causing  structural damage thereto as if
          the same were personal property, and dispose of the same in accordance
          with  applicable  law,  separate  and  apart  from  the  sale  of real
          property.  Any  sale  of any  personal  property  hereunder  shall  be
          conducted  in any  manner  permitted  by  Section  9501  or any  other
          applicable  section  of the  California  Commercial  Code.  Where  the
          Property consists of real and personal property or fixtures whether or




                                       25
<PAGE>

          not such personal  property is located on or within the real property,
          Lessor  Trust may elect in its  discretion  to exercise its rights and
          remedies against any or all of the real property,  personal  property,
          and fixtures in such order and manner as is now or hereafter permitted
          by applicable law.  Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,
          Lessor  Trust may,  in its sole and  absolute  discretion  and without
          regard to the adequacy of its security,  elect to proceed  against any
          or all of the real  property,  personal  property  and fixtures in any
          manner permitted under Section 9501(4)(a) of the California Commercial
          Code;  and if Lessor Trust  elects to proceed in the manner  permitted
          under Section  9501(4)(a)(ii)  of the California  Commercial Code, the
          power of sale herein granted shall be exercisable  with respect to all
          or any of the real property,  personal  property and fixtures  covered
          hereby,  as  designated  by Lessor  Trust,  and the  Trustee is hereby
          authorized  and  empowered  to  conduct  any  such  sale  of any  real
          property,  personal  property  and  fixtures  in  accordance  with the
          procedures applicable to real property. Where the Property consists of
          real  property  and  personal  property,   any  reinstatement  of  the
          obligation secured hereby, following default and an election by Lessor
          Trust to accelerate the maturity of said obligation,  which is made by
          Lessee or any other  person or entity  permitted to exercise the right
          of  reinstatement  under Section 2924c of the California Civil Code or
          any  successor  statute,  shall not, in  accordance  with the terms of
          California  Commercial Code Section  9501(4)(c)(iii),  prohibit Lessor
          Trust from  conducting  a sale or other  disposition  of any  personal
          property  or  fixtures  or  from  otherwise   proceeding   against  or
          continuing to proceed against any personal property or fixtures in any
          manner permitted by the California Commercial Code; nor shall any such
          reinstatement  invalidate,  rescind  or  otherwise  affect  any  sale,
          disposition or other  proceedings  held,  conducted or instituted with
          respect  to  any   personal   property  or  fixtures   prior  to  such
          reinstatement or pending at the time of such  reinstatement.  Any sums
          paid to  Lessor  Trust in  effecting  any  reinstatement  pursuant  to
          Section  2924c of the  California  Civil  Code shall be applied to the
          secured  obligation  and to Lessor  Trust's and  Trustee's  reasonable
          costs and  expenses in the manner  required by Section  2924c.  Should
          Lessor Trust elect to sell any portion of the  Property  which is real
          property or which is personal  property or fixtures  that Lessor Trust
          has elected under Section  9501(4)(a)(ii) of the California Commercial
          Code to sell together  with real property in accordance  with the laws
          governing a sale of real property,  Lessor Trust or Trustee shall give
          such notice of default and election to sell as may then be required by
          law. Any requirement of the California  Commercial Code for reasonable
          notification  shall be met by mailing  written notice to Lessee at its
          address  above set  forth at least 10 days  prior to the sale or other
          event for which such notice is required;

                   (e) The Agent Certificate Holder (on behalf of the Lessor
         Trust) may (or may cause Lessor Trust to), at its option, elect not to
         terminate this Master Lease and continue to collect all Basic Rent,
         Supplemental Rent, and all other amounts due to the Lessor Trust
         (together with all costs of collection) and enforce the Lessee's
         obligations under this Master Lease as and when the same become due, or
         are to be performed, and at the option of the Agent Certificate Holder
         (on behalf of the Lessor Trust), upon any abandonment of the Property
         by the Lessee or re-entry of same by the Agent Certificate Holder (on
         behalf of the Lessor Trust) or the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate
         Holder (on behalf of the Lessor Trust) or the Lessor Trust may, in its
         sole and absolute discretion, elect not to terminate this Master Lease
         and may make the necessary repairs in order to relet the Property, and
         relet the Property or any part thereof for such term or terms (which
         may be for a long term extending beyond the Lease Term of this Master
         Lease) and at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and
         conditions as the Agent Certificate Holder in its reasonable discretion
         may deem advisable; and upon each such reletting, all rentals actually
         received by the Agent Certificate Holder from such reletting shall be
         applied to the Lessee's obligations hereunder and the other Operative
         Documents in the manner provided in Section 7.6(a) or (c), as
         applicable, of the Participation Agreement. If such rentals received
         from such reletting during any period are less than the Rent to be paid
         during that period by the Lessee hereunder, the Lessee shall pay any
         deficiency, as calculated by the Agent Certificate Holder, to the
         Administrative Agent on the next Scheduled Payment Date;


                                       26
<PAGE>

               (f) Unless all of the Property has been sold in its entirety, the
          Agent  Certificate  Holder (on behalf of the Lessor Trust) may (or may
          cause Lessor Trust to), whether or not the Agent Certificate Holder or
          the Lessor Trust shall have exercised or shall  thereafter at any time
          exercise  any of its  rights  under  clause  (c),  (d) or (e) of  this
          Section  16.2 with  respect  to all of the  Property  or any  portions
          thereof, demand, by written notice to the Lessee specifying a date not
          earlier than twenty (20) days after the date of such notice,  that the
          Lessee  purchase,  on the date  specified in such  notice,  all of the
          Property in accordance  with the provisions of Article XXI and Section
          18.2;

               (g) The Agent Certificate  Holder (on behalf of the Lessor Trust)
          may (or may cause  Lessor Trust to) exercise any other right or remedy
          that may be  available  to it under  Applicable  Law,  or  proceed  by
          appropriate  court action  (legal or  equitable)  to enforce the terms
          hereof or to recover damages for the breach hereof. Separate suits may
          be brought to collect  any such  damages for any  period(s),  and such
          suits shall not in any manner prejudice the Agent Certificate Holder's
          or  Lessor  Trust's  rights  to  collect  any  such  damages  for  any
          subsequent  period(s),  or the Agent Certificate  Holder may defer any
          such suit until after the expiration of the Lease Term, in which event
          such suit shall be deemed not to have accrued until the  expiration of
          the Lease Term;

               (h) The Agent  Certificate  Holder  (or,  as the case may be, the
          Lessor Trust at the Agent Certificate  Holder's  direction) may retain
          and  apply  against  the  Lease  Balance  all  sums  which  the  Agent
          Certificate  Holder (or, as the case may be, the Lessor  Trust) would,
          absent  such Lease  Event of  Default,  be required to pay to, or turn
          over to, the Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Master Lease; or

               (i) The Agent  Certificate  Holder  (or,  as the case may be, the
          Lessor  Trust at the Agent  Certificate  Holder's  direction),  to the
          extent  permitted  by  Applicable  Law,  as a matter of right and with
          notice  to the  Lessee,  shall  have the  right to apply to any  court
          having  jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers of any part of
          the Property,  and the Lessee hereby irrevocably  consents to any such
          appointment. Any such receivers shall have all of the usual powers and
          duties of receivers in like or similar cases and all of the powers and
          duties of the Agent  Certificate  Holder  (or, as the case may be, the
          Lessor  Trust)  in case of  entry,  and  shall  continue  as such  and
          exercise such powers until the date of confirmation of the sale of the
          Property unless such receivership is sooner terminated.

         The Agent Certificate Holder (or, as the case may be, the Lessor Trust
at the Agent Certificate Holder's direction) shall be entitled (or may cause the
Lessor Trust) to enforce payment of the indebtedness and performance of the
obligations secured hereby and to exercise all rights and powers under this
instrument or under any of the other Operative Documents or other agreement or
any laws now or hereafter in force, notwithstanding some or all of the
obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise secured, whether by
mortgage, security agreement, pledge, lien, assignment or otherwise. Neither the
acceptance of this instrument nor its enforcement shall prejudice or in any
manner affect the Agent Certificate Holder's (or, as the case may be, the Lessor
Trust's) right to realize upon or enforce any other security now or hereafter
held by the Agent Certificate Holder (or may cause the Lessor Trust), it being
agreed that the Agent Certificate Holder shall be entitled to enforce this

                                       27
<PAGE>

instrument and any other security now or hereafter held by the Agent Certificate
Holder in such order and manner as the Certificate Holder may determine in its
absolute discretion. No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Agent
Certificate Holder (or, as the case may be, the Lessor Trust) is intended to be
exclusive of any other remedy herein or by law provided or permitted, but each
shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Every
power or remedy given by any of the Operative Documents to the Agent Certificate
Holder (or, as the case may be, the Lessor Trust) or to which it may otherwise
be entitled, may be exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time
and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Agent Certificate Holder. In no
event shall the Agent Certificate Holder (or, as the case may be, the Lessor
Trust), in the exercise of the remedies provided in this instrument (including,
without limitation, in connection with the assignment of rents to Lessor Trust,
or the appointment of a receiver and the entry of such receiver onto all or any
part of the Properties), be deemed a "mortgagee in possession," and neither the
Agent Certificate Holder nor the Lessor Trust shall in any way be made liable
for any act, either of commission or omission, in connection with the exercise
of such remedies.

         If, pursuant to the exercise by the Agent Certificate Holder (or, as
the case may be, the Lessor Trust) of its remedies pursuant to this Section
16.2, the Lease Balance and all other amounts due and owing from the Lessee
under this Master Lease and the other Operative Documents have been paid in
full, then the Agent Certificate Holder (or, as the case may be, the Lessor
Trust) shall remit to the Lessee any excess amounts received by the Agent
Certificate Holder (or, as the case may be, the Lessor Trust).

         If requested by the Agent Certificate Holder in connection with the
exercise of its remedies pursuant to this Section 16.2, the Lessee hereby agrees
to enter into an operating agreement and in connection therewith to serve as the
operator of the Properties; such agreement to be on market terms established in
good faith and reasonably acceptable to the Agent Certificate Holder.

        Section 16.3. Waiver of Certain Rights. (a) To the maximum extent
permitted by law, the Lessee hereby waives the benefit of any appraisement,
valuation, stay, extension, reinstatement and redemption laws now or hereafter
in force and all rights of marshalling in the event of any sale of the Property
or any interest therein, (b) if this Master Lease shall be terminated pursuant
to Section 16.2, the Lessee waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i)
any notice of re-entry or the institution of legal proceedings to obtain
re-entry or possession; (ii) any right of redemption, re-entry or repossession;
(iii) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force exempting property from
liability for rent or for debt or limiting the Agent Certificate Holder (or, as
the case may be, the Lessor Trust) with respect to the election of remedies; and
(iv) any other rights which might otherwise limit or modify any of the Agent
Certificate Holder's (or, as the case may be, the Lessor Trust's) rights or
remedies under this Article XVI.

        Section 16.4. Deed of Trust Remedies. Without limiting any other
remedies set forth in this Master Lease, and also, without limiting the
generality of Article XXV hereof, the Trustee (for the benefit and at the
direction of the Lessor Trust) Agent Certificate Holder (or, as the case may be,
the Lessor Trust at the Agent Certificate Holder's direction) may proceed by a
suit or suits in equity or at law, whether for a foreclosure hereunder, or (to
the extent permitted by law) for the sale of the Property, pursuant to a power


                                       28
<PAGE>

of sale, or against the Lessee on a recourse basis for the Lease Balance, or for
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid
of the execution of any power granted herein, or for the appointment of a
receiver pending any foreclosure hereunder or the sale of the Property, or for
the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy. The Trustee
and Lessor Trust shall have all rights available to a trustee or beneficiary
under the laws of the state where the relevant Property is located, including,
without limitation, all rights granted a trustee or beneficiary under the laws
of the State of California, including, without limitation, all rights granted a
trustee or beneficiary under Sections 725a and 726 of the California Code of
Civil Procedure (each such statute, as amended, is hereinafter referred to as a
"Deed of Trust Laws"). In the event that any provisions of this Master Lease
shall be inconsistent with any Deed of Trust Laws, the provisions of such Deed
of Trust Laws shall take precedence over such provision of this Master Lease,
but shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other provision of this
Master Lease that can be construed in a manner consistent with such Deed of
Trust Laws. If any provision of this Master Lease shall grant the Trustee or the
Lessor Trust any rights or remedies upon default of the Lessee which are more
limited than the rights that would otherwise be vested in the Lessor Trust under
such Deed of Trust Laws in the absence of such provision, the Trustee and Lessor
Trust shall be vested with the rights granted in such Deed of Trust Laws to the
full extent permitted by law. Lessee agrees that the agreements of Lessee herein
contained shall be specifically enforceable by injunction or any other
appropriate equitable remedy and that for the purpose of any suit brought under
this subparagraph, Lessee hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the defense of laches and any applicable statute of limitations. In the event of
foreclosure, Lessee authorizes and empowers Trustee or Lessor Trust to effect
insurance upon the Property in amounts aforesaid for a period covering the time
of redemption from foreclosure sale provided by law, and if necessary therefor,
to cancel any or all existing insurance policies.

        Section 16.5. Limitation on Recourse With Respect to Uncompleted
Properties and in Connection with Limited Recourse Defaults. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in this Master Lease or any other Operative
Document, with respect to Uncompleted Properties and with respect to Limited
Recourse Defaults the maximum amount payable by the Lessee on a recourse basis
(excluding any amounts which the Administrative Agent or Agent Certificate
Holder may receive upon a sale or reletting of the Properties) under this
Article XVI and Section 18.3 shall be limited as follows: (a) amounts payable
with respect to each Uncompleted Property shall be limited as set forth in
Section 5.4 of the Construction Agency Agreement and (b) amounts payable with
respect to each Completed Property as the result of a Limited Recourse Default
shall be limited to the aggregate Maximum Recourse Amounts for such Completed
Property plus the aggregate amount of Certificate Holder Amounts that are
allocable to Qualified Land constituting part of such Completed Property plus
all accrued and unpaid Rent (including Supplemental Rent, if any) which has
accrued prior to or as of the date of payment by Lessee; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise affect any payments or amounts
payable by the Lessee with respect to any indemnity under any Operative Document
or with respect to any damages incurred by any Agent or any Participant as a
result of the Lessee's failure to return the applicable Property or Properties
as required under this Section 16.4 and Section 16.5. In connection with any
Construction Return or upon the occurrence of any Limited Recourse Default, the
Lessee shall convey to the Agent Lessor all of its interest in (x) in the case


                                       29
<PAGE>

of a Construction Return, the applicable Uncompleted Property or Uncompleted
Properties or (y) in the case of a Limited Recourse Default, all of the
Completed Properties, in each case on the date specified by the Agent Lessor
(such date, the "Return Date") in compliance with the provisions of Section
16.6.

        Section 16.6. Conveyance Upon Construction Return or Limited Recourse
Default. If the Lessee is required to return an Uncompleted Property pursuant to
Section 5.3(b)(ii) of the Construction Agency Agreement or if a Limited Recourse
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee shall, in addition to
making the payments required pursuant to Section 5.4 of the Construction Agency
Agreement (in the case of a Construction Return) or pursuant to Section 16.4
hereof (in the case of a conveyance in connection with a Limited Recourse
Default), do each of the following:

               (a) on or prior to the Return  Date,  execute  and deliver to the
          Agent  Certificate  Holder  (or  to  the  Agent  Certificate  Holder's
          designee)  (A) grant deeds with  respect to its interest in all of the
          applicable Properties,  (B) bills of sale with respect to its interest
          in all  personalty  and Equipment (if any) included in the  applicable
          Properties  and (C) an assignment of the Lessee's  entire  interest in
          all of the applicable Properties (which shall include an assignment of
          all of the  Lessee's  right,  title and interest in and to all awards,
          compensation  and insurance  proceeds  payable in connection  with any
          Casualty or  Condemnation  affecting the applicable  Properties and an
          assignment of leases of the  applicable  Properties),  in each case in
          recordable form and otherwise in conformity with local custom and free
          and clear of any Liens attributable to the Lessee excluding  Permitted
          Property Liens  referenced in clauses (i), (vii),  (ix) and (x) of the
          definition thereof;

               (b) execute and deliver to the Agent  Certificate  Holder and the
          other  Certificate  Holders a statement of  termination of this Master
          Lease to the extent relating to the applicable Properties; and

               (c)  on  the  Return  Date,  transfer  possession  of  all of the
          Properties to the independent  purchaser(s) thereof, or, if all of the
          Properties  have not been sold on or prior to the Return Date,  to the
          Certificate  Holders or any Person designated by the Agent Certificate
          Holder,   by  surrendering  the  same  into  the  possession  of  such
          independent purchaser(s), the Agent Certificate Holder or such Person,
          as the case may be.


                                  ARTICLE XVII


                    AGENT CERTIFICATE HOLDER'S RIGHT TO CURE

        Section 17.1. The Agent Certificate Holder's Right to Cure the Lessee's
Lease Defaults. The Agent Certificate Holder, without waiving or releasing any
obligation or Lease Event of Default, may (but shall be under no obligation to)
remedy any Lease Event of Default for the account and at the sole cost and
expense of the Lessee, including the failure by the Lessee to maintain the
insurance required by Article XIII, and may, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, and notwithstanding any right of quiet enjoyment in favor of the Lessee,
enter upon any Property for such purpose and take all such action thereon as may


                                       30
<PAGE>

be necessary or appropriate therefor. No such entry shall be deemed an eviction
of the Lessee. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses so incurred
(including fees and expenses of counsel), together with interest thereon at the
Overdue Rate from the date on which such sums or expenses are paid by the Agent
Certificate Holder, shall be paid by the Lessee to the Agent Certificate Holder
as Supplemental Rent.


                                  ARTICLE XVIII


                               PURCHASE PROVISIONS

        Section 18.1. Purchase of the Property. Subject to the conditions
contained herein, and without limitation of the Lessee's purchase obligation
pursuant to Section 18.2 or 18.3, the Lessee shall have the irrevocable option
on any Business Day to purchase any or all of the Properties subject to this
Master Lease (the "Purchase Option") at a price equal to the aggregate Property
Balances of the relevant Properties on the date of such purchase (the "Purchase
Option Price"). The Lessee's exercise of its option pursuant to this Section
18.1 shall be subject to the following conditions:

               (i) the Lessee  shall  have  delivered  a Purchase  Notice to the
          Agent Certificate  Holder and the  Administrative  Agent not less than
          thirty (30) days prior to such  purchase,  specifying the date of such
          purchase;

               (ii) the Lessee shall not have delivered (or, if delivered, shall
          not have failed to rescind) a written notice of the Lessee's  exercise
          of the Remarketing Option pursuant to Section 20.1(a);

               (iii) if the  purchase is of less then all  Properties,  no Lease
          Event of Default shall have occurred and then be continuing; and

               (iv) the lessee may not exercise its Purchase Option with respect
          to any Property  unless the Lessee  purchases all of the Properties or
          the Required Participants shall have consented to the exercise of such
          purchase Option with respect to less than all of the Properties, which
          consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         If the Lessee exercises its option pursuant to this Section 18.1 then,
upon the Administrative Agent's receipt of all amounts due in connection
therewith, the Agent Certificate Holder shall cause Lessor Trust to transfer to
the Lessee or its designees all of the Lessor Trust's right, title and interest
in and to the Property in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
21.1(a), such transfer to be effective as of the date specified in the Purchase
Notice. The Lessee may designate, in a notice given to the Agent Certificate
Holder and the Administrative Agent not less than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the closing of such purchase (time being of the essence), the transferee or
transferees to whom the conveyance shall be made (if other than to the Lessee),


                                       31
<PAGE>

in which case such conveyance shall (subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein) be made to such designee; provided, however, that such designation
of a transferee or transferees shall not cause the Guarantor or the Lessee to be
released, fully or partially, from any of their obligations under this Master
Lease, including, without limitation, the obligation to pay to the Agent
Certificate Holder the Lease Balance on the date specified in the Purchase
Notice.

        Section 18.2. Expiration Date Purchase Obligation. Unless (a) the Lessee
shall have properly exercised its option pursuant to Section 18.1 and purchased
all of the Properties pursuant thereto, or (b) the Lessee shall have properly
exercised the Remarketing Option and shall have fulfilled all of the
requirements of Article XX and the Lessor Trust shall have sold its interests in
all of the Properties pursuant thereto, then, subject to the terms, conditions
and provisions set forth in this Article, and in accordance with the terms of
Section 21.1(a), the Lessee (or its designee) shall purchase from the Lessor
Trust, and the Lessor Trust shall convey to the Lessee (or its designee), on the
Expiration Date all of the interest of the Lessor Trust in all of the Properties
for an amount equal to the Lease Balance. The Lessee may designate, in a notice
given to the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder and the Administrative
Agent not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the closing of such purchase
(time being of the essence), the transferee or transferees to whom the
conveyance shall be made (if other than to the Lessee), in which case such
conveyance shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein) be made
to such designee; provided, however, that such designation of a transferee or
transferees shall not cause the Lessee to be released, fully or partially, from
any of its obligations under this Master Lease, including, without limitation,
the obligation to pay the Agent Certificate Holder (on behalf of the Lessor
Trust) the Lease Balance on such Expiration Date.

        Section 18.3. Acceleration of Purchase Obligation The Lessee shall be
obligated to purchase for an amount equal to the Lease Balance all of the
interest of the Lessor Trust in all of the Properties (notwithstanding any prior
election to exercise its Purchase Option pursuant to Section 18.1) automatically
and without notice upon the occurrence of any Lease Event of Default described
in clause (i) of Section 16.1. Any purchase under this Section 18.3 shall be in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 21.1(a).


                                   ARTICLE XIX


                          EXTENSION OF EXPIRATION DATE

     Section  19.1.  Extension  of  Expiration  Date.  The Lessee may extend the
Expiration Date subject to, and in accordance  with, the terms and conditions of
Section 11.1 of the Participation Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE XX


                               REMARKETING OPTION

     Section 20.1. Option to Remarket. Subject to the fulfillment of each of the
conditions  set forth in this Section 20.1 and Section 20.2  (collectively,  the
"Return  Conditions"),  the  Lessee  shall  have the  option  (the  "Remarketing
Option") to remarket  and  complete  the sale of all of the  Properties  for the
Lessor Trust.


                                       32
<PAGE>

         The Lessee's effective exercise and consummation of the Remarketing
Option shall be subject to the due and timely fulfillment of each of the
following provisions and the provisions of Section 20.2 as to each of the
Properties as of the dates set forth below.

     (a) Unless a longer  period is called for  pursuant to any  Requirement  of
Law, on the date not later than three hundred sixty-five (365) days prior to the
Expiration Date, the Lessee shall give to the Agent  Certificate  Holder and the
Administrative  Agent written notice of the Lessee's exercise of the Remarketing
Option.

     (b) Not  later  than  one  hundred  and  twenty  (120)  days  prior  to the
Expiration  Date,  the Lessee shall deliver to the Agent  Certificate  Holder an
Environmental  Audit  for  each  Property.  Such  Environmental  Audit  shall be
prepared by an environmental consultant selected by the Agent Certificate Holder
in the Agent  Certificate  Holder's  discretion  and shall  contain  conclusions
satisfactory to the Agent Certificate  Holder as to the environmental  status of
each Property.  If any such Environmental Audit indicates any exceptions calling
for a Phase Two environmental  assessment,  the Lessee shall have also delivered
prior  to the  Expiration  Date a Phase  Two  environmental  assessment  by such
environmental   consultant  and  a  written  statement  by  such   environmental
consultant  indicating that all such exceptions have been remedied in compliance
with Applicable Law.

     (c) On the date of the Lessee's notice to the Agent  Certificate  Holder of
the Lessee's  exercise of the Remarketing  Option,  no Lease Event of Default or
Lease Default shall exist, and,  thereafter,  no Lease Event of Default or Lease
Default shall occur.

     (d) The  Completion  Date shall have occurred with respect to each Property
prior to the  Lessee's  delivery  of notice of its  intention  to  exercise  the
Remarketing Option, and each parcel of Land subject to any ground lease shall be
a separate tax lot.

     (e) The  Lessee  shall  have  substantially  completed  all  Modifications,
restoration and rebuilding of the relevant  Properties pursuant to Sections 10.1
and 14.1 (as the case may be) and shall have fulfilled all of the conditions and
requirements  in connection  therewith  pursuant to such Sections,  in each case
prior to the date on which the Agent  Certificate  Holder  receives the Lessee's
notice of the Lessee's  intention to exercise the Remarketing Option (time being
of the  essence),  regardless  of whether the same shall be within the  Lessee's
control.  Lessee  shall have also paid the cost of all  Modifications  commenced
prior to the  Expiration  Date.  Lessee shall not have been excused  pursuant to
Section 12.1 from  complying with any Applicable Law that involved the extension
of the ultimate  imposition of such  Applicable Law beyond the Expiration  Date.
Any Permitted Property Liens (other than Lessor Liens) on any Property that were
contested  by Lessee shall have been  removed and the Agent  Certificate  Holder
shall have  received  evidence  satisfactory  to it that all Liens  (other  than
Lessor Liens and uncontested  Permitted  Property Liens of the type described in
clauses (i), (vii), (ix) and (x) of the definition thereof) have been removed.

        Section 20.2. Procedures During Remarketing. (a) During the Marketing
Period, the Lessee shall, as nonexclusive agent for the Lessor Trust, use its
best efforts to sell the interest of the Lessor Trust in the Properties and will
attempt to obtain the highest purchase price therefor and for not less than the


                                       33
<PAGE>

Fair Market Sales Value. The Lessee will be responsible for hiring brokers and
making the Property available for inspection by prospective purchasers. Lessee
shall promptly upon request permit inspection of the Property and any
maintenance records relating to any Property by the Agent Certificate Holder,
any Participant and any potential purchasers, and the Lessee shall otherwise do
all things necessary to sell and deliver possession of the Properties to any
purchaser. All such marketing of the Properties shall be at the Lessee's sole
expense.

     (b) The Lessee shall use best  efforts to procure  written bids from one or
more bona fide prospective purchasers.  No such purchaser shall be the Guarantor
or any Affiliate thereof.  The written offer must specify the Expiration Date as
the closing date. The Agent Certificate Holder and each Certificate Holder shall
have the right, but shall be under no duty, to solicit bids, to inquire into the
efforts of the Lessee to obtain bids or otherwise  to take action in  connection
with any such sale.

     (c) The  Lessee  shall  submit  all bids to the  Agent  Certificate  Holder
promptly upon receipt,  and the Agent  Certificate  Holder and each  Certificate
Holder  will  have the  right to submit  any one or more  bids.  Any sale by the
Lessee  shall be for the highest  cash bid  submitted  to the Agent  Certificate
Holder.  The  determination  of the  highest  bid  shall  be made  by the  Agent
Certificate  Holder prior to the end of the Marketing Period,  but in any event,
the Agent Certificate Holder shall have no obligation to approve any bid for any
Property  unless each highest bid for a Property  equals or exceeds the Property
Cost for such Property plus all Permitted Sales Costs  therefor.  All bids shall
be on an all-cash basis.

     (d) In  connection  with any such sale of any  Property,  the  Lessee  will
provide  to the  purchaser  all  customary  "seller's"  indemnities  (including,
without  limitation,  an  environmental  indemnity  to the  extent  the same are
required by the purchaser) and representations  and warranties  regarding title,
absence of Liens (except Lessor Liens) and the condition of such  Property.  The
Lessee shall have obtained,  at its cost and expense, all required  governmental
and  regulatory  consents  and  approvals  and shall  have made all  filings  as
required by  Applicable  Law in order to carry out and  complete the transfer of
each of the Properties.  As to the Agent Certificate  Holder,  the Lessor Trust,
and the Certificate  Holders, any such sale shall be made on an "as is, with all
faults" basis without  representation or warranty by the Lessor Trust, the Agent
Certificate  Holder or any other  Certificate  Holder  other than the absence of
Lessor Liens  attributable to the Lessor Trust or such Certificate  Holder.  Any
agreement as to such sale shall be made subject to the rights of the Certificate
Holders hereunder.

     (e) The Lessee  shall pay  directly,  and not from the sale  proceeds,  all
prorations,  credits, costs and expenses of the sale of the Properties,  whether
incurred  by  the  Certificate  Holders  or  the  Lessee,   including,   without
limitation,  the cost of all title insurance,  surveys,  environmental  reports,
appraisals,  transfer taxes, the reasonable attorneys' fees of the Lessor Trust,
the Agent Certificate Holder, the Certificate  Holders,  the Lessee's attorneys'
fees,  commissions,  escrow fees, recording fees, and all applicable documentary
and other transfer taxes; provided, however, that upon consummation of the sales
(if any) of the Properties during the Marketing Period and the Agent Certificate
Holder's  receipt of the Gross  Remarketing  Proceeds and all other  amounts due
under this Master  Lease and the other  Operative  Documents,  the Lessor  Agent
shall apply such Gross Remarketing Proceeds,  first, to payment of the Permitted
Sales Costs in accordance with Section 20.1(h).


                                       34
<PAGE>

     (f)  Lessee  shall  pay to the  Administrative  Agent  on or  prior  to the
Expiration  Date (or in the case of  Supplemental  Rent, to the Person  entitled
thereto) an amount equal to the Maximum  Recourse  Amount for such Property plus
the aggregate amount of Loans and Certificate  Holder Amounts that are allocable
to Qualified Land plus all accrued and unpaid Rent (including Supplemental Rent,
if any) and all other amounts  hereunder which have accrued or will accrue prior
to or as of the Expiration  Date, in the type of funds  specified in Section 3.4
hereof.

     (g)  Lessee  shall  pay to the  Administrative  Agent  on or  prior  to the
Expiration  Date the amounts,  if any,  required to be paid  pursuant to Section
13.2 of the Participation Agreement.

     (h) The sale of the Properties  shall be consummated on the Expiration Date
and the gross  proceeds  (the "Gross  Remarketing  Proceeds") of the sale of the
Properties  (less  any  marketing,   closing  or  other  costs,   prorations  or
commissions incurred by the Certificate Holders or the Agent Certificate Holder)
shall  be paid  directly  to the  Administrative  Agent.  If any  such  sales of
Properties  are  consummated  during  the  Marketing  Period,   then,  upon  the
Administrative  Agent's timely receipt of the Gross Remarketing Proceeds thereof
and all other  amounts  due to the  Administrative  Agent and Agent  Certificate
Holder and the  Participants  under this  Master  Lease and the other  Operative
Documents  (including  all amounts due  pursuant to clause (f) above and Article
XIII of the Participation Agreement),  the Administrative Agent shall apply such
Gross  Remarketing  Proceeds,  first,  to the payment of Permitted  Sales Costs,
second to the payment of the Loans in excess of the Maximum  Recourse Amount and
third to the Agent Certificate Holder for payment to the Certificate Holders. On
an individual Property basis, if, the Gross Remarketing  Proceeds from such sale
(if any) of a Property exceeds the sum of (i) the aggregate Property Balance for
such Property being sold as of such date minus the Maximum Recourse Amount, Loan
and  Qualified  Land  amounts and other  amounts  paid to  Administrative  Agent
pursuant to clause (f) above for such  Property  plus (ii) all  Permitted  Sales
Costs with respect to such Property, then the excess shall be paid to the Lessee
on the Expiration Date.

     (i) Except as expressly set forth  herein,  the Lessee shall have no right,
power or  authority to bind the Lessor Trust or any  Participant  in  connection
with any proposed sale of any Property.

     (j) During the Marketing  Period,  the obligation of the Lessee to pay Rent
(including the  installment  of Rent due on the Expiration  Date) shall continue
undiminished  until  payment in full of the Lease  Balance and all other amounts
due to the  Participants  under the  Operative  Documents  to which  Lessee is a
party.

     Section 20.3.  Remedies for Failed  Remarketing.  If the Lessee effectively
elects the  Remarketing  Option and each of the conditions and  requirements  in
Sections 20.1 and 20.2 shall have been satisfied, but nevertheless the Lessee is
unable to obtain bids satisfactory to the Certificate  Holders,  and the sale of
the Properties is not consummated prior to the end of the Marketing Period,  the


                                       35
<PAGE>

Agent  Certificate  Holder shall by written  notice to the Lessee  choose one or
both of the following remedies (which election may be changed at any time):

               (a)  Continue  Remarketing  Efforts.  At the request of the Agent
          Certificate Holder, the Lessee shall continue to market the Properties
          on behalf of the Lessor Trust for up to an  additional  six (6) months
          and at the sole cost and expense of Lessee,  and during such  extended
          marketing  period continue to comply with the requirements of Articles
          IX, X, XI, XIII,  XIV and XX at Lessee's  sole cost and  expense.  The
          Agent  Certificate  Holder  shall  by  written  notice  to the  Lessee
          indicate the duration of such extended  marketing period (the last day

and 20.2 shall have been satisfied, but nevertheless the Lessee is unable to
obtain a bid at least equal to the Certificate Holder Balance during the

Property is not sold (due either to the Agent Certificate Holder's rejection of
any bids or the failure to obtain any bids), there shall not be deemed to be a
Lease Event of Default by virtue of such failure to sell the Properties and the
Lessee shall only be obligated to make the payments referred to in Sections
20.2(e), (f) and (g) hereof.

                                   ARTICLE XXV


                              INTENT OF THE PARTIES

     Section 25.1. Ownership of the Property. (a) The parties hereto intend that
(i) for financial  accounting  purposes  with respect to the Lessee,  the Lessor
Trust will be treated as the owner and lessor of an  undivided  interest in each
Property and the Lessee will be treated as the lessee of the Property  leased by
it hereunder  and (ii) for federal and all state and local income tax  purposes,
state real estate and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (A) the Lease will
be treated as a  financing  arrangement,  (B) the  Certificate  Holders  and the
Lenders will be deemed  lenders making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to
the sum of the Certificate  Holder Amounts and the outstanding  principal amount
of the Loans, which loans are secured by the Property and (C) the Lessee will be
treated as the owner of each  Property  and will be entitled to all tax benefits
ordinarily  available to an owner of properties  like each Property for such tax
purposes.  Nevertheless,  the Lessee  acknowledges  and agrees  that none of the
Administrative  Agent,  the  Agent  Certificate  Holder,  the  Arranger  or  any
Participant has made any representations or warranties to the Lessee concerning


                                       39
<PAGE>

the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents and that
the Lessee has obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting and legal advice
concerning the Operative Documents as it deems appropriate. The parties hereto
will not take any position inconsistent with the intentions expressed herein.
<PAGE>

     (b) It is the  intent  of the  parties  hereto  that  this  Lease  grants a
security  interest  and  mortgage,  as the case may be, on each  Property to the
Lessor  Trust for the  benefit of the Agent  Certificate  Holder,  and the other
Participants  to secure the  performance  of the Lessee under and payment of all
amounts  under  the  Lease  and  the  other  Operative  Documents  all  as  more
specifically set forth in Section 5 of each Lease Supplement.


                                  ARTICLE XXVI


                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 26.1. Severability;  Perpetuities; Etc. If any term or provision of
this  Master  Lease or any  application  thereof  shall be  declared  invalid or
unenforceable,  the remainder of this Master Lease and any other  application of
such term or provision shall not be affected thereby.  If any right or option of
the  Lessee  provided  in this  Master  Lease,  including  any  right or  option
described  in  Article  XIV,  XV,  XVIII or XX,  would,  in the  absence  of the
limitation  imposed by this sentence,  be invalid or  unenforceable  as being in
violation of the rule against  perpetuities or any other rule of law relating to
the vesting of an interest in or the  suspension  of the power of  alienation of
property,  then such right or option shall be exercisable only during the period
which  shall  end  twenty-one  (21)  years  after  the date of death of the last
survivor of the  descendants of Franklin D. Roosevelt,  the former  President of
the United States, Henry Ford, the deceased automobile manufacturer, and John D.
Rockefeller,  the founder of the Standard Oil Company,  known to be alive on the

restrictions and conditions set forth in the  Participation  Agreement,  neither
this Master Lease nor any provision hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or
terminated  except by an instrument in writing in recordable  form signed by the
parties hereto.

     Section 26.3. No Waiver.  No failure by Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate
Holder, the Administrative Agent, any Participant,  or the Lessee to insist upon
the strict  performance  of any term hereof or to exercise  any right,  power or
remedy upon a default hereunder, and no acceptance of full or partial payment of
Rent during the  continuance of any such default,  shall  constitute a waiver of
any such default or of any such term. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no
waiver of any default shall affect or alter this Master  Lease,  and this Master
Lease shall  continue  in full force and effect  with  respect to any other then
existing or subsequent default.

     Section 26.4. Notices. All notices, demands, requests,  consents, approvals
and other  communications  hereunder  shall be in writing  and  directed  to the
address  described in, and deemed received in accordance with the provisions of,

contents in this Master Lease are for  convenience  of reference  only and shall
not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

     Section 26.7. Counterparts. This Master Lease may be executed in any number
of  counterparts,  each of which  shall be an  original,  but all of which shall

CONSTRUED  AND  INTERPRETED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE  LAWS  OF THE  STATE  OF
CALIFORNIA  WITHOUT  REGARD TO THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  CONFLICTS OF LAWS (EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE  SET FORTH IN THE LEASE  SUPPLEMENT  WITH  RESPECT TO THE CREATION AND
PERFECTION  OF THE LIENS AND SECURITY  INTERESTS IN EACH PROPERTY AND THE RIGHTS
AND  REMEDIES  OF THE LESSOR  TRUST AND THE  PARTICIPANTS  WITH  RESPECT TO EACH
PROPERTY).

Lease marked "THIS  COUNTERPART  IS THE ORIGINAL  EXECUTED  COUNTERPART"  on the

Master  Lease (the  "Original  Executed  Counterpart").  To the extent that this

Commercial  Code  as in  effect  in any  applicable  jurisdiction,  no  security
interest in this Master Lease may be created  through the transfer or possession
of any counterpart other than the Original Executed Counterpart.

     Section  26.10.  Time of  Essence.  With  respect  to each of the  Lessee's
obligations and the Lessee's obligations hereunder,  time is of the essence, and
each such party hereby acknowledges and confirms the foregoing.

Property  that is  subject  to a  ground  lease,  the copy of the  ground  lease
heretofore  furnished  to Lessor is true and correct  and has not been  amended,
modified or terminated in any respect  (except for amendments and  modifications
embodied in written instruments  heretofore delivered to Lessor),  that no event
has  occurred  and  no  condition  exists  which  would  be  a  ground  for  the
cancellation or termination of the ground lease, that the ground lease is valid,
subsisting  and in full force and  effect  and is  subject to no prior  liens or
encumbrances  whatsoever other than Permitted Property Liens. Lessee agrees that
it  will  observe,  comply  with  and be  bound  by each  and all of the  terms,
covenants and agreements imposed on it by any such ground lease.

     Section  26.12.  Acceptance of Trust,  Notice of  Indemnification.  Trustee
accepts  this  Deed  of  Trust  when  this  Deed of  Trust,  duly  executed  and
acknowledged,  becomes a public record as provided by law.  Trustee shall not be


                                       41
<PAGE>

obligated to perform any act required of it hereunder  unless the performance of
such act is requested in writing and Trustee is reasonably  indemnified  against
loss, cost, liability and expense.

     Section  26.13.  Powers of  Trustee.  At any time or from time to time upon
written  request of Beneficiary  and the  presentation of this Deed of Trust and
the Notes and without affecting the personal liability of any person for payment

secured,  Trustee may, without liability  therefor and without notice:  reconvey
all or any  part  of the  Property  consent  to the  making  of any  map or plat
thereof;  join with Lessee in granting any easement thereon; join with Lessee in
any  declaration  of  covenants  and  restrictions;  or join with  Lessee in any
extension  agreement or any agreement  subordinating  the lien or charge hereof.
Trustee or Lessor  Trust may from time to time  apply to any court of  competent
jurisdiction  for aid and direction in the execution of the trusts hereunder and
the enforcement of the rights and remedies available  hereunder,  and Trustee or
Lessor Trust may obtain  orders or decrees  directing or confirming or approving
acts in the  execution  of said  trusts and the  enforcement  of said rights and
remedies.  Lessee shall pay to Trustee reasonable compensation and reimbursement
for services and expenses in the administration of the trusts created hereunder,
including reasonable attorneys' fees.

     Section 26.14. Reconveyance.  Upon Lessor Trust's written request, and upon
surrender  to Trustee of this Deed of Trust and the Notes for  cancellation  and
retention upon payment of its fees,  Trustee shall reconvey,  without  warranty,
any Property or that portion thereof then held  hereunder.  The recitals in such
reconveyance  of  any  matters  or  facts  shall  be  conclusive  proof  of  the
truthfulness  thereof.  To the extent  permitted  by law, the  reconveyance  may
described  the  grantee as "the  person or persons  legally  entitled  thereto".
Neither  Lessor Trust nor Trustee shall have any duty to determine the rights of
persons claiming to be rightful  grantees of any  reconveyance.  When all of the
Property has been fully reconveyed,  the last such reconveyance shall operate as
a reassignment of all future rents, issues and profits of all of the Property to
the  person or  persons  legally  entitled  thereto,  unless  such  reconveyance
expressly provides to the contrary.

     Section  26.15.  No Liability on Trustee or Lessor  Trust.  Notwithstanding
anything  contained herein,  this Deed of Trust is only intended as security for
the  indebtedness  hereby  secured,  and Trustee  and Lessor  Trust shall not be
obligated  to perform or  discharge,  and do not hereby  undertake to perform or
discharge,  any  obligation,  duty or  liability  of Lessee with  respect to any
Property. Except for their gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct, no
liability shall be enforced or asserted against Trustee or Lessor Trust in their
exercise of the powers herein respectively granted to them, and Lessee expressly
waives and  releases any such  liability.  Lessee shall and does hereby agree to
indemnify  and hold  Trustee and Lessor  Trust  harmless of and from any and all
liability,  loss or  damage  which  any of them may or might  incur  under or by
reason of the exercise of their respective  rights hereunder and of and from any
and all claims and demands  whatsoever which may be asserted against any of them
by reason of any alleged  obligations or  undertakings  on any of their parts to
perform  or  discharge  any of the  terms,  covenants  or  agreements  of Lessee
contained herein or with respect to any Property,  except in the case of actions
by  Trustee  or  Lessor  Trust  that  constitute  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct.  Neither Trustee nor Lessor Trust shall have  responsibility for the


                                       42
<PAGE>

control,  care,  management  or  repair  of the  Property,  nor  shall  they  be
responsible or liable for any negligence in the management,  operation,  upkeep,
repair or control of any  Property  resulting  in loss or injury or death to any
licensee,  employee, tenant or stranger. Without limiting the foregoing, neither
Trustee nor Lessor Trust shall be  responsible  for any  recitals  herein or for
insuring any Property, or for the recording,  filing or refiling of this Deed of
Trust;  nor shall Trustee or Lessor Trust be bound to ascertain or inquire as to
the performance or observance of any covenants,  conditions or agreements on the
part of the Lessee contained herein.

     Section 26.16.  Moneys Received by Trustee.  All moneys received by Trustee
shall,  until  used or  applied  as  herein  provided,  be held in trust for the
purposes for which they were received,  but need not be segregated in any manner
from any other moneys,  except to the extent  required by law, and Trustee shall
be under no liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder.

         WHEREAS, the Lessor Trust [is the record owner of] [has a leasehold
interest in] the land described on Schedule I attached hereto (the "Subject

Subject Land (the "Subject Improvements" and, together with the Subject Land,
the "Subject Property");

         WHEREAS, the Lessor Trust desires to lease the Subject Property to the

Trust;

         NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and

and the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, which loans are secured by
such Properties and (C) the Lessee will be treated as the [owner] [sublessee] of
such Properties and will be entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to
an [owner] [sublessee] of properties like such Properties for such tax purposes.

         (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that this Lease Supplement
grants a security interest and deed of trust, as the case may be, on the Subject
Property to the Trustee for the benefit of the Agent Certificate Holder, the
Certificate Holders and the Lenders to secure the Lessee's performance under and
payment of all amounts under the Lease and the other Operative Documents.

Equipment constituting a portion of the Improvements for which Fixed Rent

to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease, the Lessor Trust hereby leases
the Subject Property to the Lessee for the Lease Term (as defined below) of this
Lease Supplement, and the Lessee hereby agrees with the Lessor Trust, expressly
for the direct benefit of the Certificate Holders, to lease the Subject Property

          4. Lease Term; Option to Purchase. The term of this Lease Supplement

additional period of one (1) year (such additional year a "Renewal Term")
pursuant to Section 11.1(a) of the Participation Agreement. The election to
extend the Lease Term for the one (1) year period must be made not earlier than
one (1) year after the Completion Date (as defined in the Participation

and valuable consideration paid by the Lessee to the Administrative Agent as
described in the Master Lease, the Lessor Trust hereby grants to the Lessee the
right to purchase the Subject Property during the Lease Term of this Lease
Supplement on the terms and subject to the conditions (including, without
limitation, payment of the Property Balance thereof) set forth in Sections 15.3
and 18.1 of the Master Lease.

          5. Liens and Security Interests. (a) Specifically, without limiting
the generality of Section 2, the Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder and
the Lessee intend and agree that in the event of any insolvency or receivership
proceedings or a petition under the United States bankruptcy laws or any other
applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United States of America or any
State or Commonwealth thereof affecting the Lessee, any Certificate Holder, any
Lender or any collection actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative
Documents shall be regarded as loans made by the Lenders and the Certificate
Holders as unrelated third party lenders to the Lessee secured by respective
Properties (it being understood that the Lessee hereby deeds and warrants and
grants a security interest in the Subject Property (consisting of a fee deed of
trust or leasehold deed of trust with respect to the Subject Property) to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Agent Certificate Holder, the Certificate Holders
and the Lenders to secure all Certificate Holder Amounts and Loans advanced by
the Participants for the acquisition of the respective Properties and
construction of the Improvements thereon, together with Yield or interest, as
applicable, thereon, and all other amounts payable under the Operative Documents
in connection therewith, effective on the date hereof).

         (b) Specifically, but without limiting the generality of Section 2, the
Lessor Trust, the Agent Certificate Holder and the Lessee further intend and
agree that, for the purpose of securing the obligation of the Lessee for the
repayment of the above-described loans from the Certificate Holders and the


                                       3
<PAGE>

Lenders to the Lessee, (i) the Master Lease and Lease Supplements shall also be
deemed to be a security agreement and financing statement within the meaning of
Article 9 of the California Commercial Code and a real property mortgage or deed
of trust; (ii) the conveyance provided for hereby and in Article II of the
Master Lease shall be deemed to be a grant by the Lessee to the Beneficiary of a
security interest in all of the right, title and interest of the Lessee in and
to the Subject Property and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or
involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, investments, securities or other
property (it being understood that the Lessee hereby deeds and warrants and
grants a security interest in the Subject Property Beneficiary to secure all
Loans and Certificate Holder Amounts advanced by the Participants for the
acquisition of such Properties and construction of Improvements thereon (the
principal amount of which shall not exceed in the aggregate $17,000,000
outstanding at any given time), together with Yield or interest thereon, and all
other amounts payable under the Operative Documents in connection therewith) and
(iii) the possession by the Lessor Trust or any of its agents of notes and such
other items of property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents
or chattel paper shall be deemed to be "possession by the secured party" for
purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to Section 9-305 of the
California Commercial Code. The Lessor Trust and the Lessee shall, to the extent
consistent with the Master Lease and Lease Supplements, take such actions and
execute, deliver, file and record such other documents, financing statements,
mortgages and deeds of trust as may be necessary to ensure that, if the Lease
was deemed to create a security interest in the Properties in accordance with
this Section, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security
interest (subject only to Permitted Property Liens) and will be maintained as
such throughout the Lease Term.

         (c) Specifically, but without limiting the foregoing or the generality
of Section 2, Lessee, as Trustor, hereby grants to the Trustee in trust, with
power of sale, for the benefit of Beneficiary, all of Lessee's right, title, and
interest in and to the following (collectively, the "Mortgaged Property") set
forth in clauses (i) through (x) below and grants to the Beneficiary a security
interest in all of Lessee's right, title and interest in and to the following
set forth in clauses (x) and (xi) below: (i) the Subject Property and

Lessee in any and all leases, rental agreements and arrangements of any sort now

of Lessee in, to and under all management contracts, service contracts, utility

shall be deemed to be a portion of the security for the Indebtedness and Subject
Obligations herein described, a portion of the above described collateral being
located upon the Subject Land.

          6. Remedies. Without limiting any other remedies set forth herein, in
the event that a court of competent jurisdiction rules that each of the Master
Lease and this Lease Supplement constitutes a deed of trust or other secured
financing with respect to the Subject Property as is the intent of the parties
pursuant to Article XXV of the Master Lease, then the Lessor Trust and the
Lessee agree that upon a Lessee Event of Default, Beneficiary may declare all
sums secured hereby immediately due and payable by delivery to Trustee of
written declaration of default and demand for the sale and of written notice of
default and of election to cause to be sold the Subject Property which notice


                                       5
<PAGE>

Trustee shall cause to be filed for record to the extent required by law.
Beneficiary also shall deposit with Trustee the Lease Supplement and all
documents evidencing the Lease Balance and expenditures secured hereby.

         After the lapse of such time as may then be required by law following
the recordation of said notice of default, and notice of sale having been given
as then required by law, Trustee, without demand on Lessee, shall sell said
property at the time and place fixed by it in said notice of sale, either as a
whole or in separate parcels, and in such order as it may determine at public
auction to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of the United States,
payable at time of sale. Trustee may postpone sale of all or any portion of said
property by public announcement at such time and place of sale, and from time to
time thereafter may postpone such sale by public announcement at the time fixed
by the preceding postponement. Trustee shall deliver to such purchaser its deed
conveying the property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or
implied. The recitals in such deed of any matters or facts shall be conclusive
proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any person, including Lessee, Trustee, or
Beneficiary as hereinafter defined, may purchase at such sale. Lessee shall have
all rights available to a Trustor under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
the Subject Property is located except to the extent waived in the Operative
Documents. Lessee agrees that the agreements of Lessee herein contained shall be
specifically enforceable by injunction or any other appropriate equitable remedy
and that for the purpose of any suit brought under this subparagraph, Lessee
hereby waives the defense of laches and any applicable statute of limitations.

         After deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Trustee and of this
Trust, including cost of evidence of title in connection with sale, Trustee
shall apply to proceeds of sale to payment of: all sums expended under the terms
hereof, not then repaid, with accrued interest at the amount allowed by law in
effect at the date hereof; all other sums then secured hereby; and the
remainder, if any, to the person or persons legally entitled thereto. In the
event of foreclosure, Lessee authorizes and empowers Trustee or Beneficiary to
effect insurance upon the Subject Property in amounts aforesaid for a period
covering the time of redemption from foreclosure sale provided by law, and if
necessary therefor, to cancel any or all existing insurance policies. In
connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Beneficiary may elect to treat to
the fullest extent permitted by law any of the Subject Property which consists
of a right in action or which is property that can be severed from the real
property covered hereby or any improvements thereon without causing structural
damage thereto as if the same were personal property, and dispose of the same in
accordance with applicable law, separate and apart from the sale of real
property. Any sale of any personal property hereunder shall be conducted in any
manner permitted by Section 9501 or any other applicable section of the
California Commercial Code. Where the Subject Property consists of real and
personal property or fixtures whether or not such personal property is located
on or within the real property, Beneficiary may elect in its discretion to
exercise its rights and remedies against any or all of the real property,
personal property, and fixtures in such order and manner as is now or hereafter
permitted by applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Beneficiary may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without regard to the
adequacy of its security, elect to proceed against any or all of the real
property, personal property and fixtures in any manner permitted under Section
9501(4)(a) of the California Commercial Code; and if Beneficiary elects to
proceed in the manner permitted under Section 9501(4)(a)(ii) of the California
Commercial Code, the power of sale herein granted shall be exercisable with


                                       6
<PAGE>

respect to all or any of the real property, personal property and fixtures
covered hereby, as designated by Beneficiary, and the Trustee is hereby
authorized and empowered to conduct any such sale of any real property, personal
property and fixtures in accordance with the procedures applicable to real
property. Where the Subject Property consists of real property and personal
property, any reinstatement of the obligation secured hereby, following default
and an election by Beneficiary to accelerate the maturity of said obligation,
which is made by Beneficiary or any other person or entity permitted to exercise
the right of reinstatement under Section 2924c of the California Civil Code or
any successor statute, shall not, in accordance with the terms of California
Commercial Code Section 9501(4)(c)(iii), prohibit Beneficiary from conducting a
sale or other disposition of any personal property or fixtures or from otherwise
proceeding against or continuing to proceed against any personal property or
fixtures in any manner permitted by the California Commercial Code; nor shall
any such reinstatement invalidate, rescind or otherwise affect any sale,
disposition or other proceedings held, conducted or instituted with respect to
any personal property or fixtures prior to such reinstatement or pending at the
time of such reinstatement. Any sums paid to Beneficiary in effecting any
reinstatement pursuant to Section 2924c of the California Civil Code shall be
applied to the secured obligation and to Beneficiary's and Trustee's reasonable
costs and expenses in the manner required by Section 2924c. Should Beneficiary
elect to sell any portion of the Subject Property which is real property or
which is personal property or fixtures that Beneficiary has elected under
Section 9501(4)(a)(ii) of the California Commercial Code to sell together with
real property in accordance with the laws governing a sale of real property,
Beneficiary or Trustee shall give such notice of default and election to sell as
may then be required by law. Any requirement of the California Commercial Code
for reasonable notification shall be met by mailing written notice to Lessee at
its address above set forth at least 10 days prior to the sale or other event
for which such notice is required. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Lease Supplement, Lessee, in accordance with the applicable laws of the
State of California and applicable provisions of the California Rules of
Procedure, or of any other general or local law or rules or regulations of the
State of California relating to deeds of trust does hereby declare and assent to
the passage of a decree to sell the Subject Property by the equity court having
jurisdiction for the sale thereof and the Trustee appointed by such decree of
court shall have, subject to the terms of the decree of court, the same
authority and power to sell on the terms and conditions herein set forth. This
assent to decree shall not be exhausted in the event the proceeding is dismissed
before the indebtedness secured hereby is paid in full.

          7. Non-Responsibility. Nothing contained in this Lease Supplement
shall be construed as constituting the consent or request of the Lessor Trust,
the Agent Certificate Holder, any Certificate Holder, the Administrative Agent,
or any other Participant, expressed or implied, to or for the performance by any
contractor, mechanic, laborer, materialman, supplier or vendor of any labor or
services or for the furnishing of any materials for any construction,
alteration, addition, repair or demolition of or to the Property or any part
thereof. NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT NEITHER THE LESSOR TRUST NOR THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT NOR THE AGENT CERTIFICATE HOLDER NOR ANY CERTIFICATE HOLDER
NOR ANY LENDER IS OR SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LABOR, SERVICES OR MATERIALS
FURNISHED OR TO BE FURNISHED TO THE LESSEE, OR TO ANYONE HOLDING THE PROPERTY OR
ANY PART THEREOF THROUGH OR UNDER THE LESSEE, AND THAT NO MECHANIC'S OR OTHER
LIENS FOR ANY SUCH LABOR, SERVICES OR MATERIALS SHALL ATTACH TO OR AFFECT THE
INTEREST OF THE LESSOR TRUST, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE AGENT CERTIFICATE
HOLDER, ANY CERTIFICATE HOLDER OR ANY LENDER IN AND TO THE PROPERTY.


                                       7
<PAGE>

          8.  Ratification.  The terms and  provisions of the Master Lease are
hereby ratified and confirmed and remain in full force and effect.  In the event
of any  conflict  between  the terms of the  Master  Lease and the terms of this
Lease Supplement, the terms of the Master Lease shall control.

          9. GOVERNING LAW. THE MASTER LEASE AND THIS LEASE SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE CREATION AND PERFECTION OF THE
LIEN CREATED BY THIS LEASE SUPPLEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE LESSOR
TRUST AND/OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AS PROVIDED HEREIN SHALL BE GOVERNED AND
CONSTRUED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OR COMMONWEALTH IN WHICH THE SUBJECT PROPERTY
IS LOCATED WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

          10. Counterpart Execution. This Lease Supplement may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts  and by each of the  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  all such counterparts  together constituting but one and the same
instrument.

          11. Future Advances. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction
rules that this instrument constitutes a mortgage, deed of trust or other
secured financing as is the intent of the parties pursuant to Section 5 hereof,
then this instrument will be deemed given to secure not only existing financing,
but also future advances of up to Seventeen Million Dollars ($17,000,000) made
pursuant to or as provided in the Master Lease, for the matters described in
Section 5, whether such advances are obligatory or to be made at the option of
the Participants, or otherwise, to the same extent as if such future advances
were made on the date of execution of this instrument, although there may be no
advance made at the time of execution hereof, and although there may be no
financing outstanding at the time any advance is made. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the lien of this instrument shall be valid as to all such
amounts, including all future advances, from the time this instrument is
recorded. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed an obligation to make future
advances to the Lessee.

and (b) subject to the rights of the Lessee under the Operative Documents, after
the  expiration or earlier  termination  of the Lease,  convey all of the Lessor
Trust's  right,  title  and  interest  in  and  to the  Property  to  the  Agent
Certificate  Holder or for such amount,  on such terms and to such  purchaser or
purchasers as shall be designated in such  instructions or as may be provided in
the  Lease,  or net lease  the  Property  as  designated  in such  instructions;
provided,  however,  that if such  instructions  have not been  delivered to the
Owner Trustee prior to the expiration of one year  following such  expiration or
earlier termination of the Lease, the Owner Trustee shall transfer title to such
right, title and interest to the Agent Certificate Holder.

         Section 4.3. Indemnification. The Owner Trustee shall not be required
to take or refrain from taking any action under Section 4.1 or 4.2 (other than
the actions specified in the first sentence of Section 4.1 and without limiting
the last sentence of Section 4.4) unless the Owner Trustee shall have been
indemnified by the Agent Certificate Holder, in manner and form reasonably
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee, against any liability, fee, cost or expense
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) which may be incurred
or charged in connection therewith, other than any such liability, fee, cost or
expense which results from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
Owner Trustee; and, in addition, to the extent not otherwise paid pursuant to
the terms of any other Operative Document, the Agent Certificate Holder shall
pay the reasonable compensation and expenses (including counsel fees) of the
Owner Trustee for the services performed or to be performed by it pursuant to
such direction as set forth in Section 6.2. The Owner Trustee shall not be
required to take any action on behalf of the Lessor Trust under any Operative
Document if the Owner Trustee reasonably shall determine, or shall have been
advised by counsel, that such action is likely to result in unindemnified
personal liability to the Lessor Trust or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any documents contemplated hereby to which the Lessor Trust is a party, or
otherwise contrary to law, and the Owner Trustee in such case shall deliver
promptly to the Agent Certificate Holder written notice of the basis of its
refusal to act.

         Section 4.4. No Duties Except as Specified. The Owner Trustee shall not
have any duty or obligation to manage, control, use, make any payment in respect
of, register, record, insure, inspect, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with
the Properties or any other part of the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or
refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any of the
Operative Documents, except as expressly provided by the terms of this Trust
Agreement, the other Operative Documents or in written instructions from the
Agent Certificate Holder received pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2; and no implied
duties or obligations shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Owner
Trustee. Notwithstanding and without limiting the foregoing, Owner Trustee
agrees that it will promptly (without any right to indemnification hereunder)
take all action necessary to discharge any Lessor Lien attributable to Owner
Trustee on any part of the Trust Estate.

         Section 4.5. No Action Except under Specified Agreements or
Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall have no right, power or authority to, and
the Owner Trustee agrees that it will not, manage, control, use, sell, dispose
of or otherwise deal with the Property or any other part of the Trust Estate


                                       4

except as (a) expressly provided by the terms of this Trust Agreement, (b)
expressly required by the terms of any Operative Document or (c) expressly
directed or authorized in written instructions from the Agent Certificate Holder
pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2.

         Section 4.6. Tax Returns; Records. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for the keeping of all appropriate books and records relating to the
receipt and disbursement of all money which the Lessor Trust may receive or be
entitled to hereunder or under any agreement contemplated hereby. The Agent
Certificate Holder, at its expense, shall be responsible for causing to be
prepared all income tax returns required to be filed by the Agent Certificate
Holder. The Owner Trustee shall be responsible for causing to be prepared, at
the request of the Agent Certificate Holder, all income tax returns required to
be filed by or with respect to the Lessor Trust created hereby and shall execute
and file such returns. The Owner Trustee and the Agent Certificate Holder, upon
request, will furnish each other with all such information as may be reasonably
required in connection with the preparation of such tax returns. The Owner
Trustee shall keep copies of all returns delivered to or filed by it.

         Section 4.7. Absence of Certain Duties. Except in accordance with
written instructions furnished pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.2, and except as
expressly provided in any Operative Document, and without limiting the
generality of Section 4.4, the Owner Trustee shall not have any duty (a) to
file, record or deposit any Operative Document, including without limitation
this Trust Agreement, or any other document, or to maintain any such filing,
recording or deposit, or to refile, re-record or redeposit any such document,
(b) to obtain insurance with respect to the Property or to effect or maintain
any such insurance, other than to receive and forward to the Agent Certificate
Holder any notices, policies, certificates or binders furnished to the Owner
Trustee by the Lessee or its insurance brokers, (c) to maintain the Property,
(d) to pay or discharge any tax, assessment or other governmental charge, or any
Lien or encumbrance of any kind, owing with respect to or assessed or levied
against any part of the Trust Estate, except as provided in Section 4.4, (e) to
confirm, verify, investigate or inquire into the failure to receive any reports
or financial statements of the Guarantor, (f) to inspect the Property at any
time, or to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the covenants of the Lessee or any other Person under any Operative Document
with respect to the Property or any other part of the Trust Estate or (g) to
manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Properties or
any other part of the Trust Estate, or any part thereof, except as provided in
clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 4.5.

         Section 4.8. Furnishing of Documents. The Owner Trustee will furnish to
the Agent Certificate Holder and each other Certificate Holder, promptly upon
receipt thereof by an officer in the Corporate Trust Department of the Trust
Company, duplicates or copies of all reports, notices, requests, demands,
opinions, certificates, financial statements and any other instruments furnished
to the Owner Trustee under any Operative Document, unless the Owner Trustee
shall have determined that the same already has been furnished to the Agent
Certificate Holder and the other Certificate Holders.

                                THE OWNER TRUSTEE

         Section 5.1. Acceptance of Trusts and Duties. The Owner Trustee accepts
the trusts hereby created and agrees to perform the same on the terms of this
Trust Agreement. The Owner Trustee also agrees to disburse all moneys actually
received by it constituting part of the Trust Estate pursuant to the terms of
Article VII of the Participation Agreement. The Owner Trustee shall not be
answerable or accountable under any circumstances except (a) for its own willful
misconduct or gross negligence, (b) in the case of the inaccuracy of any of its
representations or warranties contained in Section 5.2 hereof or in Section 8.4
of the Participation Agreement given expressly in its individual capacity and
not in its capacity as a trustee hereunder, (c) as arising from its failure to
perform obligations expressly undertaken by it in the last sentence of Section
4.4 hereof or expressly undertaken by it in its individual capacity under the
Participation Agreement, (d) for any Taxes based on or measured by any fees,
commissions or compensation received by it for acting as Owner Trustee in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents,
or (e) for its failure to disburse funds actually received by it in accordance
with the terms hereof.

         Section 5.2. No Representations or Warranties as to Equipment or
Documents. (a) NEITHER TRUST COMPANY NOR THE OWNER TRUSTEE MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE DESIGN,
OPERATION OR CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE TRUST ESTATE OR
ANY PART THEREOF, THE MERCHANTABILITY THEREOF OR THE FITNESS THEREOF FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE TO THE PROPERTY OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE TRUST ESTATE
OR ANY PART THEREOF, THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS OR WORKMANSHIP THEREOF OR
CONFORMITY THEREOF TO SPECIFICATIONS, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ANY LATENT
OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT discoverable, except that the Owner Trustee
hereby represents and warrants that (i) on the Acquisition Date, the Lessor
Trust shall have received whatever title to the Property was conveyed to it by
transferor thereof and (ii) the Property shall be free and clear of Lessor Liens
attributable to it, and (b) neither Trust Company nor the Owner Trustee makes
any representation or warranty as to the validity or enforceability of any
Operative Document, or as to the correctness of any statement therein, except to
the extent that any such representation, warranty or statement is expressly made
therein or in any written certificate delivered pursuant thereto by the Owner
Trustee or Trust Company and except that Trust Company hereby represents and
warrants that this Trust Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Trust
Company and each of the Operative Documents has been or will be executed and
delivered on behalf of the Lessor Trust by officers of the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Trustee who are or will be duly authorized to execute and deliver
documents on its behalf and on behalf of the Lessor Trust.

         Section 5.3. Segregation of Moneys; No Interest. Moneys (if any)
received by the Owner Trustee hereunder shall be segregated from the general
assets of the Owner Trustee and held in trust for the benefit of the Person
entitled thereto under the Operative Documents, and the Owner Trustee shall not
be liable for any interest thereon.

         Section 5.4. Reliance; Advice of Counsel. The Owner Trustee shall not
incur any liability to anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, notice,
resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other
document or paper reasonably believed by it in good faith to be genuine and
reasonably believed by it in good faith to be signed by the proper party or
parties. Any request, direction, order or demand of the Agent Certificate Holder
or the Lessee mentioned herein or in any other Operative Document shall be
sufficiently evidenced by a written direction of Agent Certificate Holder or a
Responsible Officer's Certificate of the Lessee, as the case may be. The Owner
Trustee may accept in good faith a certified copy of a resolution of the Board
of Directors or other governing body of any corporate party as conclusive
evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted by such body and that the
same is in full force and effect. As to any fact or matter the manner of
ascertainment of which is not specifically prescribed herein, the Owner Trustee
may for all purposes hereof rely on a Responsible Officer's Certificate of the
relevant party as to such fact or matter, and such Responsible Officer's
Certificate shall constitute full protection to the Owner Trustee for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon. In the
administration of the trusts hereunder, the Owner Trustee may execute any of the
trusts or powers hereof and perform its powers and duties hereunder directly or
through agents or attorneys, and may consult with counsel, accountants and other
skilled Persons to be selected and employed by it (other than Persons regularly
employed by it), and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for anything done,
suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the written advice or
opinion within the scope of the competence of any such counsel, accountants or
other skilled Persons and not contrary to this Trust Agreement or in the
Participation Agreement and except for the use of due care in the appointment of
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons.

         Section 5.5. Not Acting in Individual Capacity. Except as provided in
this Trust Agreement and in the other Operative Documents, in accepting the
trusts hereby created the Owner Trustee agrees to act solely as trustee
hereunder and not in its individual capacity; and all Persons having any claim
against the Lessor Trust or the Owner Trustee by reason of the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Documents shall look only to the Trust Estate (or
a part thereof, as the case may be) for payment or satisfaction thereof, except
as specifically provided in this Trust Agreement or in the Participation
Agreement and except to the extent the Owner Trustee otherwise shall agree in
any Operative Document.


                                   ARTICLE VI
                          INDEMNIFICATION; COMPENSATION

         Section 6.1. Indemnification of Trust Company. The Agent Certificate
Holder agrees to assume liability for, and to indemnify and hold harmless Trust
Company against and from any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
taxes (excluding any taxes, fees or other charges payable by Trust Company or
measured by any compensation received by the Owner Trustee for its services
hereunder), penalties, claims, actions, suits, proceedings, costs, expenses and
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever, including without limitation
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (collectively, "Trust Expenses")
which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Trust Company (whether
or not also indemnified by any other Person; provided, however, that to the
extent Trust Company is entitled to and shall have actually received any payment


                                       7
<PAGE>

in the nature of an indemnity payment from any such other Person relating to a
claim hereunder, Trust Company shall not be entitled to the amount of any such
payment pursuant to this Section 6.1, notwithstanding that Trust Company may
have returned any such amount to the paying party), in any way relating to or
arising out of (a) the administration of the Trust Estate or the action or
inaction of Trust Company hereunder or under the other Operative Documents, (b)
the Property or any part thereof, (c) the Operative Documents or any of them, or
the enforcement by Trust Company of any of its rights under the Operative
Documents, or (d) the purchase, design, construction, preparation, installation,
inspection, delivery, nondelivery, acceptance, rejection, ownership, management,
possession, operation, rental, lease, sublease, repossession, maintenance,
repair, alteration, modification, addition or substitution, storage, transfer of
title, redelivery, use, financing or refinancing, disposition, operation,
condition, sale, return or other disposition of all or any part or any interest
in the Property or the imposition of any Lien (or incurring of any liability to
refund or pay over any amount as a result of any Lien) thereon; except only that
the Agent Certificate Holder shall not be required to indemnify Trust Company
for Trust Expenses arising or resulting from any of the matters described in
clauses (a) through (e) of the last sentence of Section 5.1; provided that the
Agent Certificate Holder shall be liable under this Section 6.1 only to the
extent that the Owner Trustee would be indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to
Article XIII of the Participation Agreement (without giving effect to clause (4)
of the Proviso to Section 13.1 thereof), but the foregoing shall not limit the
Owner Trustee's rights under Section 4.3 hereof; provided, further, that before
asserting its right to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Owner
Trustee shall first demand its corresponding right to indemnification, if any,
pursuant to Article XIII of the Participation Agreement (but need not exhaust
any or all remedies available thereunder), and the Agent Certificate Holder
shall have the right to pursue any such remedies against the Lessee which are
not pursued by the Owner Trustee. The indemnities contained in this Section 6.1
shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement. The indemnities contained
in this Section 6.1 extend to Trust Company only and shall not be construed as
indemnities of the Trust Estate. The payor of any indemnity under this Section
6.1 shall be subrogated to any right of the Person indemnified in respect of the
matter as to which such indemnity was paid.

         Section 6.2. Expenses. The Agent Certificate Holder shall pay, or
reimburse the Owner Trustee for, all reasonable expenses of the Owner Trustee,
including, without limitation, the reasonable expenses and disbursements of such
agents, representatives, experts and counsel as the Owner Trustee may employ in
connection with the exercise and performance of its rights and duties under the
Operative Documents, unless and to the extent that the Owner Trustee otherwise
receives payment or reimbursement pursuant to any Operative Document, whether or
not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Owner Trustee
agrees to look first to the Lessee for such payment pursuant to Article IX of
the Participation Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE VII
                         TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT

         Section 7.1. Termination of Trust Agreement. (a) Subject to the terms
of the Participation Agreement and Section 7.2, this Trust Agreement and the
trusts created hereby shall terminate and the Trust Estate shall be distributed
to the Agent Certificate Holder, and this Trust Agreement shall be of no further


                                       8
<PAGE>

force or effect (subject to the antepenultimate sentence of Section 6.1), and
the Trust Company and the Owner Trustee shall be released from all further
obligations of the Trust Company and the Owner Trustee, respectively, hereunder,
upon the earlier of (i) the sale or other final disposition by the Lessor Trust
of all property constituting part of the Trust Estate and the final distribution
by the Owner Trustee of all moneys or other property or proceeds constituting
part of the Trust Estate in accordance with the Operative Documents and (ii) 110
years from the date of the earlier execution of this Trust Agreement by either
party hereto, but if any such rights, privileges or options shall be or become
valid under Applicable Law for a period subsequent to the 110 years from such
date (or, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if legislation shall
become effective providing for the validity or permitting the effective grant of
such rights, privileges and options for a period in gross exceeding the period
for which such rights, privileges and options are hereinabove stated to extend
and be valid), then such rights, privileges or options shall not terminate as
aforesaid but shall extend to and continue in effect, but only if such
nontermination and extension shall then be valid under Applicable Law, until
such time as the same shall cease to be valid under Applicable Law.

         (b) Except as expressly provided in Section 7.2, the Agent Certificate
Holder shall not be entitled to revoke or terminate this Trust Agreement or the
Lessor Trust created hereby.

         Section 7.2. Termination at Option of the Agent Certificate Holder. The
provisions of Section 7.1 notwithstanding, this Trust Agreement and the trusts
created hereby shall terminate and the Trust Estate shall be distributed to the
Agent Certificate Holder, and this Trust Agreement shall be of no further force
and effect (subject to the antepenultimate sentence of Section 6.1), and the
Trust Company and the Owner Trustee shall be released from all further
obligations of the Trust Company and the Owner Trustee, respectively, hereunder,
upon the election of the Agent Certificate Holder by notice to the Owner Trustee
to revoke the trusts created hereby; provided, however, that so long as the
Participation Agreement is in effect the Agent Certificate Holder shall not
terminate or revoke the trusts created hereby unless consented to by all of the
parties to the Participation Agreement.


                                  ARTICLE VIII
                   SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEES, CO-OWNER TRUSTEES
                           AND SEPARATE OWNER TRUSTEES

         Section 8.1. Resignation of the Owner Trustee; Appointment of
Successor. (a) The Owner Trustee may resign as the Owner Trustee at any time
without cause by giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the
Agent Certificate Holder, the Administrative Agent and the Lessee, such
resignation to be effective on the acceptance of appointment by a successor to
the Owner Trustee under paragraph (b) of this Section 8.1 (which successor
Trustee shall be subject to prior consent by the Lessee which shall not be
unreasonably withheld and shall not be required during the continuance of a
Default or Event of Default). In addition, the Agent Certificate Holder at any
time may remove the Owner Trustee without cause by an instrument in writing
delivered to the Owner Trustee, the Administrative Agent and the Lessee, such
removal to be effective upon the acceptance of appointment by a successor to the
Owner Trustee under paragraph (b) of this Section 8.1 (which successor Trustee
shall be subject to prior consent by the Lessee which shall not be unreasonably
withheld and shall not be required during the continuance of a Default or Event
of Default). In case of the resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee, the
Agent Certificate Holder may appoint a successor to the Owner Trustee by an
instrument in writing, signed by the Agent Certificate Holder (which successor
Trustee shall be subject to prior consent by the Lessee which shall not be
unreasonably withheld and shall not be required during the continuance of a
Default or an Event of Default). If a successor to the Owner Trustee shall not
have been appointed within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice
of such resignation or the delivery of the written instrument with respect to
such removal, the Owner Trustee or the Agent Certificate Holder may apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor to the Owner Trustee to
act until such time, if any, as a successor shall have been appointed as above


                                       9
<PAGE>

provided in this Section 8.1. Any successor to the Owner Trustee so appointed by
such court shall immediately and without further act be superseded by any
successor to the Owner Trustee appointed as above provided in this Section 8.1.

         (b) Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall execute and
deliver to the predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment and shall give the Agent Certificate Holder, the Administrative
Agent and the Lessee written notice of such acceptance. Upon the execution and
delivery of such instrument, such successor Owner Trustee, without further act,
shall become vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and
trusts of the predecessor Owner Trustee in the Lessor Trust hereunder with like
effect as if originally named a trustee herein; provided, however, that upon the
written request of such successor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner Trustee
shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Owner
Trustee, upon the trusts herein expressed, all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, duties and trusts of such predecessor trustee as the Owner Trustee
hereunder, and such predecessor trustee shall duly assign, transfer, deliver and
pay over to such successor Owner Trustee all moneys or other property then held
by such predecessor trustee as the Owner Trustee upon the trusts herein
expressed. Upon the appointment of any successor Owner Trustee hereunder, the
predecessor Owner Trustee, pursuant to written instructions of the Agent
Certificate Holder, will execute all documents and take all reasonable action
within its control in order to cause title to the Trust Estate to be transferred
to the successor Owner Trustee.

         (c) Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall be a bank or
trust company incorporated and doing business within the United States of
America, qualified to act as trustee hereunder and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $100,000,000, if there be such an institution willing, able
and legally qualified to perform the duties of the Owner Trustee hereunder upon
reasonable or customary terms.

         (d) Any corporation into which the Owner Trustee may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Owner Trustee shall be
a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Owner Trustee may be transferred, shall be, subject to
compliance with the terms of paragraph (c) of this Section 8.1, the Owner
Trustee under this Trust Agreement without further act.


                                       10
<PAGE>

         Section 8.2. Additional and Separate Trustees. (a) If the Owner Trustee
or the Agent Certificate Holder shall conclude that it is necessary or prudent
in order to conform to the law of any jurisdiction in which all or any part of
the Trust Estate shall be situated, or to make or defend any claim or bring or
defend any suit with respect to the Trust Estate or any Operative Document, or
pursuant to advice of counsel satisfactory to it, or if the Owner Trustee shall
have been instructed to do so by the Agent Certificate Holder, the Owner Trustee
shall appoint another Person to act as additional or separate trustee for all or
any part of the Trust Estate with such property, title, right, power or duty of
the Owner Trustee as the Owner Trustee and the Agent Certificate Holder may
determine. In case any such additional trustee or separate trustee shall resign
or be removed, all the assets, property, rights, powers or duties of such
additional trustee or separate trustee, as the case may be, so far as permitted
by any Applicable Law, shall vest in and be exercised by a new successor to such
additional trustee, appointed in the manner otherwise provided in this Trust
Agreement.

         (b) In the event that either the Agent Certificate Holder or the Owner
Trustee shall determine to appoint another Person as additional or separate
trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Agent Certificate Holder shall execute and
deliver an agreement supplemental hereto, and all other instruments and
agreements necessary or proper to constitute another bank or trust company, or
one or more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee, the Agent Certificate Holder
and the Lessee, either to act as an additional trustee or trustees of all or any
part of the Trust Estate, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or to act as separate
trustee or trustees of all or any part of the Trust Estate, in any such case
with such powers of the Owner Trustee as may be provided in such agreement
supplemental hereto, and to vest in such bank, trust company or Person as such
additional trustee or separate trustee, as the case may be, any property, title,
right, or power of the Owner Trustee deemed necessary or proper by the Owner
Trustee or the Agent Certificate Holder, subject to the remaining provisions of
this Section 8.2. In the event the Agent Certificate Holder shall not have
joined in the execution of such agreement supplemental hereto within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of a written request from the Owner Trustee so to do
without providing a reasonable basis for such failure to join, the Owner Trustee
may act under the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2 without the
concurrence of the Agent Certificate Holder; and the Agent Certificate Holder
hereby appoints the Owner Trustee its agent and attorney-in-fact to act for the
Agent Certificate Holder under the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2 in
the event of the occurrence of either of such contingencies. The Owner Trustee
may execute, deliver and perform any deed, conveyance, assignment or other
instrument in writing as may be required by an additional trustee or separate
trustee for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such Person
any property, title, right or power which, by the terms of such agreement
supplemental hereto, are expressed to be conveyed or conferred to or upon such
additional trustee or separate trustee, and the Agent Certificate Holder shall,
upon the Owner Trustee's request, join therein and execute, acknowledge and
deliver the same; and the Agent Certificate Holder hereby appoints the Owner
Trustee its agent and attorney-in-fact to execute, acknowledge and deliver any
such deed, conveyance, assignment or other instrument in the event that such
Agent Certificate Holder shall not itself execute and deliver the same within
thirty (30) days after receipt by it of such request so to do.

                                       11
<PAGE>

         (c) Every additional trustee and separate trustee hereunder shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be appointed to act and the Owner Trustee shall
act, subject to the following provisions and conditions:

                   (i) all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred or
         imposed upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the receipt, custody,
         investment and payment of moneys, shall be exercised solely by the
         Owner Trustee;

                  (ii) all other rights, powers, duties, and obligations
         conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred or
         imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Owner Trustee and such
         additional trustee or trustees and separate trustee or trustees
         jointly, except to the extent that under any law of the jurisdiction in
         which any particular act or acts are to be performed by the Owner
         Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or
         acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties, and obligations
         (including the holding of title to the Trust Estate in any such
         jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by such additional
         trustee or trustees or separate trustee or trustees;

                 (iii) no power hereby given to or which may be exercised by any
         such additional trustee or separate trustee shall be exercised
         hereunder by such additional trustee or separate trustee except jointly
         with, or with the consent of, the Owner Trustee; and

                 (iv) no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason
of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder.

         (d) If at any time the Owner Trustee and the Agent Certificate Holder
shall deem it no longer necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
Applicable Law or shall be advised by its counsel that it is no longer necessary
or prudent in the interest of the Owner Trustee and the Agent Certificate Holder
to maintain the appointment of such additional or separate trustee as provided
herein, the Owner Trustee and the Agent Certificate Holder shall execute and
deliver any agreement supplemental hereto and all other instruments and
agreements necessary or proper to remove any such additional or separate
trustee. In the event that the Agent Certificate Holder shall not have joined in
the execution of such agreement supplemental hereto, instruments and agreements,
the Owner Trustee may act on behalf of the Agent Certificate Holder to the same
extent provided above in this Section 8.2.

         (e) Any additional trustee or separate trustee may at any time by an
instrument in writing constitute the Owner Trustee its agent or attorney-in-fact
with full power and authority, to the extent which may be authorized by
Applicable Law, to do all acts and things and exercise all discretion which it

SECTION 6.           THE LESSOR TRUST REMAINS LIABLE.

         While the assignment made hereby is present, direct and continuing, it
has been made for the purpose of providing the Lenders with security for the
performance of the obligations of the Lessor Trust under the Loan Agreement and
the Notes and the execution and delivery hereof shall not impair or diminish in
any way the obligations of the Lessor Trust under the Assigned Leases, or impose
any of such obligations on the Administrative Agent or any Lender. This
Assignment shall not operate to cause the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
be regarded as a "mortgagee in possession." Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any Lender shall be responsible or liable for performing any of the obligations
of the Lessor Trust under any of the Assigned Lease or any Contract, for any
waste by any Lessee or any other Person, for any dangerous or defective
conditions of the Property, for negligence in the management, upkeep, repair or
control of the Property or any other act or omission by any other Person.
Nothing contained herein shall operate or be construed to (a) obligate the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to assume the obligations of the Lessor Trust
under the Assigned Lease or any Contract, to perform any of the terms and
conditions contained in the Assigned Lease or any Contract or otherwise to
impose any obligation upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect
to the Assigned Lease or any Contract or (b) place upon the Administrative Agent

repair of the Property or any part thereof. Subject at all times to the terms

and faithfully perform in all respects, or cause to be performed in all
respects, all of its covenants, conditions and agreements contained in the
Assigned Lease or any Contract now or hereafter existing on the part of the
Lessor Trust to be kept and performed.

SECTION 7.           AMENDMENTS TO THE ASSIGNED LEASE.

         The Lessor Trust will not enter into any agreement subordinating,
amending, extending or terminating the Assigned Lease except as provided in
Section 15.5 of the Participation Agreement, and any such attempted
subordination, amendment, modification, extension or termination without
compliance with such Section 15.5 shall be void. If the Assigned Lease or any
Contract shall be amended, it shall continue to be subject to the provisions
hereof without the necessity of any further act by any of the parties hereto.

SECTION 8.           TERMINATION OF THIS ASSIGNMENT.

the Lenders from the Lessor Trust or the Lessee under or with respect to the
Loan Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents, or which are otherwise
secured hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising or incurred, have been
fully paid, performed and satisfied, at which time this Assignment will

for sequestration of rents, or the appointment of a receiver or some similar
judicial action or order is deemed required under applicable state law to allow
the Administrative Agent to continue to collect the moneys described in Sections
2(a), (b) and (c) of this Assignment, then it is agreed by the Lessor Trust that
any proof of claim or similar document filed by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the breach or rejection of the Assigned Lease by the Lessee or
the trustee of the Lessee under any federal or state insolvency statute shall
for the purpose of perfecting the Administrative Agent's rights conferred in
said paragraphs be deemed to constitute action required under such state law.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Loan Agreement Event of
Default (not existing solely by virtue of a Lease Event of Default), the Lessor
Trust hereby consents to the appointment of a receiver for the Property as a
matter of right and without any requirement for notice to the Lessor Trust and
without regard to the solvency of the Lessor Trust or to the collateral that may
be available for the satisfaction of the Notes and all other obligations under
the Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents.

SECTION 10.          AMENDMENT TO THIS ASSIGNMENT.

and assigns, whether or not so expressed.

provisions, in this Assignment is found by a court of law of competent
jurisdiction to be in violation of any local, state or Federal ordinance,
statute, law, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, and if such

invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable portion, provision or provisions were
not contained therein, and that the rights, obligations and interests of the
Lessor Trust, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Lessee under the
remainder of this Assignment shall continue in full force and effect.

         The Lessor Trust further intends and agrees that, for the purpose of
securing the payment of all the amounts owing to the Lenders under the Operative
Documents, (i) this Assignment shall also be deemed to be a security agreement
and financing statement within the meaning of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code; (ii) the assignment provided for in Section 2 shall be deemed
to be a grant by the Lessor Trust to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Lenders of, and the Lessor Trust does hereby grant to the Administrative

other items of property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents
or chattel paper shall be deemed to be "possession by the secured party" for
purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to Section 9-305 of the
Uniform Commercial Code; and (iv) notifications to Persons holding such
property, and acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from financial
intermediaries, bankers or agents (as applicable) of the Lessor Trust shall be

deliver, file and record such other documents, financing statements, mortgages
and deeds of trust as may be necessary to ensure that, if this Assignment was
deemed to create a security interest in the items described in Section 2 in
accordance with this Section, such security interest would be deemed to be a
perfected security interest and will be maintained as such throughout the Lease
Term.

          twelve (12) months before the Interim Termination Date;

               (g) cause the  aggregate  Property  Cost for such Property not to
          exceed 110% of the sum of the Land  Acquisition Cost and the Estimated
          Improvement  Costs for such  Property;  provided that it shall have no
          obligation to pay for  Construction  Costs unless it is entitled to be
          reimbursed for such  Construction  Costs pursuant to the Participation
          Agreement; and

               (h) as between the parties to the Operative  Documents,  maintain
          such Property in safe  condition  free from injury or mishaps to third
          Persons.

     Section 2.8.  Insurance.  (a) During the Interim Lease Term with respect to
each Property,  the  Construction  Agent shall procure and carry,  the insurance
described in Section 13.1 of the Master Lease for the risks insured arising from
the acts or omissions of the Construction  Agent while located on, in possession
of, or  controlling  or acting or failing to act with respect to such  Property.
The premium for any such coverage  maintained by the Construction Agent for each
Property  shall be a  Construction  Cost paid with the  proceeds  of an Advance;
provided however that the Construction  Agent shall pay or cause to be paid such
premium  on behalf of the  Lessor  Trust  and  Agent  Certificate  Holder if the
conditions  precedent for such Advance cannot be met at the time such premium is
due  and  payable.  The  Construction  Agent  acknowledges  and  agrees  in this
connection  that each  Property  is in its  control  and  possession  during the
Interim Lease Term therefore,  it is responsible as  Construction  Agent for the
acts and  omissions of its  subcontractors  and agents and that it has agreed to
maintain each Property free from injury and mishap to third Persons.

     (b)  During the  Interim  Lease Term with  respect  to each  Property,  the
Construction  Agent shall in the  construction  of Improvements on such Property
and the operation of such Property, comply with applicable worker's compensation
laws.

     (c)  During  the  Interim  Lease Term with  respect  to each  Property  the
Construction  Agent shall also maintain or cause to be  maintained,  and keep in
force,  a policy or policies of builder's  "all risk"  insurance with respect to
such  Property  that is  insurable  and  that is  insured  by  Lessee  for  wine
production,  distribution  or  storage  facilities  owned by it in its  ordinary
course  of  business,  insuring  the  interest  of the  Lessor  Trust  and Agent
Certificate  Holder in such  Property in an amount  equal to the greater (x) the
replacement  value  of  such  Improvements  and (y)  the  aggregate  cost of the
construction of the Improvements,  including costs that may be required to cause
Property to be reconstructed and then current Requirements of Law and in amounts
sufficient  to fund all  interest,  Yield  and fees  accruing  on the  Loans and
Certificate  Holder  Amounts or otherwise  payable during the Interim Lease Term
for  such  Property.  The  premium  for  any  such  coverage  maintained  by the
Construction  Agent shall be a  Construction  Cost paid with the  proceeds of an
Advance; provided, however, that the Construction Agent shall pay or cause to be
paid such premium on behalf of the Lessor Trust and Agent Certificate  Holder if
the conditions precedent for such Advance cannot be met at the time such premium
is due and payable.

     (d) The  insurance  required to be maintained  under Section  2.8(a) may be
subject to deductible amounts and self-insured  retentions as is consistent with
the Construction Agent's or its Affiliates practice for other properties similar
to the  applicable  Property  owned or leased by the  Construction  Agent or the
Affiliates of the Construction  Agent, and may be carried under blanket policies
maintained  by or on behalf of the  Construction  Agent so long as such policies
otherwise comply with the provisions of this Section 2.8. The insurance required
to be maintained  pursuant to Section 2.8(c) shall contain no deductible amount,
unless the Required Participants otherwise agree. In the event that the Required
Participants in their sole discretion, agree to permit a deductible amount under
the policy required  pursuant to Section  2.8(c),  the reduction in any recovery
pursuant to any such permitted deductible shall be a Construction Cost paid with
the proceeds of an Advance; provided, however, that the Construction Agent shall
pay to the Lessor  Trust (for the benefit of the Agent  Certificate  Holders) an
amount equal to the deductible if the conditions precedent for an Advance cannot
be met at the time such  deductible  amount  shall be  payable;  subject  to the
limitations set forth in Section 5.4 hereof.

     (e) All insurance  required to be carried  pursuant to the  requirements of
Section 2.8(a) or 2.8(c) shall be written by reputable  insurance companies that
are  financially  sound  and  solvent  and  otherwise   reasonably   appropriate
considering  the amount and type of insurance  being provided by such companies.
Any  insurance  company  selected  by the  Construction  Agent which is rated in
Best's  Insurance  Guide or any  successor  thereto  (or if  there  be none,  an
organization  having a similar national  reputation) shall have a general policy
holder rating of "A-" or better and a financial size rating of at least "VII" or
be otherwise  acceptable to the Lenders and the Agent Certificate  Holders.  All
insurance required under Section 2.8(a) or 2.8(c) shall provide in the policy or
by special endorsement that:

               (i) in the case of  insurance  required by Section  2.8(a),  each
          Participant, the Lessor Trust and Administrative Agent are included as
          additional insureds,  and in the case of insurance required by Section
          2.8(c),  naming  the  Participants  as their  interest  may appear and
          naming the  Administrative  Agent as loss payee and showing a standard
          form mortgagee endorsement in favor of the Participants;

               (ii) such policy will not be invalidated  should the Construction
          Agent  waive,  in  writing,  prior to a loss,  any and all  rights  of
          recovery  against any party for losses covered by such policy (and the
          Construction  Agent hereby waives any and all such rights  against the
          Agent  Certificate  Holders  and the Lenders to the extent of payments
          made under such policies);

               (iii)  such   insurance   shall  be  primary   without  right  of
          contribution  of any other  insurance  carried  by or on behalf of any
          Participant,  the Lessor Trust or the  Administrative  Agent and shall
          provide that no such Person shall have any obligation or liability for
          payments of premiums;

               (iv) the  respective  interests of the  Participants,  the Lessor
          Trust  and the  Administrative  Agent  under  all  insurance  policies
          required  hereunder  shall not be invalidated or reduced by any act or
          omission (including breach of warranty) or negligence of the Lessee or
          the  Construction  Agent or any other Person (other than, with respect

                                       6
<PAGE>

          to any such  insured,  such insured) and such  insurance  shall insure
          each Participant,  the Lessor Trust and Administrative  Agent as their
          interest  may appear,  regardless  of any breach or  violation  of any
          warranty,  declaration or condition  contained in such policies by the
          Lessee,  the Construction  Agent or any other Person (other than, with
          respect to any such insured, such insured);

                   (v) if the insurers cancel such insurance for any reason
         whatsoever or any materially adverse change is made in policy terms or
         conditions, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for non-payment of
         premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as
         to the Participants, the Lessor Trust and the Administrative Agent for
         thirty (30) days after receipt by the Participants, the Lessor Trust
         and the Administrative Agent, respectively, of written notice from such
         insurers or such cancellation, change or lapse; and

               (vi) with respect to all liability  insurance,  in as much as the
          policies  are  written  to cover  more than one  insured,  all  terms,
          conditions,  insuring agreements and endorsements,  with the exception
          of the limits of  liability,  shall  operate in the same  manner as if
          there were a separate policy covering each insured.

     (f) The  Construction  Agent shall pay or cause to be paid,  as they become
due all  premiums  for the  insurance  required  hereunder,  and shall  renew or
replace, or cause to be renewed or replaced, each policy prior to the expiration
date  thereof;  provided  that  the  Construction  Agent  shall be  entitled  to
reimbursement therefor as a Construction Cost.

     (g) Throughout the Interim Lease Term for each Property,  the  Construction
Agent shall,  upon request  therefor  from the Agent  Certificate  Holder or the
Administrative   Agent,   deliver  to  the  Agent  Certificate  Holder  and  the
Administrative  Agent  certificates  of insurance  evidencing that all insurance
required by this Section 2.8 is being maintained by the  Construction  Agent and
is in effect.

     Section 2.9.  Plans and  Specifications;  Estimated  Improvement  Cost. The
Construction  Agent  hereby  represents  and warrants to each  Participant  with
respect  to each  Property  from time to time  subject to a  supplement  to this
Agreement that:

               (a) set forth on Schedule II to each supplement to this Agreement
          shall  be  a  true,  correct  and  complete  copy  of  the  Plans  and
          Specifications  for the Property  described in such supplement,  as in
          effect on the date thereof; and

               (b)  set  forth  in each  supplement  to  this  Agreement  as the
          "Estimated   Improvement   Costs"   shall  be  the  amount  which  the
          Construction  Agent  in  good  faith  expects,  as of  the  applicable
          Acquisition  Date, to be expended for Construction of the Improvements
          described in such supplement to achieve Completion.

Holder);  provided,  however, that the prior written consent of the Lessor Trust
(at the  direction  of the Agent  Certificate  Holder)  will be required if such
revision,  amendment or  modification,  when taken together with any previous or
contemporaneous   revision,   amendment  or   modification  to  such  Plans  and
Specifications,  could  reasonably be expected to: (w) result in the  Completion
Date of the applicable Property occurring after the Outside Completion Date, (x)
result in the Property Cost for such Property  exceeding  110% of the sum of the
Land Acquisition Cost for such Property and the Estimated  Improvement Costs for
such  Property,  (y)  reduce  the Fair  Market  Sales  Value as set forth in the
Appraisal of such Property in a material  respect when  completed,  or (z) cause
the  Improvements  to vary in any  material  respect from the  assumptions  with
respect to use,  operation and  construction  set forth in the Appraisal of such
Property delivered in connection with the Acquisition Date therefore;  provided,
further,  however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the prior written consent
of the Agent Certificate Holders will not be required if, and only to the extent
that,  such  revision,   amendment  or   modification   constitutes  a  Required
Modification.

     (b) The  Construction  Agent may, at any time during the Interim Lease Term
for any  Property,  revise the Estimated  Improvement  Cost for such Property by
delivering to the Administrative Agent a certificate,  executed by a Responsible

110%  of the  Fair  Market  Sales  Value  of  such  Property  set  forth  in the
As-Constructed Appraisal thereof.

time prior to the  Completion  Date for any  Property  there  occurs a Casualty,

Property under any property damage policies required to be carried under Section
2.8(c) shall be adjusted with the insurance  companies,  including the filing of
appropriate proceedings, as follows: (x) so long as no Lease Event of Default or
Construction  Agency  Agreement  Event of  Default  shall have  occurred  and be
continuing, and provided that the Lessee is required by the Operative Documents,
or has  agreed,  to repair the damage to the  applicable  Property,  such losses
shall be  adjusted  by the  Lessee,  and (y) if any Lease  Event of  Default  or
Construction  Agency  Agreement  Event of  Default  shall have  occurred  and be
continuing,  or if the Lessee is not required to, and has not agreed,  to repair
the damage to the  applicable  Property,  such  losses  shall be adjusted by the
Administrative  Agent.  The party which  shall be entitled to adjust  losses may
appear in any proceeding or action to negotiate, prosecute, adjust or appeal any
claim for any  award,  compensation  or  insurance  payment  on  account  of any
Casualty;  provided, that the Construction Agent shall pay all expenses thereof;

any such losses, and at the Construction  Agent's sole cost and expense (subject
to  Section  5.4  hereof),  the  other  party  shall  participate  in  any  such
proceeding,  action, negotiation,  prosecution or adjustment. The parties hereto
agree that this  Construction  Agency  Agreement shall control the rights of the
parties  hereto in and to any such  award,  compensation  or  insurance  payment

account of any damage to or  destruction  of any  Property  or any part  thereof
shall be paid over to the  Administrative  Agent or as it may  direct;  provided

the  Lessor  Trust  and the  Administrative  Agent  shall  be  entitled,  to the
exclusion of the Construction Agent, to negotiate,  prosecute,  adjust or appeal
any claim for any award,  compensation  or  insurance  payment on account of any
Condemnation affecting such Property. The Participants, the Lessor Trust and the
Administrative  Agent shall  consult with the  Construction  Agent in connection
with  the  foregoing,  but  the  Construction  Agent  shall  have  no  right  to

on account of any award,  compensation  or insurance  payment  described in this
Section 3.5 shall be distributed by the Administrative  Agent as follows: (i) if
such  Condemnation   constitutes  a  Significant   Condemnation  and  the  Agent
Certificate  Holders (at the direction of the Required  Participants) shall have
delivered a Partial  Termination  Notice  pursuant to Section 15.1 of the Master
Lease and such  Affected  Property is the subject of an Event of Loss  Purchase,
the  Administrative  Agent shall apply such amounts toward the Purchase Price of
the Affected  Property or pay over such  amounts to the Lessee,  in each case in
accordance with Section 15.2(a) of the Master Lease,  (ii) if such  Condemnation
constitutes a Significant Condemnation and the Agent Certificate Holders (at the
direction  of  the  Required   Participants)  shall  have  delivered  a  Partial
Termination  Notice  pursuant  to  Section  15.1 of the  Master  Lease  and such
Affected Property is the subject of an Event of Loss Return,  the Administrative
Agent shall  distribute  such amounts to the  Participants  in  accordance  with
Section  7.7(b) of the  Participation  Agreement and (iii) if such  Condemnation
does not  constitute a Significant  Condemnation  or if such  Condemnation  does
constitute a Significant  Condemnation but the Agent  Certificate  Holders shall
not have delivered a Partial  Termination Notice pursuant to Section 15.1 of the
Master Lease, then, in either case, the Administrative Agent (as assignee of the
Agent Certificate Holders) shall hold such funds in a segregated account and, so
long as the Construction Agent is diligently  restoring the applicable Property,
disburse  such funds from time to time to the  Construction  Agent to effect the
repair of the applicable  Property;  provided,  however,  that if a Condemnation
occurs  during the Interim  Lease Term with  respect to any Property and a Lease
Event of Default or Construction  Agency  Agreement  Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, such amounts shall be distributed as set forth in Article VII
of the Participation Agreement.

Construction  Costs  shall  be  made  available  to the  Construction  Agent  in
accordance  with the  Funding  Request  relating  thereto  and the  terms of the

               Specifications;  or (iii) the insurance required to be maintained
               pursuant to Section 2.8 shall fail to be in full force and effect
               or shall fail to comply with the requirements of Section 2.8 and,
               with respect to insurance  which has not lapsed,  such failure is
               not cured with 15 days of notice  thereof  from  Lessor  Trust to
               Construction Agent; or

                    (e) the Construction  Agent shall fail to perform or observe
               any covenant or  agreement  (other than any covenant or agreement
               described in clause (a) or (d) above) to be performed or observed
               by it under this  Agreement and such failure shall continue for a
               period of thirty  (30) days after the  earlier of (i) the date on
               which the Construction Agent shall have knowledge of such failure
               and (ii) receipt by the  Construction  Agent of a written  notice
               from the Lessor  Trust or the  Administrative  Agent with respect
               thereto.

     Section  5.2.  Survival.  The  termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant to
Section  5.3 or 5.5  shall in no event  relieve  the  Construction  Agent of its
liabilities and obligations  hereunder which accrued prior to such  termination,
or which arise as a result of such  termination,  all of which shall survive any
such termination.

     Section 5.3.  Remedies;  Remedies  Cumulative.  (a) Upon the occurrence and
continuance of any  Construction  Agency  Agreement Event of Default of the type
described in Section 5.1(c), all Commitments shall  automatically  terminate and
the Lessee shall immediately become obligated to pay the then outstanding amount

Supplemental Rent, without presentment,  demand, protest, notice of acceleration
or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived,  anything
in  this   Agreement   or  any  other   Operative   Document  to  the   contrary
notwithstanding.  After the occurrence and continuance of any other Construction
Agency Agreement Event of Default, the Lessor Trust or the Administrative Agent,
as  applicable  (at the direction of the Required  Participants)  may by written
notice to the Lessee or the  Construction  Agent,  immediately (x) terminate all
Commitments,  (y) terminate  this Agreement (and upon the giving of such notice,
this Agreement shall terminate and all rights of the Construction  Agent and all
obligations  of the Lessor Trust and the Agent  Certificate  Holders  under this

other amounts due and owing by the Lessee and the  Construction  Agent under the
Operative Documents and, upon any such notice of acceleration, the Lessee shall,
subject  to the  limitations  imposed  under  Section  5.4,  immediately  become

     (b) (i) If (x) a Construction  Agency Agreement Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing  under Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(c) or (y) as a result of
the  Construction  Agent's  fraudulent  or illegal acts or fraudulent or illegal
omissions or willful  misconduct,  any other Construction Agency Agreement Event
of Default  shall have occurred and be  continuing,  the Lessor Trust shall have
all rights and remedies available under the Operative Documents (including under
Section 16.2 of the Master Lease) or available at law, equity or otherwise.

               (ii) If a Construction  Agency  Agreement  Event of Default shall
          have  occurred  and be  continuing  under  Section  5.1(b),  5.1(d) or
          5.1(e),  other than as a result of Construction  Agent's fraudulent or
          illegal acts or fraudulent or illegal omissions or willful misconduct,
          the Lessor Trust and  Administrative  Agent shall, at the direction of
          the  Required  Participants,  have the right to require  the Lessee to
          relinquish  all of its right,  title and interest in, to and under the
          applicable Property to the Agent Certificate Holders and to pay to the
          Administrative  Agent (as assignee of the Agent  Certificate  Holders)
          the  Construction  Recourse  Amount  for such  Property  plus the Land
          Shortfall  Amount for such Property (any such event,  a  "Construction
          Return").  Under such  circumstances,  the Lessee shall, in accordance
          with the  procedures  set forth in Section  16.6 of the Master  Lease,
          convey to the Agent  Certificate  Holders all of the  Lessee's  right,
          title and  interest  in, to and under  the  applicable  Property,  and
          deliver  to the  Lessor  Trust  and  each  Agent  Certificate  Holders
          appropriate statements of termination.

     (c) No failure to exercise and no delay in  exercising,  on the part of the
Administrative  Agent or any Participant,  any right, remedy, power or privilege
under this Agreement or under the other  Operative  Documents shall operate as a
waiver thereof,  nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,  remedy,
power or privilege under this Agreement  preclude any other or further  exercise
thereof or the  exercise of any other right,  remedy,  power or  privilege.  The
rights,  remedies,  powers and privileges  provided in this Agreement and in the
other  Operative  Documents  are  cumulative  and not  exclusive  of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

     (d) The  Construction  Agent  shall pay upon demand all  reasonable  costs,
expenses,  losses,  expenditures  and damages  (including,  without  limitation,
attorneys'  fees)  incurred by or on behalf of any  Participant  or any Agent in
connection with any Construction  Agency Agreement Event of Default;  subject to
the limitations of Section 5.4 hereof.

     Section  5.4.  Limitation  on  Construction   Agent's  Recourse  Liability.
Notwithstanding  anything contained herein or in any other Operative Document to
the contrary,  upon the occurrence and during the  continuance of a Construction
Agency  Agreement Event of Default,  including any Lease Event of Default,  with
respect to any Property  described in Section  5.1(b),  5.1(d) or 5.1(e)  (other
than as a result of the  Construction  Agent's  fraudulent  or  illegal  acts or
fraudulent or illegal  omissions or willful  misconduct),  the aggregate maximum
recourse liability of the Construction Agent to the Agent Certificate Holders or
any Person claiming by, through or under the Agent Certificate Holders under the
Operative  Documents,   including  specifically  but  without  limitation,   the
Participants,  with  respect to any damages  which  relate to or arise from such
Construction  Agency  Agreement  Event  of  Default  shall  be  limited  to  the
Construction  Recourse Amount plus the Land Shortfall  Amount for the applicable


                                       13

Property;  provided,  however,  that the foregoing  shall not limit or otherwise
affect the Construction  Agent's obligations under Sections 13.1 and 13.3 of the
Participation  Agreement or the  Construction  Agent's  obligation to return the
applicable Property or Properties in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 16.6 of the Master Lease (and the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise
affect any payments or amounts payable by the Construction Agent with respect to
any damages incurred by the Administrative  Agent or any Participant as a result
of any failure by the Construction Agent to so return the applicable Property or
Properties);  and provided,  further,  that the  Construction  Agent shall fully
indemnify  the  Lessor  Trust for all Liens  (other  than  Lessor  Liens,  those
Permitted  Property Liens in clauses (i), (vii),  (ix) and (x) of the definition
thereof,  and the Liens of the Lessor  Mortgage) on such Property on the date of
such  relinquishment  to the extent such Liens were  caused by the  Construction
Agent and arose from events  unrelated to the  Construction  of such Property in
accordance with this  Construction  Agency  Agreement.  The  Construction  Agent
nonetheless  acknowledges  and agrees that the Agent  Certificate  Holders  (and
Persons  claiming by, through or under the Agent  Certificate  Holders) shall be
entitled  to  recover  from  the  applicable  Property  (including  through  any
reletting  and/or  sale of such  Property  or any  portion  thereof)  the entire
outstanding  Property Cost of such  Property,  all accrued and unpaid  interest,
Yield and other amounts then due and owing to the Agent Certificate Holders, any
other  Participant,  the  Administrative  Agent or any  other  Person  under the
Operative  Documents  and all other costs and expenses of the Agent  Certificate
Holders,  the  other  Participants  and the  Administrative  Agent  incurred  in
connection with such Property (including without limitation,  any costs incurred
in connection with the construction of the Improvements  and/or any reletting or
sale of such  Property or any portion  thereof)  from and after the date of such
return.

     Section 5.5.  Construction  Agent's Right to Purchase.  In the event that a
Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default (other than a Construction Agency
Agreement  Event of Default under  Section  5.1(c)) with respect to any Property
shall have occurred and be continuing,  the Construction  Agent may purchase the
applicable Property for a price equal to the Property Cost of such Property then
outstanding  on the date of such purchase plus all accrued and unpaid Basic Rent
plus  any   Supplemental   Rent  due  and  owing  under  Section  13.10  of  the
Participation  Agreement or any other Section of the Participation  Agreement by
exercising  its Purchase  Option in  accordance  with Section 18.1 of the Master
Lease;  provided that the Construction  Agent shall have given written notice of
its  intention to do so within five (5) days after the  occurrence of such Event
of Default and provided, further, that the Construction Agent shall purchase the
applicable  Property  and pay all amounts  due in  connection  therewith  within
fifteen (15) days after the  occurrence of such  Construction  Agency  Agreement
Event  of  Default.  The  Construction  Agent's  purchase  of  any  Property  in
accordance  with this  Section 5.5 and in  accordance  with  Section 18.1 of the
Master  Lease  shall  be  deemed  to cure  the  applicable  Construction  Agency
Agreement Event of Default to the extent relating to such Property.

     Section  6.1. No  Construction  Agency  Fee.  All  obligations,  duties and

     Section  6.2.  Return  of Excess  Amounts.  (a) If,  in  connection  with a
Construction  Return,  the Lessee and  Construction  Agent pays the Construction
Recourse Amount and, if applicable,  the Land Shortfall  Amount for any Property
and  relinquishes  all of its  interest  in  such  Property,  in  each  case  in
accordance  with  the  provisions  hereof,  and,  at any  time  thereafter,  the

Land Shortfall  Amount or through the sale of such Property to a third party) an
amount  exceeding  the sum of the  following:  (i) the Property  Balance of such
Property on the date of such  determination,  (ii) all  accrued  interest on the
Loans made with  respect to such  Property  and all  accrued  Yield on the Agent

if such date of  determination  occurs  after the  Expiration  Date,  an Imputed
Return on each  Participant's  outstanding  Loans or Agent  Certificate  Holders
Amounts  made  with  respect  to such  Property,  during  the  period  from  the
Expiration  Date to such date of  determination,  (iv) all  costs  and  expenses
(including,  without  limitation,  legal  costs  and  attorneys'  fees)  of  the
Participants  and the  Administrative  Agent  incurred in  connection  with such
Property  (including,  without  limitation,  all costs and expenses  incurred in
connection  with the payment of any  Construction  Costs,  Completion  Costs and
Construction  Termination  Costs relating to such Property,  the construction of
any  Improvements on such Property and any reletting or sale of such Property or
any portion thereof) and (v) all other amounts owing to the Participants and the
Administrative  Agent under the Operative  Documents,  to the extent relating to
such Property or allocable to such Property, then the Administrative Agent shall
pay such excess over to the Construction Agent.

     (b) If any Uncompleted  Property is sold by the  Administrative  Agent to a
third party and, on or prior to such sale,  the  Construction  Agent  engages an
appraiser,  at the Construction  Agent's sole cost and expense,  to appraise the
Appraised  Value  of such  Property,  then,  to the  extent  (if  any)  that the
Appraised Value of the Land portion of such Property exceeds the sum of the Land
Acquisition  Cost therefor and the Imputed Return on such Land  Acquisition Cost
during the period from the  occurrence  of the  applicable  Construction  Agency
Agreement  Event of Default to the date of such sale, the  Administrative  Agent
shall  remit  such  excess  to  the   Construction   Agent  promptly  after  the
Administrative Agent's receipt of proceeds of such sale.

                        CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS ASSIGNMENT

     FOR VALUE  RECEIVED,  and to secure  the  performance  by R.M.E.,  INC.,  a
California  corporation,  of all of its  obligations  under that certain  Master
Lease and Deed of Trust,  dated as of July 14, 2000 (as the same may be amended,
supplemented,  amended and restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"Master Lease"), R.M.E., INC., a California corporation (hereinafter referred to
as either the "Construction Agent" or "Assignor"),  does hereby quitclaim, sell,
assign,  transfer  and set over unto the  Lessor  Trust all of the  Construction
Agent's  right,  title  and  interest  in  and to the  following  to the  extent
assignable   and   transferable   (referred  to   collectively   herein  as  the
"Construction Documents"):

               (i) all construction  contracts or management agreements relating
          to the  Construction  with  respect  to any  Property,  as  each  such
          agreement may hereafter be amended, supplemented, amended and restated
          or  otherwise   modified   from  time  to  time   (collectively,   the
          "Construction Contracts");

               (ii) all  architectural  services  agreements  pertaining  to the
          Construction,  as each such  agreement may hereafter be  supplemented,
          modified or amended from time to time (collectively,  the "Architect's
          Agreements");

               (iii) all plans,  specifications  and  drawings  of any and every
          kind  heretofore or hereafter  prepared for use in connection with the
          Construction of the Property (including, without limitation, the Plans
          and Specifications),  and any supplements, amendments or modifications
          thereto (collectively, the "Plans"); and

               (iv) all building and other  permits,  licenses and  governmental
          approvals  which  are  necessary  or useful  to the  commencement  and
          completion   of  the   Construction,   or  otherwise   relate  to  the
          Construction, heretofore or hereafter obtained or applied for by or on
          behalf of the Assignor or any  architects,  engineers  or  contractors
          working on any aspect of the  Construction,  and any deposits  made in
          connection therewith (collectively, the "Permits");

provided, however, that the Construction Agent does not assign or transfer to
the Lessor Trust any Construction Documents whose terms explicitly prohibit any
such transfer or assignment (and the intention for such prohibition was not to
avoid the assignment and transfer provisions of this Construction Documents
Assignment); provided, further, that the Lessor Trust shall not have any
obligation or liability of any kind under or with respect to the Construction
Documents, either before or after the Lessor Trust's exercise of any rights
hereby granted to it.

         This Construction Documents Assignment shall inure to the benefit of
the Lessor Trust and each of its successors and permitted assigns, and shall be
binding upon the Assignor and its successors and assigns, and shall continue in
full force and effect until all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of any
kind now or hereafter due the Lessor Trust from the Assignor under or with
respect to any of the Operative Documents, or which are otherwise secured
hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising or incurred, have been fully
paid, performed and satisfied, and all Commitments have terminated, at which
time this Construction Documents Assignment will terminate. The Lessor Trust
will not exercise any of its rights hereunder until there shall have occurred
and be continuing a Lease Event of Default.



                                      1-2
<PAGE>

     For  purposes  of  completing  the  Construction  after any Lease  Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing,  the Lessor Trust may, subject to
the terms of the  Operative  Documents  and subject to any  restrictions  in the
Construction  Documents,  further  assign its right,  title and  interest in the
Construction  Documents without the consent of the Assignor or any contractor or
architect.

     This Construction Documents Assignment is a present, perfected and absolute
assignment; provided, however, that the Lessor Trust shall not have the right to
undertake  completion of the  Construction or directly to enforce the provisions
of any Construction Contract or any Architect's Agreement until a Lease Event of
Default  shall have occurred and be  continuing;  and  provided,  further,  that
unless and until a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Construction  Agent shall have the right to retain  exclusive  possession of
the Construction Documents but shall provide the Lessor Trust a photocopy of any
thereof promptly upon request. During the continuance of any such Lease Event of
Default,  the Lessor  Trust may,  without  affecting  any other  right or remedy
available  to  it,  exercise  its  rights  under  this  Construction   Documents
Assignment as provided  herein in any manner  permitted by law. If any notice to
the  Assignor  is  required by law,  such  notice  shall be deemed  commercially
reasonable  if given at least  twenty  (20) days  prior to the date of  intended
action.

     This Construction Documents Assignment may be effectively waived, modified,
amended  or  terminated  only by a written  instrument  executed  by each of the
Lessor Trust and the  Assignor.  Any such waiver  shall be  effective  only with
respect to the specific instance described  therein.  Delay or course of conduct
shall not constitute a waiver of any right or remedy of the Lessor Trust.

     The parties hereto  acknowledge and agree that this Construction  Documents
Assignment is made with the consent of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lenders and in recognition of the fact that the Lessor Trust has prior hereto or
simultaneously  herewith assigned  substantially  all of its respective  rights,
title  and  interest  in and to the  Master  Lease and the  Construction  Agency
Agreement (including this Construction Documents Assignment) in consideration of
the Lenders' making of the Loans.

     Capitalized  terms  used but not  otherwise  defined  in this  Construction
Documents Assignment have the respective meanings specified in Appendix A to the
Participation  Agreement  dated as of the date  hereof  among the Lessee and the
Construction Agent, the Guarantor,  the Lessor Trust, the Lessors,  the Lenders,
the  Administrative  Agent and the Arranger (as such  Appendix A may be amended,
supplemented,  amended and  restated or  otherwise  modified  from time to time,
"Appendix  A");  and the rules of  interpretation  set forth in such  Appendix A
shall apply to this Construction Documents Assignment.

     THIS CONSTRUCTION  DOCUMENTS ASSIGNMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN, AND SHALL IN
ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY AND  CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA  (EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT OF LAW OR CHOICE OF LAW RULES WHICH
MIGHT LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERNAL LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) AS
TO ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE).

                                   DEFINITIONS

     Section 1.1. Definitions.  Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
in this Guaranty  have the  respective  meanings  specified in Appendix A to the

the rules of interpretation set forth therein shall apply to this Guaranty.

     Section 1.2. U.C.C.  Definitions.  Unless  otherwise  defined herein or the
context otherwise requires, terms for which meanings are provided in the Uniform

                               GUARANTY PROVISIONS

     Section 2.1. Guaranties. (a) The Guarantor, as a primary obligor and not as
a surety, hereby absolutely,  unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each
of  the  Guaranteed  Parties  the  following  obligations   (collectively,   the
"Guaranteed Obligations"): (i) the due, punctual and full payment by the Lessee,
whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment,  declaration,  acceleration,
demand or  otherwise,  of all  Obligations  and amounts to be paid by the Lessee
pursuant to any  Operative  Document to which the Lessee is or is to be a party,
whether for  Certificate  Holder  Amounts,  principal,  Yield,  interest,  fees,
expenses or otherwise  (including  all such  amounts  which would become due and
payable by the Lessee but for the operation of the automatic  stay under Section
362(a) of the Bankruptcy  Code, and the operation of Sections  502(b) and 506(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code, or similar  provisions of the Bankruptcy Code); and (ii)
the due,  prompt and faithful  performance  of, and  compliance  with, all other
obligations,  covenants,  terms,  conditions  and  undertakings  of  the  Lessee
contained in each Operative  Document to which the Lessee is or is to be a party
in accordance with the terms thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else to the contrary  contained herein, (y) the Guarantor shall not be obligated
to pay under this  Guaranty  any  amounts  due from the Lessee  under the Master
Lease other than such  amounts as the Lessee will be  obligated to pay under the
Master  Lease  assuming the Master Lease were  enforced in  accordance  with its
terms  (and  without  giving  effect  to any  discharge  or  limitation  thereon
resulting or arising by reason of the  bankruptcy  or  insolvency of the Lessee)
and the  limitations  of Section  16.5 of the Master  Lease  shall  apply to the
Guarantor and (2) during the Interim Lease Term of any Uncompleted  Property the
obligations of the Guarantor hereunder with respect to such Property shall be in
favor of the Lessor Trust solely and shall  include only those  amounts  payable
pursuant to the Construction Agency Agreement.

     (b) The Guarantor  further agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Guaranteed Party for any and all costs and expenses  (including  reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by such Guaranteed Party in enforcing any
rights under this Guaranty.


                                       2
<PAGE>

     (c) This  Guaranty  constitutes  a guaranty of payment  when due and not of
collection, and the Guarantor specifically agrees that it shall not be necessary
or required that any Guaranteed  Party  exercise any right,  assert any claim or
demand or enforce any remedy  whatsoever  against any Lessee or any other Person
before or as a condition to the  enforcement of the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder.

     Section 2.2.  Guaranty  Absolute.  This Guaranty shall in all respects be a
continuing,  absolute,  unconditional and irrevocable  guaranty of payment,  and
shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations have been
paid in full and all obligations of the Guarantor hereunder,  if any, shall have
been paid in full. The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will
be paid strictly in accordance  with the terms of each Operative  Document under
which they arise,  in each case  regardless of (but to the extent  permitted by)
any law,  regulation  or order now or  hereafter  in effect in any  jurisdiction
affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Guaranteed Party. The liability
of the  Guarantor  under this  Guaranty  shall be  absolute,  unconditional  and
irrevocable irrespective of:

               (a) any  lack of  validity,  legality  or  enforceability  of any
          Operative Document;

               (b) the failure of any Guaranteed Party:

                    (i) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
               remedy against the Lessee,  the Agent  Certificate  Holder or any
               Certificate  Holder or any other Person under the  provisions  of
               any Operative Document or otherwise, or

                    (ii) to exercise any right or remedy  against the  Guarantor
               of, or collateral securing, any Guaranteed Obligations;

               (c) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment of, or in
          any other term of, all or any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any
          other  extension,  compromise  or  renewal  of any  of the  Guaranteed
          Obligations;

               (d) any reduction,  limitation,  impairment or termination of the
          Guaranteed Obligations for any reason,  including any claim of waiver,
          release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject
          to (and the  Guarantor  hereby  waives  any  right to or claim of) any
          defense or setoff, counterclaim,  recoupment or termination whatsoever
          by reason of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity,
          compromise,  unenforceability  of,  or any other  event or  occurrence
          affecting, the Guaranteed Obligations or any amendment to, rescission,
          waiver,  or other  modification  of, or any consent to departure from,
          any of the terms of any Operative Document; provided that any party to
          any such amendment or modification  (whether  executing such amendment
          or  modification or bound thereby) shall be bound by such amendment or
          modification;

               (e) any addition,  exchange,  release, surrender or nonperfection
          of any  collateral,  or any  amendment  to or  waiver  or  release  or
          addition of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, held by
          any Guaranteed Party securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations; or


                                       3
<PAGE>

               (f) any other  circumstance  which might  otherwise  constitute a
          legal or  equitable  defense  available  to,  or a legal or  equitable
          discharge of, or set-off  against the Lessee,  the Lessor  Trust,  the
          Owner Trustee,  the Agent Certificate  Holder, any Certificate Holder,
          any surety or any guarantors, other than a defense that the Guaranteed
          Obligations have been theretofore paid in full.

     Section 2.3.  Reinstatement.  The Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty shall
continue to be  effective or be  reinstated,  as the case may be, if at any time
any  payment  (in  whole  or in part) of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  is
rescinded  or must  otherwise  be restored  by any  Guaranteed  Party,  upon the
insolvency,  bankruptcy or reorganization of the Lessee or otherwise,  as though
such payment had not been made.

     Section 2.4. Waiver. (a) The Guarantor hereby waives, to the maximum extent
permitted by Applicable Law, (i) promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and
any other notice (other than those provided for in the Operative Documents) with
respect to any of the Guaranteed  Obligations  and this  Guaranty,  and (ii) any
requirement  that any Guaranteed  Party protect,  secure,  perfect or insure any
security interest or Lien, or any property subject thereto, or exhaust any right
or take any action against the Lessee, the Lessor Trust, the Owner Trustee,  the
Agent Certificate  Holder, any Certificate Holder or any other Person (including
any  other  guarantor  or  entity  or any  collateral  securing  the  Guaranteed
Obligations).

     (b) To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Guarantor waives
the right by statute or otherwise to require the Guaranteed Parties to institute
suit  against  the  Lessee or to  exhaust  any  rights  and  remedies  which the
Guaranteed  Parties  have or may have  against  the Lessee  and agrees  that all
rights and remedies  provided  herein are  cumulative  and not  exclusive of any
other  rights or  remedies  provided  by law and no  failure  to or delay in the
exercise of any right shall  operate as a waiver  thereof.  In this regard,  the
Guarantor  agrees  that it is bound to the  payment  of each and all  Guaranteed
Obligations,  whether now  existing or hereafter  accruing,  as fully as if such
Guaranteed  Obligations  were directly  owing to the  Guaranteed  Parties by the
Guarantor.  The Guarantor  further  waives any defense  arising by reason of any
disability  or other  defense  (other  than  the  defense  that  the  Guaranteed
Obligations shall have been fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid by
the Lessee or the Guarantor,  subject to Section 2.3 hereof) of the Lessee or by
reason  of the  cessation  from any cause  whatsoever  of the  liability  of the
Guaranteed Parties in respect thereof.

     (c)  The  Guarantor  agrees  that  if all or a  portion  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations  are at any time  secured  by a deed of trust or  mortgage  covering
interests in real  property,  the Agent  Certificate  Holder and  Administrative
Agent, in their sole discretion,  without notice or demand and without affecting
the liability of the Guarantor  under this Guaranty,  may foreclose  pursuant to
the terms of the  Master  Lease and the deed of trust or  mortgage  or  security
agreement  contained  therein and the interests in real property secured thereby
by non-judicial  sale. The Guarantor  understands that the exercise by the Agent
Certificate  Holder  and  Administrative  Agent of certain  rights and  remedies
contained in the Master  Lease and any such deed of trust,  mortgage or security
against  provisions  contained  therein may affect or eliminate the  Guarantor's
right of subrogation  against the Lessee and the Guarantor may therefore incur a


                                       4
<PAGE>

partially or totally  non-reimbursable  liability hereunder.  Nevertheless,  the
Guarantor  hereby  authorizes  and  empowers  the Agent  Certificate  Holder and
Administrative  Agent to  exercise,  in their  sole  discretion,  any rights and
remedies, or any combination thereof,  which may then be available,  since it is
the intent and purpose of the Guarantor that the obligations  hereunder shall be
absolute,  independent  and  unconditional  under  any  and  all  circumstances.
Notwithstanding  any foreclosure of the lien of the Master Lease and any deed of
trust,  mortgage or security agreement  contained therein with respect to any or
all of any real or personal property secured thereby, whether by the exercise of
the power of sale contained therein, by an action for judicial foreclosure or by
an acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Guarantor shall remain bound
under this Guaranty  including its obligation to pay any Guaranteed  Obligations
not theretofore paid.

     (d) Until the Guaranteed  Obligations  shall have been indefeasibly paid in
full and completely performed,  the Lease Balance shall have been fully paid and
the Operative  Documents  shall have  terminated,  the Guarantor  shall withhold
exercise  of (a) any  claim,  right or  remedy,  direct  or  indirect,  that the
Guarantor now has or may hereafter  have against the Lessee or any of its assets
in  connection  with this  Guaranty or the  performance  by the Guarantor of its
obligations  hereunder,  in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises
in equity,  under  contract,  by  statute,  under  common law or  otherwise  and
including  without  limitation (i) any right of  subrogation,  reimbursement  or
indemnification  that the Guarantor  now has or may  hereafter  have against the
Lessee,  (ii) any right to enforce,  or to participate  in, any claim,  right or
remedy that the  Guaranteed  Parties now have or may hereafter  have against the
Lessee, and (iii) any benefit of, any right to participate in, any collateral or
security now or hereafter  held by Agent  Certificate  Holder or  Administrative
Agent,  and (b) any right of  contribution  the  Guarantor  may have against any
other  guarantor of the  Guaranteed  Obligations.  The Guarantor  further agrees
that,  to the extent the  agreement  to withhold  the  exercise of its rights of
subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein
is found by a court of  competent  jurisdiction  to be void or voidable  for any
reason,  any  rights  of  subrogation,   reimbursement  or  indemnification  the
Guarantor may have against the Lessee or against any collateral or security, and
any  rights of  contribution  the  Guarantor  may have  against  any such  other
guarantor,  shall be junior  and  subordinate  to any rights  Agent  Certificate
Holder or Administrative Agent may have against such Lessee, to all right, title
and interest, that the Agent Certificate Holder or Administrative Agent may have
in any such collateral or security,  and to any right that the Agent Certificate
Holder or  Administrative  Agent may have  against such other  guarantor.  Agent
Certificate Holder or Administrative  Agent may use, sell or dispose of any item
of  collateral  or  security as it sees fit  without  regard to any  subrogation
rights that the Guarantor may have, and upon any such disposition or sale of any
rights of subrogation  the Guarantor may have shall  terminate in respect of any
such  item  of  collateral  or  security.  If any  amount  shall  be paid to the
Guarantor on account of any such subrogation,  reimbursement or  indemnification
rights  at any time  when all the  Guaranteed  Obligations  shall  not have been
indefeasibly paid in full or completely performed,  such amount shall be held in
trust for Agent Certificate  Holder or Administrative  Agent and shall forthwith
be paid over to Agent Certificate Holder or Administrative Agent for the benefit
of the  Guaranteed  Parties to be credited  and applied  against the  Guaranteed
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.

     Section 2.5. Guarantor  Benefits.  The Guarantor  acknowledges that it will
receive benefits from the financing and other  arrangements  contemplated by the
Operative  Documents  and that the  waivers  and  agreements  set  forth in this
Guaranty are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

     Section 2.6. Consent to Jurisdiction;  Waiver of Immunities.  The Guarantor
hereby  acknowledges and agrees that it irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction  of the United States  District Court for the Northern  District of
California for the adjudication of any matter arising out of or relating to this
Guaranty.  The Guarantor hereby waives any objection to any action or proceeding
in the United States  District Court for the Northern  District of California on
the grounds of venue or any claim that such court is an inconvenient  forum. The
Guarantor  agrees  that a final,  unappealable  judgment  in any such  action or
proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by
suit on the  judgment or in any other  manner  provided by law.  Nothing in this
Section  shall affect the right of any  Guaranteed  Party to bring any action or
proceeding  against  the  Guarantor  or its  property in the courts of any other
jurisdictions.

     Section 2.7. Bankruptcy. In the event of a rejection of the Master Lease in
a bankruptcy or insolvency  proceeding of the Lessee,  the Guarantor agrees that
it will pay forthwith all payments  required to be made by such Lessee under the
Master Lease as though such rejection had not occurred.

     Section 2.8. Payments.  All payments to be made by the Guarantor  hereunder
shall  be  made  to the  Administrative  Agent  in  Dollars  to the  Account  in
immediately available and freely transferable funds at the place of payment, all
such payments to be paid without  setoff,  counterclaim or reduction and without
deduction  for,  and free from,  any and all  present or future  taxes,  levies,
imposts,  duties,  fees,  charges,  deductions,  withholding or liabilities with
respect  thereto  or  any  restrictions  or  conditions  of any  nature.  If the
Guarantor is required by law to make any deduction or  withholding on account of
any tax or other  withholding or deduction from any sum payable by the Guarantor
hereunder,  the  Guarantor  shall  pay any  such  tax or  other  withholding  or
deduction and shall pay such additional  amount  necessary to ensure that, after
making any payment, deduction or withholding, the Administrative Agent and Agent
Certificate Holder shall receive and retain (free of any liability in respect of
any  payment,  deduction or  withholding)  a net sum equal to what it would have
received and so retained hereunder had no such deduction, withholding or payment
been  required to have been made;  provided  that any tax on net income or other
tax that any  Guaranteed  Party would have been required to pay had such amounts
been received in accordance with the terms of the Operative  Documents shall not
be taken into account in calculating any amount pursuant to this Section 2.8.

                                 LOAN AGREEMENT


     THIS LOAN  AGREEMENT  dated as of July 14,  2000 (this  "Loan  Agreement"),
among LODI 2000  DISTRIBUTION  Trust, a grantor trust (the "Lessor Trust"),  the
various  financial  institutions  as are or may from time to time become parties
hereto as lenders hereunder (each a "Lender" and collectively the "Lenders") and
HARRIS  TRUST AND  SAVINGS  BANK as  Administrative  Agent (the  "Administrative
Agent") for the Lenders.

                    AMOUNT AND TERMS OF LENDERS' COMMITMENTS

     Section 2.1. Loan  Commitments.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
and of the Participation  Agreement,  each Lender severally agrees to make loans
(the "Loans") to the Lessor Trust from time to time during the Commitment Period
for the  purpose  of  enabling  the  Lessor  Trust to  acquire  or obtain fee or
leasehold  interests  in the  Property  and to pay Land  Acquisition  Costs  and
Property  Improvement Costs, in an aggregate  principal amount not to exceed the
amount of such Lender's Commitment. Any amounts prepaid may not be readvanced.

     Section 2.2.  Notes.  The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by a
promissory  note of the Lessor Trust on behalf of the Agent  Certificate  Holder
and the Certificate Holders, substantially in the form of Exhibit A to this Loan
Agreement (each, a "Note"),  with appropriate  insertions as to payee,  date and
principal amount,  payable to the order of such Lender and in a principal amount
equal to the initial Commitment of such Lender. Each Lender is hereby authorized
to  record  the  date  and  amount  of  each  Loan  made by  such  Lender,  each
continuation  thereof,  the date and  amount of each  payment or  prepayment  of
principal  thereof and the length of each Interest Period with respect  thereto,
on the schedule  annexed to and  constituting  a part of its Note,  and any such
recordation  shall  constitute  prima  facie  evidence  of the  accuracy  of the
information so recorded;  provided that the failure to make any such recordation
or any error in such recordation shall not affect the Lessor Trust's,  the Agent
Certificate Holder's or any other Certificate Holder's obligations  hereunder or
under such Note.  Each Note shall (i) be dated the  Documentation  Date, (ii) be
stated to mature on the  Maturity  Date and (iii)  provide  for the  payment  of
principal (if applicable) and interest in accordance with this Loan Agreement.

     Section 2.3.  Prepayments.  Prepayments  made by the Lessor Trust hereunder
shall be made in  accordance  with,  and  shall be  subject  to,  the  terms and
conditions of Section 4.3 of the Participation Agreement.

     Section 2.4.  Interest  Rates and Payment  Dates.  (a) Each Loan shall bear
interest from the date each respective  Advance is made at a rate (the "Interest
Rate") equal to (i) with respect to Loans that are Eurodollar  Loans/Certificate
Holder Amounts, a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted  Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Loan Margin or (ii) with respect to Loans that are Base
Rate Loans/Certificate  Holder Amounts, a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate.
The  Administrative  Agent shall, as soon as practicable,  but in no event later
than  12:00  p.m.  (noon)  (Chicago  time),  two (2)  Business  Days  before the
effectiveness  of each  Base  Rate or  Adjusted  Eurodollar  Rate,  cause  to be
determined such Base Rate or Adjusted  Eurodollar  Rate, the resulting  Interest
Rate and Lender Basic Rent, and notify each Lender thereof.



                                       2
<PAGE>

     (b) If all or a portion of (i) the principal  amount of any Loan,  (ii) any
interest payable thereon,  or (iii) any other amount payable hereunder shall not
be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise),
such overdue  amount  shall bear  interest at a rate per annum which is equal to
the Overdue Rate. Interest accruing pursuant to this clause (b) shall be payable
from time to time on demand.  Upon the occurrence and during the  continuance of
an Event of  Default,  the  principal  of and, to the extent  permitted  by law,
interest on the Loans and any other amounts  owing  hereunder or under the other
Operative Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the Overdue Rate.

     (c) During the Interim Lease Term for any Property, interest on outstanding
Loans made with  respect to such  Property  shall be paid from  Advances  deemed
requested by the Lessee pursuant to Section 3.4 of the  Participation  Agreement
on each Scheduled  Payment Date occurring prior to the earlier of the Completion
Date  and the  Outside  Completion  Date  for such  Property,  and the  Property
Improvement  Costs of such Property  shall be increased on the date of each such
Advance  by an  amount  equal to such  Advance;  provided  that if a  Completion
Certificate  is delivered less than three (3) Business Days prior to a Scheduled
Payment Date, solely for purposes of this clause (c) such Completion Certificate
shall not be effective until the day after such Scheduled Payment Date.

     (d) During the Basic Lease Term for any Property,  interest on  outstanding
Loans made with  respect to such  Property  shall be due and  payable in cash on
each Scheduled  Payment Date and not funded  pursuant to the deemed  Advances as
referred to in clause (c) above.

     (e) Each  prepayment of the Loans shall be accompanied by accrued  interest
to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid.

     Section 2.5.  Repayment  of Loans.  (a) During the Basic Lease Term and any
Renewal Term,  the  Certificate  Holders  acting  through the Agent  Certificate
Holder  shall  cause the Lessor  Trust to repay the Loans  with  respect to each
respective  Property on any date on which the Property Balance for such Property
is due from the Lessee under the Lease.

     (b) If not  repaid  sooner,  all  Loans  shall  be due and  payable  on the
Maturity Date.

     Section 2.6. Computation of Interest. (a) If interest on the Loans shall be
based on the Adjusted  Eurodollar Rate, then it shall be calculated on the basis
of a 360-day  year and, if based on the Base Rate,  then on a 360-day year basis
if the Base Rate is  calculated  at the Federal  Funds  Rate,  and a 365- or, if
applicable,  366-,  day year basis if the Base Rate is  calculated  at the Prime
Rate, in each case for the actual days elapsed.  The Administrative  Agent shall
as soon as practicable  notify the Agent Certificate  Holder, the Lessee and the
Lenders of each  determination of a London Interbank Offered Rate. Any change in
the  Interest  Rate on a Loan  resulting  from a change  in the Base Rate or the
Eurodollar  Reserve  Percentage  shall  become  effective  as of the  opening of
business on the day on which such change becomes  effective.  The Administrative
Agent shall as soon as  practicable  notify the Agent  Certificate  Holder,  the
Lessee and the Lenders of the effective  date and the amount of each such change
in Interest Rate.

     (b) Each  determination  of an interest  rate by the  Administrative  Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Loan  Agreement  shall be binding on the Agent
Certificate  Holder, the Lessor Trust, each Certificate Holder, each Lender, the
Lessee and the Guarantor in the absence of manifest error.

     Section 2.7.  Extension of Maturity Date. The Maturity Date may be extended
in accordance with the Section 11.1 of the Participation Agreement.

     Section 2.8.  Procedures  for Advances.  (a) With respect to the funding of
the Loans for any  Advance,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall give each  Lender
prompt  written  notice of (i) receipt of the Funding  Request  delivered by the
Lessee in connection  with the proposed  Advance and the contents  thereof,  and
(ii) each Lender's share of the Loans comprising such Advance. Subject to timely
delivery  of a  Funding  Request  and the  other  terms  and  conditions  of the
Operative  Documents,  each Lender shall make its  Commitment  Percentage of the
requested  Advance  available to the  Administrative  Agent by 12:00 p.m. (noon)
(Chicago time), on the requested  Acquisition Date or requested Funding Date, as
applicable.

     (b) Unless the Administrative  Agent shall have been notified in writing by
any Lender  prior to such  Advance  that a Lender  will not make the amount that
would  constitute  its  Commitment  Percentage of such Advance  available to the
Administrative  Agent, the  Administrative  Agent may assume that such Lender is
making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent  may,  in  reliance  upon such  assumption,  make  available  to the Agent
Certificate Holder a corresponding  amount. If such amount is not made available
to the  Administrative  Agent by the  required  time on the Funding  Date or the
Acquisition Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on
demand,  such amount with interest  thereon at a rate equal to the Federal Funds
Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to
the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to
any Lender  with  respect  to any  amounts  owing  under  this  clause  shall be
conclusive  in the  absence  of  manifest  error.  If such  Lender's  Commitment
Percentage of such borrowing is not made available to the  Administrative  Agent
by  such  Lender  within  two  Business  Days  of  such   borrowing   date,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall  notify the Lessee of the failure of such Lender to
make such amount available to the  Administrative  Agent and the  Administrative
Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the
rate per annum equal to the one-half of one percent plus the Federal Funds Rate,
on demand, from the Lessee.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     Section 8.1. Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Harris
Trust  and  Savings  Bank  as   administrative   agent  (in  such   capacity  as
administrative agent hereunder,  the "Administrative  Agent" and for purposes of
this Section 8, the term  "Administrative  Agent" shall include Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in its capacity as  collateral  agent with respect to the Operative
Documents)  of such Lender to act as  specified  herein and the other  Operative
Documents,  and each such Lender hereby authorizes the  Administrative  Agent as
the  agent  for such  Lender,  to take  such  action  on its  behalf  under  the
provisions  of this Loan  Agreement  and the other  Operative  Documents  and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are  expressly  delegated by the
terms  hereof and of the other  Operative  Documents,  together  with such other
powers as are reasonably  incidental  thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to
the  contrary  elsewhere  herein  and  in the  other  Operative  Documents,  the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those


                                       9
<PAGE>

expressly set forth herein and therein,  or any fiduciary  relationship with any
Lender,  and  no  implied  covenants,   functions,   responsibilities,   duties,
obligations or liabilities  shall be read into this Loan Agreement or any of the
other Operative  Documents,  or shall otherwise exist against the Administrative
Agent.  The  provisions  of this  Section  are  solely  for the  benefit  of the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders and no other  Person shall have any rights
as a third  party  beneficiary  of the  provisions  hereof.  In  performing  its
functions  and  duties  under  this  Loan  Agreement  and  the  other  Operative
Documents, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of the Lenders and
does not  assume  and  shall not be deemed to have  assumed  any  obligation  or
relationship of agency or trust with or for the Lessor Trust, the Owner Trustee,
the Lessee, the Agent Certificate  Holder, the Certificate  Holders or any other
Person.

     Section 8.2. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties  hereunder  or under the other  Operative  Documents by or through
agents  or  attorneys-in-fact  and  shall  be  entitled  to  advice  of  counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall
not  be  responsible   for  the  negligence  or  misconduct  of  any  agents  or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

     Section 8.3. Exculpatory  Provisions.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any  of  its  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,   attorneys-in-fact  or
affiliates  shall be (i) liable for any action  lawfully  taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection herewith or in connection with
any of the other Operative  Documents (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful  misconduct),  or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the  Lenders  for  any  recitals,  statements,   representations  or  warranties
contained  herein  or in  any  of  the  other  Operative  Documents  or  in  any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the  Administrative  Agent under or in connection  herewith or in
connection with the other Operative Documents,  or enforceability or sufficiency
of any of the other  Operative  Documents,  or for any failure of any party (not
including the  Administrative  Agent) to any  Operative  Document to perform its
obligations  hereunder  or  thereunder.  The  Administrative  Agent shall not be
responsible  to  any  Lender  for  the  effectiveness,   genuineness,  validity,
enforceability,  collectability or sufficiency of this Loan Agreement, or any of
the other Operative Documents or for any representations,  warranties,  recitals
or  statements  made herein or therein or made by the Lessee,  the Lessor Trust,
the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Holders in any written or oral statement or
in any financial or other statements,  instruments, reports, certificates or any
other  documents in  connection  herewith or therewith  furnished or made by the
Administrative Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf of the Lessee, the Lessor
Trust, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Holders to the Administrative  Agent
or any Lender or be required to  ascertain or inquire as to the  performance  or
observance of any of the terms, conditions,  provisions, covenants or agreements
contained  herein or therein or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or of
the  existence  or possible  existence  of any Default or Event of Default or to
inspect the properties,  books or records of the Lessee, the Lessor Trust or the
Certificate Holders.

     Section 8.4. Reliance on Communications.  The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled  to rely,  and  shall be fully  protected  in  relying,  upon any note,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,


                                       10
<PAGE>

telegram,  telecopy,  telex  or  teletype  message,  statement,  order  or other
document  or  conversation  believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been  signed,  sent or made by the proper  Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements  of legal  counsel  (including,  without  limitation,  counsel to the
Lessee),   independent   accountants   and  other   experts   selected   by  the
Administrative Agent with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent may deem and
treat the Lenders as the owner of their respective  interests  hereunder for all
purposes unless a written notice of assignment,  negotiation or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the  Administrative  Agent in accordance with Section
12.1 of the Participation  Agreement.  The Administrative  Agent,  acting in its
capacity  as  Administrative  Agent,  shall be fully  justified  in  failing  or
refusing to take any action under this Loan  Agreement or under any of the other
Operative  Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
Lenders holding a majority in principal  amount of the  outstanding  Loans as it
deems  appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its  satisfaction  by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully  protected in acting,  or in refraining from acting,
hereunder or under any of the other  Operative  Documents in  accordance  with a
request of Lenders  holding a majority in  principal  amount of the  outstanding
Loans and such request,  and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all the Lenders (including their successors and assigns).

     Section  8.5.  Notice of  Default.  The  Administrative  Agent shall not be
deemed to have  knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default  hereunder  unless the  Administrative  Agent has received notice from a
Lender or the  Lessee  referring  to the  Operative  Document,  describing  such
Default  or Event of  Default  and  stating  that such  notice  is a "notice  of
default." In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the
Administrative  Agent  shall give  prompt  notice  thereof to the  Lenders.  The
Administrative  Agent  shall take such action  with  respect to such  Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by Required Lenders.

     Section 8.6.  Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each
Lender expressly  acknowledges that neither the Administrative  Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents,  attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has
made  any   representations  or  warranties  to  it  and  that  no  act  by  the
Administrative  Agent or any affiliate  thereof  hereafter taken,  including any
review of the affairs of the Lessee,  the Lessor Trust,  the Owner Trustee,  the
Agent  Certificate  Holder  or  the  Certificate  Holders  shall  be  deemed  to
constitute any  representation  or warranty by the  Administrative  Agent to any
Lender.  Each  Lender  represents  to the  Administrative  Agent  that  it  has,
independently  and without reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent or any other
Lender,   and  based  on  such  documents  and  information  as  it  has  deemed
appropriate,  made its own  appraisal of and  investigation  into the  business,
assets,  operations,  property,  financial and other  conditions,  prospects and
creditworthiness  of the Lessee, the Lessor Trust, the Owner Trustee,  the Agent
Certificate Holder and the Certificate Holders and made its own decision to make
its Loans  hereunder  and  enter  into this Loan  Agreement.  Each  Lender  also
represents  that  it  will,   independently   and  without   reliance  upon  the
Administrative  Agent or any  other  Lender,  and  based on such  documents  and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit  analysis,  appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under


                                       11
<PAGE>

this Loan  Agreement,  and to make such  investigation  as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business,  assets, operations,  property,  financial and
other  conditions,  prospects  and  creditworthiness  of the Lessee,  the Lessor
Trust,  the Owner  Trustee,  the Agent  Certificate  Holder and the  Certificate
Holders.  Except for notices,  reports and other documents expressly required to
be  furnished  to  the  Lenders  by  the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder,  the
Administrative  Agent shall not have any duty or  responsibility  to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations,
assets, property,  financial or other conditions,  prospects or creditworthiness
of the Lessee, the Lessor Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Agent Certificate Holder
or  the  Certificate   Holders  which  may  come  into  the  possession  of  the
Administrative  Agent  or any of its  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

     Section  8.7.   Indemnification.   The  Lenders   agree  to  indemnify  the
Administrative  Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not  reimbursed  by
the Lessee,  the Lessor Trust, the Agent  Certificate  Holder or the Certificate
Holders and without  limiting the obligation of such Persons to do so),  ratably
according  to  their  respective  Commitments,  from  and  against  any  and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses or  disbursements  of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including  without  limitation  at  any  time  following  the  payment  of  the
Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted  against the  Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of this Loan
Agreement or the other Operative  Documents or any documents  contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or  any  action  taken  or  omitted  by the  Administrative  Agent  under  or in
connection  with any of the  foregoing;  provided that no Lender shall be liable
for the  payment  of any  portion  of  such  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,
damages, penalties,  actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the gross negligence or willful  misconduct of the Administrative
Agent. If any indemnity  furnished to the  Administrative  Agent for any purpose
shall,  in the opinion of the  Administrative  Agent,  be insufficient or become
impaired,  the Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease,
or not  commence,  to do the acts  indemnified  against  until  such  additional
indemnity is furnished. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment
in full of the Obligations and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the
other Operative Documents.

     Section  8.8.   Administrative  Agent  in  its  Individual  Capacity.   The
Administrative  Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Lessee, the Owner Trustee,
the Agent  Certificate  Holder and any of the Certificate  Holders as though the
Administrative  Agent were not Administrative  Agent hereunder.  With respect to
the Loans made and all Obligations owing to it, the  Administrative  Agent shall
have the same rights and powers under this Loan  Agreement as any Lender and may
exercise  the same as though  it were not  Administrative  Agent,  and the terms
"Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative  Agent in its individual
capacity.

     Section 8.9. Successor  Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may,
at any time,  resign upon 20 days' written notice to the Lenders and the Lessee,
and be removed with cause by Required  Lenders upon 30 days'  written  notice to
the  Administrative  Agent.  Upon any such resignation or removal,  the Required


                                       12
<PAGE>

Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor  Administrative Agent. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by such Lenders, and
shall  have  accepted  such  appointment,  within 30 days  after  the  notice of
resignation   or  notice  of  removal,   as   appropriate,   then  the  retiring
Administrative Agent shall select a successor Administrative Agent provided such
successor is a Lender hereunder or a commercial bank organized under the laws of
the United States of America or of any State thereof and has a combined  capital
and surplus of at least $100,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative  Agent  hereunder by a successor,  such successor  Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the retiring  Administrative  Agent,  and the retiring
Administrative  Agent shall be  discharged  from its duties and  obligations  as
Administrative   Agent  under  this  Loan  Agreement  and  the  other  Operative
Documents.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the provisions of this Article VIII
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Administrative Agent under this Loan Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE IX

delay in exercising,  on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any

shall operate as a waiver thereof;  nor shall any single or partial  exercise of
any right,  remedy,  power or privilege  hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights,  remedies,  powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

     Section   9.4.   Survival   of   Representations   and   Warranties.    All
representations  and warranties made hereunder,  in the other Loan Documents and

be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without

for the breach of performance of any of the covenants contained herein or in any
other  Operative  Document  or for any other  claim  arising in any way from the

Agent nor the Lenders  shall have any recourse  against the Owner  Trustee,  the
