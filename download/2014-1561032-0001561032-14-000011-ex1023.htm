or (iii) constituting purchase money indebtedness, conditional sales contracts, title retention debt instruments or other similar
instruments, upon which interest charges are customarily paid or that are issued or assumed as full or partial payment for property
or services rendered; (c) obligations of such Person as a lessee or obligor under a Capitalized Lease; (d) all reimbursement obligations
of such Person under any letters of credit or acceptances (whether or not the same have been presented for payment); (e) all Off-Balance

recourse to such Person (except for guaranties of customary exceptions for fraud, misapplication of funds, environmental indemnities,
violation of &ldquo;special purpose entity&rdquo; covenants, and other similar exceptions to recourse liability until a written
claim is made with respect thereto, and then shall be included as Indebtedness only to the extent of the anticipated liability
under such claim determined in accordance with GAAP (or prior to any determination by REIT&rsquo;s independent auditors of such

Lien on property or assets owned by such Person, even though such Person has not assumed or become liable for the payment of such
Indebtedness or other payment obligation; and (j) such Person&rsquo;s pro rata share of the Indebtedness (based upon its Equity
Percentage) of any Unconsolidated Affiliate of such Person. &ldquo;Indebtedness&rdquo; shall be adjusted to remove any impact of

or portion thereof, is recourse to such Person, in which case the greater of such Person&rsquo;s pro rata portion of such Indebtedness
or the amount of the recourse portion of the Indebtedness, shall be included as Indebtedness of such Person).</P>

In the event a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against the Borrower or any Guarantor with respect
to the Obligations, the Agent shall have the sole and exclusive right to file and pursue a joint proof claim on behalf of all Lenders.
Any votes with respect to such claims or otherwise with respect to such proceedings shall be subject to the vote of the Majority
Lenders, Required Lenders or all of the Lenders as required by this Agreement. Each Lender irrevocably waives its right to file
or pursue a separate proof of claim in any such proceedings unless the Agent fails to file such claim within thirty (30) days after
receipt of written notice from the Lenders requesting that the Agent file such proof of claim.</P>

certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet
website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by
an Authorized Officer. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have
been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition
hereunder to the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of
a Lender, the Agent (or Issuing Lender, as applicable) may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the
Agent (or Issuing Lender, as applicable) shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such
Loan or issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower and/or
the Guarantors), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.</P>

If consent is required for some action under this Agreement, or except as otherwise provided herein an approval of the Lenders,
the Majority Lenders or the Required Lenders is required or permitted under this Agreement, each Lender agrees to give the Agent,

related thereto (or such lesser period of time required by the terms of the Loan Documents), notice in writing of approval or disapproval
(collectively, &ldquo;<U>Directions</U>&rdquo;) in respect of any action requested or proposed in writing pursuant to the terms

Agent describe the actions that would be acceptable to such Lender. If consent is required for the requested action, any Lender&rsquo;s
failure to respond to a request for Directions within the required time period shall be deemed to constitute a Direction to take
such requested action. In the event that any recommendation is not approved by the requisite number of Lenders and a subsequent
approval on the same subject matter is requested by the Agent, then for the purposes of this paragraph each Lender shall be required
to respond to a request for Directions within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such request. The Agent and each Lender shall

at any time owing by the Agent to or for the credit of or the account of Assignor against any and all of the Secured Obligations,
irrespective of whether or not the Agent shall have made any demand for payment and although such Secured Obligations may be unmatured.
Any notice required by law, including, but not limited to, notice of the intended disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral,
shall be reasonable and properly given if given in the manner prescribed for the giving of notice herein, and, in the case of any
notice of disposition, if given at least ten (10) days prior to such disposition. The Agent may require Assignor to assemble the
Collateral and make it available to the Agent at any place to be designated by the Agent which is reasonably convenient to both
parties. It is expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to dispose of the Collateral at any public or private
sale or sales, without recourse to judicial proceedings and without either demand, appraisement, advertisement or notice (except
as such notice as is otherwise required under this Assignment) of any kind, all of which are expressly waived, and that the Agent
shall be entitled to bid and purchase at any such sale. In the event that the Agent is the successful bidder at any public or private
sale of any note or other document or instrument evidencing Assignor&rsquo;s right to receive a Distribution, the Agent shall be
entitled to credit the amount bid by the Agent against the obligations evidenced by such note, document or instrument rather than
the Secured Obligations. In the event that the Agent is the successful bidder at any public or private sale of the Collateral or
any portion thereof, the amount bid by the Agent may be credited against the Secured Obligations as provided in the Credit Agreement.
To the extent the Collateral consists of marketable securities, the Agent shall not be obligated to sell such securities for the
highest price obtainable, but shall sell them at the market price available on the date of sale. The Agent shall not be obligated
to make any sale of the Collateral if it shall determine not to do so regardless of the fact that notice of sale of the Collateral
may have been given. The Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public sale from time to time by announcement at
the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was
so adjourned. Each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral sold absolutely free from claim or right on the part
of Assignor. In the event that any consent, approval or authorization of any governmental agency or commission will be necessary
to effectuate any such sale or sales, Assignor shall execute all such applications or other instruments as the Agent may deem reasonably
necessary to obtain such consent, approval or authorization. The Agent may notify any account debtor or obligor with respect to
the Collateral to make payment directly to the Agent, and may demand, collect, receipt for, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for,

strictly limit the course of conduct of the Agent if the Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Collateral
in accordance with the terms hereof, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee
of any Collateral could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Agent
in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms hereof under applicable Blue Sky or other
state securities laws or similar Applicable Law analogous in purpose or effect. Assignor recognizes that in light of the foregoing
restrictions and limitations the Agent may, with respect to any sale of the Collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will
agree, among other things, to acquire such Collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution
or resale thereof and who are able to satisfy any conditions or requirements set forth in the Organizational Agreements of the
Companies and the Agent may sell the Collateral in parcels and at such times and to such Persons as the Agent may reasonably determine
is necessary to comply with such conditions or requirements. Assignor acknowledges and agrees that in light of the foregoing restrictions
and limitations, the Agent in its sole and absolute discretion may, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Organizational Agreements
of the Companies, (a) proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Collateral
or part thereof shall have been filed under the Securities Laws (b) approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to
effect such sale and (c) sell the Collateral in parcels and at such times and in such manner to such Persons as the Agent may reasonably
determine is necessary to comply with such conditions and requirements. Assignor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might
result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the
event of any such sale, the Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Collateral in accordance
with the terms hereof at a price that the Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the
circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred
until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached or if all the Collateral were sold at
a single sale. Assignor further agrees that any sale or sales by the Agent of the Collateral made as provided in this Section 16
shall be commercially reasonable. The provisions of this Section 16 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private
market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Agent sells. The Agent and the
Lenders shall not be liable to Assignor for any loss in value of the Collateral by reason of any delay in the sale of the Collateral.</P>
