assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Article&nbsp;9 Collateral by the applicable Grantors to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise,

for trespass to enter any premises where the Article&nbsp;9 Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Article&nbsp;9 Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under
the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale or at any broker&#146;s board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate. The
Administrative Agent shall be authorized at any such sale of securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their
own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the
Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any sale of Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of

to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall
determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time
to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for
future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or
purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this
Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent
permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured
Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be
treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact
that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement, all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the
Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to
a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section&nbsp;9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent

that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a)&nbsp;may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged
Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws and (b)&nbsp;may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in
prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the event of any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the
Pledged Collateral at a price that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized
if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;5.04 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the

any Subsidiary at a public sale, it will, at any time and from time to time (to the extent doing so would be commercially reasonable at the applicable time), upon the reasonable written request of the Administrative Agent, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take or to cause the issuer of such Pledged Collateral to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents, as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Administrative Agent to
permit the public sale of such Pledged Collateral. Each Grantor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, each other Secured Party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors, affiliates and
controlling persons from and against all loss, liability, expenses, costs of counsel (including reasonable fees and expenses to the Administrative Agent of legal counsel), and claims (including the costs of investigation) that they may incur insofar
as such loss, liability, expense or claim arises out of or is based upon any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or arises out
of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue statement or omission
based upon information furnished in writing to such Grantor or the issuer of such Pledged Collateral by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party expressly for use therein. Each Grantor further agrees, upon such written request referred to
above, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause the issuer of such Pledged Collateral to qualify, file or register, any of the Pledged Collateral under the Blue Sky or other securities laws of such states as
may be requested by the Administrative Agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective, all such qualifications, filings or registrations. Each Grantor will bear all costs and expenses of carrying out its obligations under this
