     Section 1.02 Terms Generally. The definitions in Section 1.01 shall apply
equally to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the
context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine and neuter forms. The words "include", "includes" and "including" shall
be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation". All references
herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be deemed references
to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement
unless the context shall otherwise require. Unless otherwise expressly provided
herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be
interpreted in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; provided,
however, that, for purposes of (a) making any calculation contemplated by the
provisions of Article II and (b) determining compliance with any covenant set
forth in Article VI, such terms shall be construed in accordance with GAAP as in
effect on the date of this Agreement applied on a basis consistent with the
application used in preparing the Audited Financial Statements. Unless otherwise
expressly required herein, all calculations with respect to the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be made exclusive of any assets, liabilities,
income or losses of any Unrestricted Subsidiary. As used herein, the "knowledge"
of the Borrower includes the knowledge of each and every Loan Party. Unless
otherwise expressly provided herein, the word "day" means a calendar day.

     Section 1.03 Types of Borrowings. The term "Borrowing" refers to the
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Loans of any Class outstanding
hereunder which bears interest of a specific Type and for a specific Interest
Period pursuant to a notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender's
ratable share of each Borrowing is referred to herein as a separate

<PAGE>

                                                                              33

"Loan". Borrowings, Loans, Letters of Credit and certain related terms hereunder
may be distinguished by "Class" and by "Type". The "Class" of a Loan or of a
Commitment to make such a Loan or of a Borrowing comprising such Loans or of a
Letter of Credit refers to whether such Loan is a Revolving Loan or a Term Loan,
each of which constitutes a Class. The "Type" of a Loan refers to whether such
Loan is an ABR Loan or a Eurodollar Loan. Borrowings and Loans may (but need
not) be identified both by Class and Type (e.g., a "Eurodollar Revolving Loan"
is a Loan which is both a Revolving Loan and a Eurodollar Loan).

                                   ARTICLE II

                                  THE CREDITS

     Section 2.01 Commitment to Make Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth,
each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Revolving Loans to the
Borrower, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Credit
Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding
not to exceed the excess, if any, of (i) such Lender's Revolving Credit
Commitment over (ii) its Letter of Credit Exposure at such time, provided that,
in no event shall the Lenders be required to make any Revolving Loans if, after
giving effect to such Loans, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Revolving Loans on any date plus (ii) the Letter of Credit Exposure
on such date exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of all the
Lenders. On the Closing Date, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in Sections 4.01 and 4.02, the Lenders shall make Revolving
Loans to the Borrower in a minimum amount of $2,000,000. The Revolving Loans
made on the Closing Date shall initially be ABR Revolving Loans.

     (b) At any time during the period beginning 60 days prior to the Conversion
Date and ending on the date that is 30 Business Days prior to the Conversion
Date, the Borrower in its sole discretion may elect (the "Term-Out Option") by
written notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) to convert all or a portion of
the Revolving Loans outstanding on the Conversion Date into term loans (each
such loan, a "Term Loan") on the Conversion Date and (ii) subject to the terms
of Section 2.21(a), to request an extension of the expiration of any Letter of
Credit outstanding on the Term-Out Effective Date to a date no later than the
date which is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. The Term-Out Option
shall become effective on the Term-Out Effective Date upon the receipt by the
Administrative Agent of an Officers' Certificate, dated as of the Term-Out
Effective Date, certifying as of such date, that:

               (i) the ratio of Parent Consolidated Funded Debt to Parent
     Consolidated Cash Flow as of the Term-Out Effective Date shall be no
     greater than 5.00 to 1.00 (together with supporting calculations and pro
     forma financial statements demonstrating compliance with such condition to
     the satisfaction of the Agents);

               (ii) neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have
     made any Restricted Payment since the date of the most recent Borrowing or
     issuance of Letter of Credit if, on the date of such Restricted Payment,
     the ratio of (x) Parent Consolidated Cash Flow to (y) Parent Consolidated
     Interest Expense plus the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made by
     the Public Partnership to its equityholders during the

<PAGE>

                                                                              34

     Reference Period with respect to such date, was less than 0.75 to 1.00
     (together with supporting calculations and pro forma financial statements
     demonstrating compliance with such condition to the satisfaction of the
     Agents);

               (iii) on the Term-Out Effective Date, the Public Partnership and
     its Subsidiaries shall have in effect weather insurance coverage of at
     least $12,500,000 on a consolidated basis;

               (iv) the representations and warranties set forth in Article III
     hereof and the representations and warranties of the Borrower and the other
     Loan Parties set forth in the other Loan Documents shall be true and
     correct in all material respects on and as of the Term-Out Effective Date
     with the same effect as though made on and as of such date, except to the
     extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
     date (in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and
     correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date);

               (v) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing as of the Term-Out Effective Date; and

               (vi) the Tranche B Term-Out Effective Date (as defined in the
     Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement) shall have
     become, or will concurrently become, effective pursuant to the terms of
     Section 2.01(c) of the Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit
     Agreement.

     (c) The Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans
during the Revolving Credit Availability Period, within the limits set forth in
Section 2.01(a) and upon the other terms and subject to the other conditions and
limitations set forth herein, provided, that subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, at all times, Indebtedness outstanding under the Facility
shall not be less than $2,000,000 until the earlier of (x) the date when the
Facility shall have been terminated in full through acceleration or otherwise or
(y) the date when the Facilities Obligations with respect to Facility B shall
have been paid in full in cash and the Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments
shall have been fully terminated. Amounts paid or prepaid in respect of Term
Loans may not be reborrowed.

     Section 2.02 Loans. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing
consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, however, that the failure of
any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to
be made by such other Lender). The Loans comprising each Borrowing shall be in
an aggregate principal amount which is (i) an integral multiple of $100,000 and
not less than $500,000 in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) an integral
multiple of $100,000 in the case of ABR Loans (or, in the case of ABR Loans, an
aggregate principal amount equal to the remaining balance of the Revolving
Credit Commitments).

     (b) A particular Borrowing of any Class shall consist solely of ABR Loans
or Eurodollar Loans of such Class, as the Borrower may request pursuant to
Section 2.03. Each

                                                                              35

Lender may at its option fulfill its Commitment with respect to any Eurodollar
Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to
make such Loan; provided, that any exercise of such option shall not affect the
obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the applicable Note. Borrowings of more than one Type and
Eurodollar Loans bearing interest for more than one specific Interest Period may
be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not
be entitled to request any Borrowing which, if made, would result in an
aggregate of more than five separate Eurodollar Loans of any Lender being
outstanding hereunder at any one time. For purposes of the foregoing, Loans
having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the
same date, shall be considered separate Loans.

     (c) Each Lender shall make a Loan in the amount of its pro rata portion, as
determined under Section 2.16, of each Borrowing hereunder on the proposed date
thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative
Agent at the Funding Office, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, and
the Administrative Agent shall by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, credit the
amounts so received to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the
Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any
condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts
so received to the respective Lenders.

     (d) If the Administrative Agent has not received from the Borrower the
payment required by Section 2.21(f) by 12:30 p.m., New York City time, on the
date on which the Issuing Bank has notified the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent that payment of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit of any Class
will be made, as provided in Section 2.21(f), the Administrative Agent will
promptly notify the Issuing Bank and each Lender of the Letter of Credit
Disbursement of such Class and, in the case of each Lender, its pro rata share
(based on such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Class) of
such Letter of Credit Disbursement. Not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City
time, on such date, each Lender shall make available its pro rata share, as so
determined, of such Letter of Credit Disbursement, in Federal or other funds
immediately available, to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office, and
the Administrative Agent will promptly make such funds available to the Issuing
Bank. The Administrative Agent will promptly remit to each Lender that shall
have made such funds available its pro rata share, as so determined, of any
amounts subsequently received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower in
respect of such Letter of Credit Disbursement.

     (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing, or prior to the time of any required
payment by such Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit Disbursement, that such
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's pro
rata portion of such Borrowing or payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on
the date of such Borrowing or payment in accordance with Section 2.02(c) or (d),
as applicable, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower or Issuing Bank, as applicable, on
such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall
not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender
and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower or the Issuing

<PAGE>

                                                                              36

Bank (or, if the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank are the same Person,
from the date of such payment in respect of a Letter of Credit Disbursement), as
applicable, until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at,
(i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant
to Section 2.06 or 2.21(f), as applicable and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount in respect of a Borrowing, such
amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.

     (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Credit Borrowing if the Interest
Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Conversion Date.
Further, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, nor shall any Lender be
required to make, any Eurodollar Loan during the existence of a Default or an
Event of Default unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree.

     Section 2.03 Notice of Borrowings. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent telephone notice (promptly confirmed in writing or by
telecopy in the form of Exhibit I-1 hereto) (a) in the case of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
before a proposed borrowing and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the proposed
borrowing. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case refer to this
Agreement and specify (i) the applicable Class and Type of such Borrowing; (ii)
the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount
thereof; and (iii) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period with respect thereto. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing
is specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR
Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing is
specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period of one month's duration. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03
and of each Lender's pro rata portion of the requested Borrowing.

     Section 2.04 Notes; Repayment of Loans. The Loans made by each Lender shall
be evidenced by a Note, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower,
dated the Closing Date, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
with the blanks appropriately filled, payable to the order of such Lender in a
principal amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment. The
outstanding principal balance of each Loan, as evidenced by the applicable Note,
shall be payable (a) subject to Section 2.01(b), in the case of a Revolving
Loan, on the Conversion Date and (b) in the case of a Term Loan, as provided in
Section 2.11. Each Note shall bear interest from the date of the first Borrowing
hereunder on the outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section
2.06. Each Lender shall, and is hereby authorized by the Borrower to, endorse on
the schedule attached to each Note delivered to such Lender (or on a
continuation of such schedule attached to such Note and made a part thereof), or
otherwise to record in such Lender's internal records, an appropriate notation
evidencing the date and amount of each applicable Loan from such Lender, each
payment and prepayment of principal of any such Loan, each payment of interest
on any such Loan and the other information provided for on such schedule;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any
error therein shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans
made by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
applicable Notes.

                                                                              37

     Section 2.05 Fees.

     The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender, on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, and
on the last day of the Revolving Credit Availability Period, a commitment fee (a
"Commitment Fee") on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitment of such Lender during the preceding calendar quarter (or shorter
period commencing with the date of this Agreement or ending with the last day of
the Revolving Credit Availability Period), equal to (i) during any Level I
Pricing Period, 0.25% per annum, (ii) during any Level II Pricing Period, 0.375%
per annum and (iii) at all other times, 0.50% per annum. The "unused amount" of
the Revolving Credit Commitment of a Lender on any date means the amount of such
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment on such date, less the sum of its
outstanding Revolving Loans on such date and its Letter of Credit Exposure on
such date. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Commitment Fee due to each
Lender shall commence to accrue from the date of this Agreement and shall cease
to accrue on the last day of the Revolving Credit Availability Period.

     (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, the fees set forth in the Letter Agreement dated August 19, 2003 (the
"Letter Agreement"), among the Administrative Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
and the Borrower, in the amounts and on the dates provided in the Letter
Agreement. Such fees shall be in addition to reimbursement of the Agents'
reasonable out- of-pocket expenses.

     (b) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

     Section 2.06 Interest on Loans.

     (a) Subject to Section 2.07, each Revolving Loan or Term Loan comprising an
ABR Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from the date such Loan is made
until it becomes due (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 360 days, except that, with respect to ABR Loans the rate of
interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, the interest
thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be)
day year for the actual days elapsed) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate
Base Rate, plus the Applicable ABR Margin.

     (b) Subject to Section 2.07, each Revolving Loan or Term Loan comprising a
Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from the date such Loan is
made until it becomes due (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO
Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing, plus the Applicable
Eurodollar Margin.

     (c) Any change in any Applicable Margin required hereunder shall be deemed
to occur five Business Days after the date the Borrower delivers its financial
statements required by Section 5.02(a) or (b), as the case may be, in respect of
its most recent fiscal quarter and the certificate required by Section 5.02(c);
provided, that if the Borrower fails to deliver such financial statements and
certificate on or before the date such statements and certificate are

<PAGE>

                                                                              38

required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(a) or (b), as the case may be,
and Section 5.02(c), the Applicable Margin for the period from such required
date until the date such statements and certificate are actually delivered shall
be calculated as if a Level III Pricing Period were in effect, and after the
date such statements and certificate are actually delivered the Applicable
Margin shall be determined as otherwise provided for herein.

     (d) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment Dates
applicable to such Loan, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The
applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate for each Interest Period or
day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

     Section 2.07 Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in the payment
of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming due
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, by acceleration or otherwise,
interest shall accrue, to the extent permitted by law, on such defaulted amount
during the period from (and including) the date of such default to (but not
including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at (a)
in the case of principal or interest on any Loan, the rate per annum (computed
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) that
would otherwise be applicable to such Loan pursuant to Section 2.06 as if a
Level III Pricing Period were in effect, plus 2.00% or (b) in the case of any
other amount, a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the rate applicable to ABR
Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 as if a Level III Pricing Period were
in effect, plus 2.00%. The Borrower shall pay all such accrued but unpaid
interest from time to time upon demand.

     Section 2.08 Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have
determined that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising
such Borrowing are not generally available in the applicable interbank market,
or that the rates at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining
its Eurodollar Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall,
as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telecopy notice of such
determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such
determination, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant
to Section 2.03 or 2.10 shall, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised
the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice
no longer exist, be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

     Section 2.09 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Revolving
Credit Commitments shall be automatically terminated at 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the Conversion Date.

     (b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or
telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any time in
whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided,

<PAGE>

                                                                              39

however, that (i) the Borrower simultaneously reduce Facility B by a pro rata
amount, provided that, the Borrower may, at its option, elect the aggregate
amount of any such reduction to be applied, first, to this Facility, and,
second, to Facility B, (ii) in the event the Borrower permanently terminates or
reduces Facility B in whole, the Borrower shall simultaneously terminate or
reduce, as the case may be, this Facility, (iii) each partial reduction of the
Revolving Credit Commitments and Facility B shall be in a minimum collective
aggregate principal amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not
less than $500,000 and (iv) no such termination or reduction of Revolving Credit
Commitments shall be permitted if, (1) after giving effect thereto and to any
prepayments of the Revolving Loans made on the effective date thereof,
Indebtedness outstanding under the Facility shall be less than $2,000,000 unless
the Facility Obligations are simultaneously paid in full in cash and the
Commitments under this Facility are fully terminated or (2) the sum of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus the Letter of
Credit Exposure would exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments.

     (c) In the event, and on each occasion, that the Borrower is required to
prepay or repay the Revolving Loans and/or to provide cash collateral for the
Letters of Credit as provided in Section 2.11(c) or (d) and Section 2.11(f),
then on the date of such required action, the Revolving Credit Commitments shall
be automatically and permanently reduced by an amount equal to the sum of such
required payment and cash collateral; provided, however that (i) the Borrower
simultaneously reduce Facility B by a pro rata portion of the amount of such
prepayment or reduction determined pursuant to the allocation method set forth
in Section 4(d)(ii) of the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) in the event the
Borrower prepays the amount of Facility B, in whole, the Borrower shall
simultaneously prepay this Facility in its entirety and (iii) in no event shall
any such reduction or prepayment reduce either (x) the outstanding Indebtedness
under this Facility to an amount less than $2,000,000 or (y) the outstanding
Indebtedness under Facility B to an amount less than $500,000, in each case,
unless the Facility Obligations are simultaneously paid in full in cash and the
Commitments are terminated in full. In addition, the Revolving Credit
Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced by the amount of
Excess Proceeds referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of Section 2.11 which is
allocable to reduce such Commitments as provided in Section 2.11(f). For
purposes of applying the requirements of this Section 2.09(c), the amount of any
Excess Proceeds referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) of Section 2.11 which is
allocable to the Facility Obligations shall be calculated as if the definition
set forth in the last sentence of Section 2.11(c) included, in addition, the
maximum aggregate amount of the unused Revolving Credit Commitments.

     (d) Each reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments in accordance with
this Article II shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Revolving Credit Commitments. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, on the date of each
termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class, the
Commitment Fees on the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class
so terminated or reduced accrued to the date of such termination or reduction.

     Section 2.10 Conversion and Continuation of Borrowings. The Borrower shall
have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable notice to the Administrative
Agent (a) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of
conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing, (b) not
later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to
conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Borrowing into a

                                                                              40

Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Borrowing as a Eurodollar
Borrowing for an additional Interest Period and (c) not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days prior to conversion, to convert the
Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible
Interest Period, subject in each case to the following:

               (i) each conversion or continuation shall be made pro rata among
     the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the
     Loans comprising the converted or continued Borrowing;

               (ii) the aggregate principal amount of such Borrowing converted
     into or continued as (A) a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall be an integral
     multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000 or (B) an ABR Borrowing,
     shall be the lesser of (I) the remaining outstanding principal amount of
     such Borrowing and (II) an integral multiple of $100,000;

               (iii) each conversion or continuation shall be effected by each
     Lender by applying the proceeds of the new Loan of such Lender resulting
     from such conversion or continuation to the Loan (or portion thereof) of
     such Lender being converted or continued; accrued interest on a Eurodollar
     Loan (or portion thereof) being converted or continued shall be paid by the
     Borrower at the time of conversion;

               (iv) if any Eurodollar Borrowing is converted or continued at a
     time other than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the
     Borrower shall pay, upon demand, any amounts due to the Lenders pursuant to
     Section 2.15;

               (v) any portion of a Borrowing maturing or required to be repaid
     in less than one month may not be converted into or continued as a
     Eurodollar Borrowing;

               (vi) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, during the
     existence of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall not be
     entitled to elect to have any Borrowing converted into or continued as a
     Eurodollar Borrowing;

               (vii) any portion of a Borrowing which cannot be converted into
     or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing by reason of clause (v) or (vi)
     above shall be automatically converted at the end of the Interest Period in
     effect for such Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing; and

               (viii) no Interest Period may be selected for any Eurodollar
     Borrowing that would end later than a Repayment Date occurring on or after
     the first day of such Interest Period if, after giving effect to such
     selection, the aggregate outstanding amount of (A) Eurodollar Borrowings
     with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such Repayment Date and (B) the
     ABR Borrowings would not be at least equal to the principal amount of
     Borrowings to be paid on such Repayment Date.

     Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be irrevocable and shall
refer to this Agreement and specify (I) the principal amount, the Type and, in
the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period of the Borrowing that
the Borrower requests be converted or continued, (II) whether such Borrowing is
to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar

<PAGE>

                                                                              41

Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing, (III) if such notice requests a conversion, the
date of such conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (IV) if such
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period with respect thereto. If no Interest Period is specified in any
such notice with respect to any conversion to or continuation as a Eurodollar
Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of
one month's duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise the other Lenders of
any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each Lender's pro rata
portion of any converted or continued Borrowing. If the Borrower shall not have
given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to continue any Borrowing into
a subsequent Interest Period (and shall not otherwise have given notice in
accordance with this Section 2.10 to convert such Borrowing), such Borrowing
shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid
pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically be continued into a new Interest
Period as an ABR Borrowing.

     Section 2.11 Mandatory Repayments and Prepayments.

     (a) On the Conversion Date, all Revolving Credit Borrowings not converted
into Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(b) shall be due and payable to the
extent not previously paid.

     (b) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.11(f) and Section
2.12(b), the Borrower shall repay the Term Loans and reduce the Letter of Credit
Exposure in quarterly installments, commencing on December 31, 2006, and
continuing on the last day of every third calendar month thereafter through
September 30, 2008 (the due date of each such installment being called a
"Repayment Date"); provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of
outstanding Indebtedness under this Facility be less than $2,000,000 at any time
unless the Facility Obligations are simultaneously paid in full in cash and the
Commitments under this Facility are terminated in full. The amount of any such
installment payable on a Repayment Date shall, subject to the proviso in the
preceding sentence, be the amount, if any, necessary (after giving effect to any
reductions on account of the expiration after the Conversion Date of any Letters
of Credit) to reduce the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Term
Loans outstanding immediately after the Conversion Date and (ii) the Letter of
Credit Exposure outstanding immediately after the Conversion Date by an
aggregate percentage of such sum equal to the percentage set forth opposite such
Repayment Date below:

December 31, 2006     12.5%
March 31, 2007        25.0%
June 30, 2007         37.5%
September 30, 2007    50.0%
December 31, 2007     62.5%
March 31, 2008        75.0%
June 30, 2008         87.5%
September 30, 2008   100.0%

On the Repayment Date that is September 30, 2008, the Borrower shall repay the
remaining principal and interest owing on all outstanding Term Loans and fully
cash collateralize any then existing Letter of Credit Exposure. All payments
under this paragraph (c) shall be applied

<PAGE>

                                                                              42

(I) first, to repay any outstanding Term Loans and (II) second, after the Term
Loans have been paid in full, to reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure. Any such
payments so applied to reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure shall be deposited
with the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement as
provided in Section 2.21(j).

     (c) If at any time the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
disposes of property or such property shall be damaged, destroyed or taken in
eminent domain or there shall be title insurance proceeds with respect to such
property, in any such case, with the result that there are Excess Proceeds, and
the Borrower does not apply such Excess Proceeds in the manner described in
Section 6.07(c)(iii)(B)(I), the Borrower shall prepay, upon notice as provided
in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.11 (which notice shall be given not later
than 180 days after the date of such sale of property), a principal amount of
the outstanding Facility Obligations equal to the amount of such remaining
Excess Proceeds allocable to the Facility Obligations, determined by allocating
such remaining Excess Proceeds pro rata among the Lenders, the lenders under the
Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement and the holders of
other Parity Debt, if any, outstanding on the date such prepayment is to be
made, according to the aggregate then unpaid principal amounts of the Facility
Obligations, the Facilities Obligations and other Parity Debt (and the Make
Whole Amount on the principal amount of the Mortgage Notes to be prepaid) in
accordance with the allocation method set forth in Section 4(d)(ii) of the
Intercreditor Agreement. For purposes of this Section 2.11, the "aggregate then
unpaid principal amount of the Facilities Obligations" shall equal the sum of
(A) the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Loans (as defined in the
Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement), (B) the Letter of
Credit Exposure (as defined in the Working Capital and Acquisition Facility
Credit Agreement), and (C) the maximum aggregate amount of the unused Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitments (as defined in the Working Capital and Acquisition
Facility Credit Agreement).

     (d) In the event that damage, destruction or a taking shall occur in
respect of all or a portion of the properties subject to any of the Collateral
Documents, or there shall be proceeds under title insurance policies with
respect to any real property, all Net Insurance Proceeds (as defined in the
Mortgage), self-insurance amounts, Net Awards (as defined in the Mortgage) or
title insurance proceeds which, as of any date, shall not theretofore have been
applied to the cost of Restoration (as defined in the Mortgage) shall be deemed
to be proceeds of property disposed of voluntarily, shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 6.07(c) and, if subdivision (iii)(B)(I) of Section 6.07(c)
is applicable thereto, shall be subject to the prepayment provisions of
paragraph (c) of this Section 2.11; provided, that, if any such event or
circumstances (individually or together with all other related events and
circumstances) shall result in proceeds of more than $25,000,000 in the
aggregate, the Borrower shall not apply such proceeds to replacement or other
assets or undertake any Restoration without the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders.

     (e) The Borrower will give the Administrative Agent irrevocable written
notice of each prepayment under paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section 2.11 not
less than 10 days and not more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for such
prepayment, in each case specifying such prepayment date, the aggregate
principal amount of the Facility Obligations to be prepaid, the aggregate
principal amount of the Facilities Obligations to be prepaid and the principal
amount of each issue of Parity Debt to be prepaid and the paragraph under which
such prepayment is to

<PAGE>

                                                                              43

be made. Each Lender shall receive, on the Business Day immediately preceding
the date scheduled for any such prepayment, a certificate of a Financial Officer
of the Borrower certifying that the applicable conditions of this Section 2.11
have been fulfilled and specifying the particulars of such fulfillment. Such
certificate shall set forth the principal amount of the Facility Obligations
being prepaid and specify how such amount was determined, and certify that such
amount has been computed in accordance with this Section 2.11.

     (f) All mandatory prepayments of the Facility Obligations under paragraphs
(c) and (d) of this Section 2.11 shall be applied (i) first, to pay or prepay
any outstanding Revolving Loans or Term Loans and, to the extent that the
remaining amount of such prepayment is greater than the aggregate principal
amount of outstanding Loans, to reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure and (ii)
second, to permanently reduce any remaining unused Commitments as contemplated
by Section 2.09(c), provided that, in the event that any such prepayment would
reduce the outstanding Indebtedness under this Facility to an amount less than
$2,000,000 prior to the date that the Facility Obligations have been paid in
full in cash and the Commitments have been fully terminated, an amount equal to
the excess of (x) the amount of such prepayment minus (y) the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Loans on the date of such prepayment
or reduction plus the Letter of Credit Exposure on such date shall be deposited
with the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement as
provided in Section 2.21(j). All such mandatory prepayments so applied on or
after the Conversion Date shall be applied to reduce the amount of scheduled
payments due under Section 2.11(b) after the date of such prepayment in the
inverse order of maturity (without affecting the requirement that such
prepayments be applied first to pay all outstanding Term Loans and only
thereafter to reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure). Subject to the foregoing
provisions, any such mandatory prepayment of Loans of any Class shall be applied
to prepay all ABR Loans of such Class before any Eurodollar Loans of such Class
are prepaid. Any such payments under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section 2.11
so applied to reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure shall be deposited with the
Trustee and applied as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

     (g) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of (i) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans and (ii) the Letter of
Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments
at such time, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans (and, to the
extent that the amount of such excess is greater than the aggregate principal
amount of outstanding Revolving Loans, reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure by
making a deposit with the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral
Agreement as provided in Section 2.21(j)) in an aggregate principal amount equal
to such excess.

     (h) Each payment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be
accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount paid to but excluding
the date of payment. The repayments and prepayments of the Loans required by the
respective subsections of this Section 2.11 and the optional prepayments
permitted by Section 2.12 are separate and cumulative, so that any one such
repayment or prepayment shall reduce any other repayment or prepayment only as
and to the extent expressly specified herein. All payments under this Section
2.11 shall be subject to Section 2.15, but otherwise shall be without premium or
penalty.

     Section 2.12 Optional Prepayments. (a) Subject to Section 2.01(c) and
Section 2.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay

<PAGE>

                                                                              44

any Borrowing or payment due under Section 2.11(b), in whole or in part, upon
prior written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by
written or telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent (i) in the case of any
prepayment of amounts payable under Section 2.11(b), not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days in advance of the proposed prepayment,
(ii) in the case of any prepayment of Eurodollar Revolving Loans, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days in advance of the proposed
prepayment and (iii) in the case of any prepayment of ABR Revolving Loans, not
later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the proposed
prepayment; provided, however, that (A) the Borrower simultaneously reduce
Facility B pro rata, such that the prepayments made pursuant to this Section
2.12(a) and Section 2.12(a) of the Working Capital and Acquisition Facility
Credit Agreement shall be in equal dollar amounts; provided, that (i) the
Borrower may, at its option, elect the aggregate amount of such prepayments to
be applied, first, to this Facility and, second, to Facility B, provided,
further, that in no event shall such reduction or prepayment reduce the
aggregate outstanding Indebtedness under this Facility to an amount less than
$2,000,000 or the aggregate outstanding Indebtedness under Facility B to an
amount less than $500,000 at any time, in either case unless the Facility
Obligations are simultaneously paid in full in cash and the Commitments are
terminated in full, (B) each partial prepayment of ABR Loans shall be in a
minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 under each of Facility B and this Facility
and each partial prepayment of Eurodollar Loans shall be in an amount which is
an integral multiple of $100,000 under each of Facility B and this Facility and
not less than $500,000 under each of Facility B and this Facility, (C) in the
event that the Borrower prepays the lenders under Facility B with respect to the
term loans thereunder, in whole, the Borrower shall simultaneously prepay in
whole the Term Loans under this Facility and (D) a partial prepayment of a
Eurodollar Borrowing under this Section 2.12(a) shall not be made that would
result in the remaining aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof under
each of Facility B and this Facility being less than $500,000. Each notice of
prepayment of any Borrowing or payment due under Section 2.11(b) shall specify
the prepayment date, the Class, the Type and the Interest Period of the
Borrowing to be prepaid (in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing), and the
principal amount thereof to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit
the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing or payment by the amount stated therein on
the date stated therein.

     (b) All prepayments under this Section 2.12 shall be subject to Section
2.15 but otherwise shall be without premium or penalty. All prepayments under
this Section 2.12 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal
amount being prepaid to, but excluding, the date of payment. All prepayments
under this Section 2.12 of amounts payable under Section 2.11(b) shall be
applied to reduce the amount of scheduled payments of amounts due under Section
2.11(b) after the date of such prepayment in the inverse order of maturity
(without affecting the requirement that such prepayments be applied first to pay
all outstanding Term Loans and only thereafter to provide cash collateral in
respect of Letters of Credit) until the last four of such scheduled payments
shall have been repaid in full, and thereafter all such prepayments of amounts
payable under Section 2.11(b) shall be applied to reduce such remaining
scheduled payments pro rata. Subject to the foregoing provisions, any optional
prepayment of Loans of any Class pursuant to Section 2.12(a) shall be applied to
prepay all ABR Loans of such Class before any Eurodollar Loans of such Class are
prepaid.

     Section 2.13 Reserve Requirements; Certain Changes in Circumstances. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement
any change in

<PAGE>

                                                                              45

applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or administration thereof
by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof (whether or not having the force of law) shall change the basis of
taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on any
Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or any Fees or other amounts payable
hereunder (other than changes in respect of taxes imposed on the overall net
income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal
office or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein), or shall
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or credit
extended by such Lender (except any such reserve requirement which is reflected
in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or shall impose on such Lender or the applicable
interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar
Loans made by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to
increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder
or under the Notes (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) or Letters of
Credit by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time
the Borrower shall pay to such Lender upon demand such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.

     (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption after the date
hereof of any law, rule, regulation, agreement or guideline regarding capital
adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the interpretation or
administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or
any Lender's holding company with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or
the Loans made by such Lender pursuant hereto to a level below that which such
Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies
and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Lender's holding company to
be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender upon
demand such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

     (c) A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as
shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company as specified
in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it
within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

     (d) No Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section 2.13 for
any costs incurred or reductions suffered with respect to any date unless such
Lender shall have notified the Borrower that it will demand compensation for
such costs or reductions not more than 120 days after the later of (i) such date
and (ii) the date on which such Lender becomes aware of such costs or
reductions. Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any
increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in
return on capital

<PAGE>

                                                                              46

with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right
to demand compensation with respect to any other period. The protection of this
Section 2.13 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible
contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation,
guideline or other change, condition or circumstances which shall have occurred
or been imposed.

     Section 2.14 Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof
by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation
thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar
Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to
any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written or telecopy notice to the Borrower and to
the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

               (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by
     such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrower for a
     Eurodollar Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for
     an ABR Borrowing unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn;
     and

               (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be
     converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be
     automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such
     notice as provided in Section 2.14(b).

In the event that any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (i) or (ii)
above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been
applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender
or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to
repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the
conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

     (b) For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice to the Borrower by any
Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last day
of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all
other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the
Borrower.

     Section 2.15 Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against
any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of
(a) any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the date of any borrowing
hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b) any failure by
the Borrower to borrow or to refinance, convert or continue any Loan hereunder
after irrevocable notice of such borrowing, refinancing, conversion or
continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.10, (c) any payment,
prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan required by any other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any default in payment or
prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest
accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due date thereof, whether
by scheduled maturity, acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or
otherwise) or (e) the occurrence of any Event of Default, including, in each
such case, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be
sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits

<PAGE>

                                                                              47

from third parties acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof
as a Eurodollar Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its
cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or not
borrowed, refinanced, converted or continued or not paid or prepaid (assumed to
be the Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the date of
such payment, prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow, refinance, convert or
continue or failure to pay or prepay to the last day of the Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, refinance, convert or
continue, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the
date of such failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined
by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds
so paid, prepaid, converted or not borrowed, refinanced, converted or continued
for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be based upon the purchase
of debt securities customarily issued by the Treasury of the United States of
America which have a maturity date approximating the last Business Day of such
Interest Period). A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or
amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15
shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. The Borrower shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

     Section 2.16 Pro Rata Treatment. Except as required under Section 2.13 or
2.14 and by the terms of this Agreement requiring pro rata treatment with
Facility B, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any
Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Commitment
Fees, each reduction of the Commitments, each payment in respect of
participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements and each refinancing of any
Borrowing with, conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing
as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class (or, if
such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the
respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans of the applicable
Class). Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any
Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion,
round each Lender's share of such Borrowing, computed in accordance with
Schedule 1.01A, to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.

     Section 2.17 Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it shall,
through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against
the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of
the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu
of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law or otherwise (except pursuant to Section 2.20),
or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of
any Loan or Loans as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans
of any Class shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of
the Loans of such Class of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously
to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay
to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in such Loans of
such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans
and participations in Loans of any Class held by each Lender shall be in the
same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans of such
Class then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans of such Class prior
to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim

<PAGE>

                                                                              48

or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans of such Class
outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or
other event; provided, however, that if any such purchase or purchases or
adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.17 and the payment giving
rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or
adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase
price or prices or adjustment restored without interest (unless the party from
which such recovery is made is obligated by law to pay interest on the amount
recovered, in which case each of the Lenders shall be responsible for its pro
rata share of such interest). The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing
arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Loan deemed
to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien,
setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower
to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan
directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     Section 2.18 Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including
principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts)
hereunder or under any other Loan Document not later than 12:00 noon, New York
City time, on the date when due in dollars to the Administrative Agent at the
Funding Office, in immediately available funds. Any such payment received after
such time on any date shall be deemed made on the next Business Day.

     (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a
Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
interest or Fees, if applicable.

     Section 2.19 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this
Agreement, the Notes and the Letters of Credit shall be made free and clear of,
and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, assessments,
fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes
and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Agent
or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between such Agent
or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such
tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other
than any such connection arising solely from such Agent or such Lender having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or
enforced, this Agreement, the Notes or any Letters of Credit). If any such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees deductions or
withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld
from any amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the Notes
or any Letters of Credit, the amounts so payable to such Agent or such Lender
shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such Lender
(after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes) interest or any such
other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this
Agreement, the Notes and any Letters of Credit, provided, however, that the
Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any
Lender that is not organized under the laws of the

<PAGE>

                                                                              49

United States of America or a state thereof if such Lender fails to comply with
the requirements of Section 2.19(d).

     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as
promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative
Agent for its own account or for the account of the Documentation Agent, the
Syndication Agent or such other Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of
an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof.
If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate
taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required
receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify
the Agents and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that
may become payable by any Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

     (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the
Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two
copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or,
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of
Exhibit L and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors
thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming
complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on
all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it
becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or
before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In
addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the
obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S.
Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously
delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification
adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to
deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not
legally able to complete and deliver.

     (e) The provisions of this Section 2.19 shall remain operative and in full
force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of
the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf
of any Agent or any Lender.

     (f) Any Agent or Lender claiming any indemnity payment or additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall use reasonable efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or
document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a

<PAGE>

                                                                              50

filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such
indemnity payment or additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would
not, in the sole determination of such Agent or Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

     (g) Nothing contained in this Section 2.19 shall require any Agent or
Lender to make available any of its tax returns (or any other information that
it deems to be confidential or proprietary).

     (h) No Lender shall be entitled to claim any indemnity payment or
additional amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 with respect to any tax
unless such Lender shall have notified the Borrower that it will demand
compensation for such payment or amount not more than 120 days after the later
of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which such Lender becomes aware of the
costs or reductions giving rise to such claim. Failure on the part of any Lender
to demand any indemnity payment or any such additional amount with respect to
any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand
compensation with respect to any other period. The protection of this Section
2.19 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of
the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or
other change, condition or circumstances which shall have occurred or been
imposed.

     Section 2.20 Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances. In the
event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice or certificate pursuant to
Section 2.13 or 2.14, or the Borrower shall be required to pay additional
amounts to any Lender under Section 2.19, the Borrower shall have the right, at
its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to
require such Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with
and subject to the provisions set forth in Section 9.04, including clause (v) of
the proviso to Section 9.04(b)) all its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement to another financial institution designated by the Borrower which
shall assume such obligations; provided, that (i) a similar assignment by such
Lender be made under the Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit
Agreement of all its interests, rights and obligations under the Working Capital
and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement, (ii) no such assignment shall
conflict with any law, rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority
and (iii) the Borrower shall pay to the affected Lender (and shall take the same
actions under the Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement) in
immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the entire amount of
principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans and
participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements made by it hereunder and all
other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder; provided,
further, that if prior to any such assignment the circumstances or event that
resulted in such Lender's notice or certificate under Section 2.13 or 2.14 or
demand for additional amounts under Section 2.19, as the case may be, shall
cease to exist or become inapplicable for any reason or if such Lender shall
waive its rights in respect of such circumstances or event under Section 2.13,
2.14 or 2,19, as the case may be, then such Lender shall not thereafter be
required to make any such assignment hereunder or under the Working Capital and
Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement.

     Section 2.21 Letters of Credit.

     (a) The Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit, in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, for the
account of the Borrower, at

<PAGE>

                                                                              51

any time and from time to time during the Revolving Credit Availability Period;
provided, that any Letter of Credit shall be issued only if, and each request by
the Borrower for the issuance of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that, immediately following the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, the sum of (i) the Letter of Credit Exposure
and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans shall not
exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments at such time,
provided that, in no event shall the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Revolving Loans on any date plus (ii) the Letter of Credit
Exposure on such date exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of all
the Lenders and, provided, further, that the amount of all outstanding Tranche B
Letters of Credit (as defined in the Working Capital and Acquisition Facility
Credit Agreement) and the Letters of Credit shall not exceed $12,500,000. Each
Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of (x) the
first anniversary of the date of issuance thereof and (y) five Business Days
prior to the Conversion Date (or, if the Term-Out Option has become effective
pursuant to Section 2.01(b), five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date)
unless such Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date; provided,
that any Letter of Credit with an expiration date on the first anniversary one
year from date of issuance may provide for the renewal thereof for additional
one-year periods but shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in
clause (y) above. Each Letter of Credit shall provide for payments of drawings
in dollars.

     (b) Each issuance of any Letter of Credit shall be made on at least two
Business Days' prior irrevocable written or telecopy notice (or such shorter
notice as shall be acceptable to the Issuing Bank) from the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank specifying, on the Issuing Bank's
standard form or on such other form as is acceptable to the Issuing Bank, the
date of issuance, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire, the
amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary of such
Letter of Credit, and such other information as may be necessary or desirable to
complete such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank will give the Administrative
Agent prompt notice of the issuance and amount of such Letter of Credit and the
expiration date of such Letter of Credit (and the Administrative Agent shall
give prompt notice thereof to each Lender). The Issuing Bank also will give the
Administrative Agent a quarterly summary indicating the issuance of any Letter
of Credit and the amount thereof, the expiration of any Letter of Credit and the
amount thereof and the payment on any draft presented under any Letter of
Credit. The Administrative Agent will promptly provide the Lenders with copies
of each such quarterly summary.

     (c) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit and without any further action on
the part of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in respect
thereof, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Bank, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of
Credit, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's pro rata
share (based on such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage) of the
aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely
and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the
Issuing Bank, in accordance with Section 2.02(d), such Lender's pro rata share
(based on such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage) of each Letter
of Credit Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the
Borrower when due in accordance with Section 2.21(f); provided, that the Lenders
shall not be

<PAGE>

                                                                              52

obligated to make any such payment with respect to any wrongful Letter of Credit
Disbursement made as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Issuing Bank.

     (d) Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to Section 2.21(c) in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of
Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or reduction whatsoever (subject only to the proviso set forth in
Section 2.21(c)).

     (e) During the Revolving Credit Availability Period, the Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent, on the last day of March, June, September and
December in each year and on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments
shall be terminated as provided herein, (i) for the account of the Lenders,
ratably in proportion to their Revolving Credit Commitments, a fee on the
average daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under all outstanding
Letters of Credit during the preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing
with the date of this Agreement) at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable
Eurodollar Margin from time to time in effect during such period pursuant to
Section 2.06 and (ii) for the account of the Issuing Bank, a fee on the average
daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under all outstanding Letters of
Credit during the preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date
of this Agreement) at a rate per annum equal to 0.125%. Such fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360
days. Such fees shall accrue from and including the date of this Agreement to
but excluding the last day of the Revolving Credit Availability Period. In
addition to the foregoing, the Borrower shall pay directly to the Issuing Bank,
for its account, payable within 15 days after demand therefor by the Issuing
Bank, the Issuing Bank's customary processing and documentation fees in
connection with the issuance or amendment of or payment on any Letter of Credit.

     (f) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any
payment or disbursement made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, by
making payment in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent, in an
amount equal to the amount of such payment or disbursement, not later than 12:00
Noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives
notice of such draft, if such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00
A.M., New York City time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the
Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such
notice, plus interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by the Issuing Bank, to
the extent not reimbursed prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of
such payment or disbursement, from and including the date paid or disbursed to
but excluding the date the Issuing Bank is reimbursed by the Borrower therefor,
at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans during
such period pursuant to Section 2.06. If the Borrower shall fail to pay any
amount required to be paid by it under this Section 2.21(f) when due, such
unpaid amount shall bear interest as provided in Section 2.07. The Issuing Bank
shall give the Borrower prompt notice of each drawing under any Letter of
Credit, provided, that the failure to give any such notice shall in no way
affect, impair or diminish the Borrower's obligations hereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay any such amounts received by it to the
Issuing Bank.

<PAGE>

                                                                              53

     (g) The Borrower's obligation to reimburse Letter of Credit Disbursements
as provided in Section 2.21(f) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable
and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:

               (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
     Credit or any other Loan Document;

               (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
     which the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person may at any time have
     against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank, any
     Agent, any Lender or any other Person in connection with this Agreement,
     any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or
     transaction;

               (iii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
     Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
     respect or failing to comply with the Uniform Customs and Practices for
     Documentary Credits, as in effect from time to time, or any statement
     therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

               (iv) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
     presentation of a draft or other document which does not comply with the
     terms of such Letter of Credit; provided, that such payment was not
     wrongfully made as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct
     of the Issuing Bank; and

               (v) any other act or omission or delay of any kind or any other
     circumstance or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
     foregoing and whether or not foreseeable, that might, but for the
     provisions of this Section 2.21(g), constitute a legal or equitable
     discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

     (h) It is expressly understood and agreed that, for purposes of determining
whether a wrongful payment under a Letter of Credit resulted from the Issuing
Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct, (i) the Issuing Bank's acceptance
of documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility
for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the
contrary, (ii) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented
to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein,
including the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether
or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such
draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of
Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect (so long as such document on its
face appears to be in order), and whether or not any other statement or any
other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged
or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any
respect whatsoever and (iii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the
documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in
each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of
the Issuing Bank. It is further understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the
proviso to clause (iv) of Section 2.21(g), the Borrower's obligation hereunder
to reimburse Letter of Credit Disbursements will not be excused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank to the extent that such
Letter of Credit Disbursement actually discharged a liability

<PAGE>

                                                                              54

of, or otherwise benefited, or was recovered by, the Borrower; provided, that
the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability
to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages suffered by the Borrower
that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof.

     (i) The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine
all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of
Credit, including as to compliance with the Uniform Customs and Practices for
Documentary Credits, as then in effect. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as
possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by telex or telecopy, to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the
Issuing Bank has made or will make a Letter of Credit Disbursement thereunder,
provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of
its obligation to reimburse any such Letter of Credit Disbursement in accordance
with this Section 2.21. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender
notice thereof.

     (j) In the event that the Borrower is required or elects pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (other than Sections 2.11(f) and 7.01) to provide cash
collateral in respect of the Letter of Credit Exposure of any Class, the
Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent an amount in
cash equal to the Letter of Credit Exposure of such Class (or such lesser amount
as shall be required or elected hereunder). Any such deposit shall be held by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Cash Collateral Agreement. In
the event that the Borrower is required pursuant to the terms of Section 2.11(f)
or Section 7.01 of this Agreement to provide cash collateral in respect of the
Letter of Credit Exposure of any Class, the Borrower shall deposit such cash
collateral in an account with the Trustee pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement. Such deposit shall be held by the Trustee in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement. Any such deposit to be held by the Administrative Agent
or the Trustee, as provided herein, shall be accompanied by notice from the
Borrower, in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the Trustee, as
the case may be, setting forth the basis for such deposit, identifying in
reasonable detail the Letters of Credit to which such deposit relates, and
setting forth any other information related to such deposit reasonably requested
by the Administrative Agent or the Trustee, as the case may be. The Borrower
shall promptly provide the Administrative Agent with a copy of any such notice
to the Trustee and shall promptly provide the Trustee with a copy of any such
notice to the Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The Borrower represents and warrants to each of the Lenders that:

     Section 3.01 Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and the Loan

standing as a foreign limited partnership (in the case of the Borrower and the
Public Partnership) or a limited liability company or corporation (in the case
of the other Loan Parties) in all jurisdictions in which the nature of their
respective activities or the character of the properties they own, lease or use
makes such qualification or registration necessary and in which the failure so
to qualify or to be so registered would have a Material Adverse Effect (and the
only such jurisdictions are, in the case of the Borrower and the Public
Partnership, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin)

     Section 3.02 Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by each
of the Borrower and the Loan Parties of each of the Loan Documents to which it
is or will be a party, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and, in the case of the Borrower, the extensions of credit hereunder
(a) have been duly authorized by all requisite action and (b) will not (i)
violate (A) any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, or of the
agreement of limited partnership, operating agreement, articles of incorporation
or other constitutive documents or by-laws of the Borrower and the other Loan
Parties, (B) any order of any Governmental Authority or (C) any provision of any
indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Borrower or any of the
other Loan Parties is a party or by which any of them or any of their property

Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement, the Note Agreements
or the Parity Debt Agreements or (iii) except for the Lien of the Collateral
Documents, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect
to any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower or any
of the other Loan Parties.

     Section 3.03 Enforceability. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document when
executed and delivered by the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties does or

     (b) The Borrower has delivered to the Agents the unaudited pro forma

                                                                              57

consolidating balance sheet of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries as
at June 30, 2003, and the related consolidated and consolidating statements
conforming to the requirements of Section 5.02(a) (the "Unaudited Financial
Statements"), and such Unaudited Financial Statements present fairly the
consolidated financial condition of the Public Partnership and its Subsidiaries
or the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as at such
date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash

adjustments). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and
notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently
throughout the periods involved (except as disclosed by the aforementioned firm
of accountants and disclosed therein). Except for borrowings under the Existing
Credit Agreement and the Existing Parity Debt Credit Agreement, the balance
sheets and the notes thereto included in the Audited Financial Statements
disclose all material liabilities, actual or contingent, of the Loan Parties as
of the dates thereof. Except for borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement
and the Existing Parity Debt Credit Agreement and liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the date thereof (none of which, individually
or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect), the Borrower does
not have any material guarantee obligations, contingent liabilities and
liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term
commitments, including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange
transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not
reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph.
Notwithstanding the foregoing representation made in the two immediately
preceding sentences, such representation will be deemed breached (except for
purposes of Article IV hereof) only to the extent that such representation
involves undisclosed liabilities which could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Audited
Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto).

operations, property or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Loan Parties.
Since the date of this Agreement, there has occurred no condition, event or

assessments and other governmental charges levied upon it or any of its
properties, assets, income or franchises which are due and payable, other than
(a) those which are not past due or are presently being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted for which such reserves or other
appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be required by GAAP have been made and

Partner or the Borrower has ever established, maintained, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to, and neither the Borrower nor any Related Person of

as disclosed in Schedule 3.16, neither the Borrower nor any Related Person of
the Borrower has assumed, either by agreement (including the Partnership
Agreement and the Operative Agreements), by operation of law or otherwise, any
liability or obligation with respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined

practice or understanding. Neither the General Partner, nor the Borrower nor any
Related Person of the Borrower, or the General Partner has incurred any material
liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Plan and no event or
condition exists or has occurred as a result of which such a liability could
reasonably be expected to be incurred. None of the General Partner, the Borrower
nor any Related Person of the General Partner or the Borrower has engaged in any
transaction, including the transactions contemplated hereunder, which could
subject the Borrower or any Related Person of the Borrower to liability pursuant
to Section 4069(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA. There has been no reportable event
(within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA) or any other event or condition
with respect to any Plan which presents a risk of the termination of, or the
appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Plan by the PBGC. No prohibited
transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code) exists or has occurred with respect to any Plan which has subjected or
could reasonably be expected to subject the General Partner or the Borrower to a
material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code. No liability to the PBGC (other than liability for premiums not yet
due) has been or is expected to be incurred with regard to any Plan by the
General Partner, the Borrower or any Related Person. Neither the General
Partner, nor the Borrower nor any Related Person of the General Partner or the
Borrower contributes or is obligated to contribute or has ever contributed or
been obligated to contribute to any Single Employer Plan that has at least two
contributing sponsors not under common control. The Borrower is not, nor is it
expected to become, a "substantial employer" as defined in Section 4001(a)(2) of
ERISA with respect to any Plan. Neither the General Partner nor the Borrower has
ever maintained or contributed to any plan or arrangement which provides
post-employment welfare benefits or coverage (other than continuation coverage
provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code). With respect to any
post-employment welfare benefit plan or arrangement (other than continuation
coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code) established,
maintained, or contributed to, by any Related Person (or with respect to which a
Related Person is obligated to contribute), (i) the FAS 106 liabilities and the
assumptions used therefor accurately reflect the costs associated with the
rights and benefits of all participants and (ii) such benefits may be terminated
at any time without liability to the Borrower, General Partner or any Related
Party.

     Section 3.17 Environmental and Safety Matters. (a) Each of the Borrower and
the General Partner is in compliance with all Environmental Laws applicable to
it or to the Business or the Assets, except where such noncompliance would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has timely and properly applied for
renewal of all environmental permits or licenses that have expired or are about
to expire and are necessary for the conduct of the Business as now conducted and
as proposed to be conducted, except where the failure to timely and properly
reapply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.17 lists (i) all
notices from Federal, state or local environmental agencies to the Borrower, the
General Partner or any Affiliate thereof citing environmental violations
affecting the Business or the Assets that have not been finally resolved and
disposed of, and no such violation, whether or not notice regarding such
violation is listed on Schedule 3.17, if ultimately resolved against such party,
would have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) all current reports filed by the
Borrower, the General Partner or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the
Business or the Assets with any Federal, state or local environmental agency
having jurisdiction over the Business or the Assets, true and complete copies of
which reports have been made available to the Lenders. Notwithstanding any such
notice, except for matters the consequences of which will not have a Material
Adverse Effect, the Business and the Assets is currently being operated in all
respects within the limits set forth in such environmental permits or licenses
and any current noncompliance with such permits or licenses will not result in
any liability or penalty to the Borrower or the Subsidiaries or in the
revocation, loss or termination of any such environmental permits or licenses.

     (b) All facilities located on the real property owned or leased by the Loan
Parties which are subject to regulation by RCRA are and have been operated in
compliance with RCRA, except where such noncompliance would not have a Material
Adverse Effect and none of the Borrower, the General Partner and their
Affiliates has received, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, been threatened
with, a notice of violation of RCRA regarding such facilities.

     (c) No Hazardous Materials are or have been located or present at any of
the real property owned or leased by the Loan Parties or any previously owned
properties in violation of any Environmental Law, which violation will have a
Material Adverse Effect, or in such circumstances as to give rise to liability,
which liability will have a Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to such
real property there has not occurred (i) any release or threatened release of
any such hazardous substance, (ii) any discharge or threatened discharge of any
substance into ground, surface, or navigable waters which violates any
Environmental Law or (iii) any assertion of any lien pursuant to Environmental
Laws resulting from any use, spill, discharge or clean-up of any hazardous or
toxic substance or waste, which occurrence referred to in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) above will have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (d) The Borrower has not received notice that it has been identified as a
potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any comparable state, local or
foreign law nor has the Borrower received any notification that any Hazardous
Materials that it has used, generated, stored, treated, handled, transported or
disposed of or arranged for transport for disposal or treatment of, or arranged
for disposal or treatment of, has been found at any site at which any
Governmental Authority or private party is conducting or plans to conduct a
remedial investigation or other action pursuant to any Environmental Law.

     (e) None of the matters disclosed in Schedule 3.17, either individually or
in the aggregate, involves a violation of or a liability under any Environmental
Law, the consequences of which will have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 3.18 Security Interests. The Trustee for the benefit of the Secured
Parties will at all times have the Liens provided for in the Collateral
Documents and, subject to the filing by the Trustee of continuation statements
to the extent required by the Uniform Commercial Code, the Collateral Documents
will at all times constitute a valid and continuing lien of record and first
priority perfected security interest in all the Collateral referred to therein.
No filings or recordings, or amendments or supplements to any of the Collateral
Documents are required in order to perfect the security interests created under
the Collateral Documents, except for amendments, supplements, filings or
recordings listed on Schedule 3.18. All such amendments, supplements, listed
filings and recordings were made on or prior to the Closing Date, except as
otherwise expressly provided in Schedule 3.18.

     Section 3.19 Solvency. Upon the making of the initial Loan or the issuance
of the initial Letter of Credit hereunder, each of the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will be Solvent. "Solvent" means, with respect to any
Person, that (a) the sum of the assets of such Person, both at a fair valuation
and at present fair saleable value, will exceed the liabilities of such Person,
(b) such Person will have sufficient capital with which to conduct its business
as presently conducted and as proposed to be conducted and (c) such Person has
not incurred debts, and does not intend to incur debts, beyond its ability to
pay such debts as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing definition, "debts"
means any liabilities on claims, and "claim" means (i) a right to payment,
whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured or (ii) a right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to
an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured. With respect to any
contingent liabilities, such liabilities shall be computed at the amount which,
in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time, represents the
amount which can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability.

     Section 3.20 Transactions with Affiliates. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.20 and except for agreements and arrangements among the Borrower and Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiaries or among Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries,

properties and assets of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is subject to
or bound by, any agreement or arrangement with, and neither the Borrower nor any
of the Subsidiaries is engaged in any transaction with, (a) any Affiliate of the

     Section 3.22 Insurance. The Borrower and the Subsidiaries maintain with
Permitted Insurers policies of fire and casualty, liability, business
interruption and other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles
and against such risks and losses as are reasonable for the business and assets

effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid (other than
retroactive or retrospective premium adjustments that are not yet, but may be,
required to be paid with respect to any period ending prior to the Closing Date
under comprehensive general liability and workmen's compensation insurance
policies) and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with
respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on substantially similar
terms prior to the date of such cancellation. The activities and operations of
the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have been conducted in a manner so as to
conform in all material respects to all applicable provisions of such insurance
policies.

Borrower, threatened against any of them, before the National Labor Relations

Indebtedness incurred hereunder and under the Working Capital and Acquisition
Facility Credit Agreement, none of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries
has any secured or unsecured Indebtedness outstanding as of the Closing Date. As

the Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries
is bound or which is applicable to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries
(other than this Agreement, the Note Agreements, the Working Capital and

     States, (B) such corporation or limited partnership expressly and
     unconditionally assumes the obligations of the Borrower under this
     Agreement, each of the other Loan Documents, and delivers to each Lender at
     the time outstanding in connection with such assumption an opinion of
     counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Required Lenders with respect to
     such matters incident to such assumption as may be reasonably requested by

          subject to the Lien of the Collateral Documents and (5) to the extent
          such assets were acquired (in whole or in part) with the proceeds of

          (the amount of such excess net proceeds actually realized being herein
          called "Excess Proceeds"), the Borrower shall promptly pay over to the
          Trustee such Excess Proceeds not at the time held by the Trustee for
          application by the Trustee (I) within 180 days of the date of the
          disposal or loss of property, to the acquisition of assets in

          if any, pursuant to Section 2.11, all as provided in Section 4(d) of
          the Intercreditor Agreement and Section 2.11, and the Trustee shall
          have received an Officers' Certificate from the General Partner
          certifying that the consideration received for such property is at
          least equal to its fair value (as determined in good faith by the
          Board of Directors) and that such consideration has been applied in
          accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and

               (iv) in the case of any sale, lease or other disposition of
     Collateral which includes real property (or any interest therein), or any
     sale, lease or other disposition of Collateral resulting in the aggregate
     net proceeds of all such sales, leases or other dispositions exceeding
     $10,000,000, the Trustee shall have received an Officers' Certificate from
     the General Partner certifying that such sale, lease or other disposition
     is in the best interest of the Borrower and will not have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower and any Restricted Subsidiary may
sell or dispose of (x) real property assets sold or disposed of within 12 months
of the acquisition of such assets and (y) all other assets sold or disposed of
within 6 months of the acquisition of such assets, in

<PAGE>

                                                                              92

each case referred to in clause (x) or (y) constituting a portion of an acquired
business; provided, that (1) such assets are specifically designated to the
Administrative Agent in writing prior to such acquisition as assets to be
disposed of and (2) the Administrative Agent shall have received an Officers'
Certificate from the General Partner certifying that the consideration received
for such property is at least equal to its fair market value (as determined in
good faith by the General Partner). Such dispositions under this paragraph will
not be applied towards the cumulative limitations in paragraph (c)(iii)(A) of
this Section 6.07. The Lenders agree to take, at the expense of the Borrower,
all actions necessary to cause dispositions of Collateral made in compliance
with this Section 6.07 to be made free and clear of the liens created by the
Collateral Documents.

     Section 6.08 Partnership or Corporate Existence etc.; Business. (a) (i) The
Borrower will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect its
partnership existence and its status as a partnership not taxable as a
corporation for Federal income tax purposes; (ii) the Borrower will cause each
Restricted Subsidiary to keep in full force and effect its partnership or
corporate existence; and (iii) the Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect all of
its material rights and franchises (in each case except as otherwise
specifically permitted in Sections 6.06 and 6.07 and except that the partnership
or corporate existence of any Restricted Subsidiary, and any right or franchise
of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, may be terminated if, in the good
faith judgment of the General Partner, such termination is in the best interest
of the Borrower, is not disadvantageous to the Lenders in any material respect
and would not have a Material Adverse Effect).

     (b) The Borrower will not be obligated to preserve its status as a
partnership not taxable as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes if (i)
the Borrower's failure to preserve such status shall be the result of an
amendment to the tax laws enacted by the Congress of the United States and (ii)
after giving effect to the loss of such status the ratio of Consolidated Cash
Flow to Maximum Consolidated Pro Forma Debt Service, determined as of the date
of the loss of such status, would be greater than 1.1 to 1.0, assuming, for the
purposes of the computation of Consolidated Cash Flow, that Consolidated Cash
Flow would be reduced by taxes at the applicable tax rate for the Borrower for
such period had the Borrower been taxable as a corporation.

     (c) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, engage in any line of business other than the Business in which the Borrower
or its Restricted Subsidiaries are engaged on the Closing Date and described in
the Public Partnership's SEC Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2000 and other activities incidental or related to the Business.

     Section 6.09 Payment of Taxes and Claims. The Borrower will, and will cause
each Subsidiary to, pay all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges or
levies imposed upon it or any of its properties or assets or in respect of any
of its franchises, business, income or profits when the same become due and
payable, but in any event before any penalty or interest accrues thereon, and
all claims (including claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) for
sums which have become due and payable and which by law have or might become a
Lien upon any of its properties or assets, and promptly reimburse the Agents,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders for any such taxes, assessments, charges or
claims paid by them; provided, that no such

<PAGE>

                                                                              93

tax, assessment, charge or claim need be paid or reimbursed if being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly initiated and diligently
conducted and if such reserves or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall
be required by GAAP shall have been made therefor and be adequate in the good
faith judgment of the General Partner.

     Section 6.10 Compliance with ERISA. The Borrower will not, and will not
permit any Subsidiary or Related Person of the Borrower to:

     (a) (i) engage in any transaction in connection with which the Borrower or
any Related Person or Subsidiary could be subject to either a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of
the Code, (ii) terminate (within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA) or withdraw
from any Plan in any manner, or take, or fail to take, any other action with
respect to any Plan (including a substantial cessation of operations within the
meaning of Section 4062(e) of ERISA), (iii) establish, maintain, contribute to
or become obligated to contribute to any welfare benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) or other welfare benefit arrangement which provides
post-employment benefits, which cannot be unilaterally terminated by the
Borrower, (iv) fail to make full payment when due of all amounts which, under
the provisions of any Plan or applicable law, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Related Person of the Borrower is required to pay as contributions thereto,
result in the imposition of a Lien or permit to exist any material accumulated
funding deficiency, whether or not waived, with respect to any Plan, or (v)
engage in any transaction in connection with which the Borrower, any Subsidiary
or any Related Person of the Borrower could be subject to liability pursuant to
Section 4069(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA, if, as a result of any such event,
condition or transaction described in clauses (i) through (v) above, either
individually or together with any other such event or condition, could result in
(x) the imposition of a Lien on any assets or property of the Borrower or any
Related Person or (y) any liability to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any
Related Person of the Borrower, which liability could have a Material Adverse
Effect; or

     (b) as of any date of determination (i) permit the amount of unfunded
benefit liabilities under any Plan to exceed the current value of the assets of
any such Plan by more than $250,000 or (ii) permit the aggregate liability
incurred by the Borrower and any Subsidiary and Related Persons of the Borrower
pursuant to Title IV of ERISA with respect to one or more terminations of, or
one or more complete or partial withdrawals from, any Plan to exceed $1,000,000.

As used in this Section 6.10, the term "accumulated funding deficiency" has the
meaning specified in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, the term
"current value" has the meaning specified in Section 3 of ERISA and the terms
"benefit liabilities" and "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" have the
meanings specified in Section 4001 of ERISA.

     Section 6.11 Maintenance of Properties; Insurance. (a) The Borrower will
maintain or cause to be maintained in working order and condition, in accordance
with normal industry standards, all material properties used or useful in the
business of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries and from time to time
will make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements
thereof.

     (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to, keep its insurable properties adequately insured at all times by Permitted
Insurers; maintain such other insurance, to such extent and against such risks,
including fire and other risks insured against by extended coverage, as is
customary with companies in the same or similar businesses, including public
liability insurance against claims for personal injury or death or property
damage occurring upon, in, about or in connection with the use of any properties
owned, occupied or controlled by it; maintain such other insurance as may be
required by law or any Collateral Document; and cause each such insurance policy
to name the Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, as an additional insured
or loss payee thereunder. The Borrower will permit the Agents and an insurance
consultant retained by the Agents, at the expense of the Borrower, to review the
insurance policies maintained by the Borrower on an annual basis and will
implement any changes to such policies reasonably recommended by such
consultant.

     Section 6.12 Operative Agreements; Collateral Documents. The Borrower will,
and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, perform and comply with all of its
obligations under each of the Operative Agreements to which it is a party, will
enforce each such Operative Agreement against each other party thereto and will
not accept the termination of any such Operative Agreement, unless the taking of
or omitting to take any such action would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Borrower will not, and will not permit any other Loan Party to, amend,
modify or supplement any Operative Agreement or its partnership agreement,
certificate of incorporation or by-laws without the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders; provided, that (i) the MLP Agreement and the Partnership
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior written
consent of the Required Lenders if such amendment, modification or supplement
would not have a Material Adverse Effect and the Borrower shall have delivered
to each Lender a copy of such proposed amendment, modification or supplement
together with an Officer's Certificate describing such proposed amendment,
modification or supplement and confirming that such proposed amendment,
modification or supplement would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) the
Note Agreements may be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior
written consent of the Required Lenders if such amendment, modification or
supplement may be made without the written consent of any Lenders under the
Intercreditor Agreement.

     Section 6.13 Chief Executive Office. The Borrower will not move its chief
executive office and the office at which it maintains its records relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents or
change its state of incorporation unless (a) not less than 45 days' prior
written notice of its intention to do so, clearly describing the new location or
state, shall have been given to the Trustee and each Lender and (b) such action,
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and each Lender, to maintain any security
interest in the property subject to the Collateral Documents at all times fully
perfected and in full force and effect shall have been taken.

     Section 6.14 Covenant to Secure Notes Equally. The Borrower covenants that,
if it or any Restricted Subsidiary shall create or assume any Lien upon any of
its property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than
Liens permitted by the provisions of Section 6.02 (unless prior written consent
to the creation or assumption thereof shall have been obtained from the Required
Lenders), it will make or cause to be made effective provision whereby the
Facility Obligations will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with any
and

<PAGE>

                                                                              95

all other Indebtedness thereby secured so long as any such other Indebtedness
shall be so secured; provided, however, that the provision of such equal and
ratable security shall not constitute a cure or waiver of any related Event of
Default.

     Section 6.15 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and
orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, the United States of
America, foreign countries, states, provinces and municipalities, and of or by
any Governmental Authority, including any court, arbitrator or grand jury, in
respect of the conduct of their respective businesses and the ownership of their
respective properties or business (including, without limitation, Environmental
Laws), except such as are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings promptly initiated and diligently conducted and if such reserve or
other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required by GAAP shall have
been made therefor or the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 6.16 Further Assurances. (a) At any time and from time to time
promptly, the Borrower shall, at its expense, execute and deliver to each Lender
and to the Trustee such further instruments and documents, and take such further
action, as may be required under applicable law or as the Lenders may from time
to time reasonably request, in order to further carry out the intent and purpose
of this Agreement and to establish and protect the rights, interests and
remedies created, or intended to be created, in favor of the Lenders.

     (b) Without limitation of Section 6.16(a), the Borrower will, and will
cause the Subsidiaries to, perform any and all acts and execute any and all
documents (including the execution, amendment, supplementation, delivery and
recordation and filing of security agreements and financing statements and
continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable
jurisdiction) for filing under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and
the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other statute, rule or regulation
of any applicable foreign, Federal, state or local jurisdictions, including any
filings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or similar foreign
office, which are necessary (or reasonably requested by the Agents), from time
to time, in order to grant and maintain in favor of the Trustee for the ratable
benefit of the Secured Parties a security interest in each item of the
Collateral of the type and priority described in the relevant Collateral
Document, perfected to the extent contemplated hereby and thereby.

     (c) Without limitation of Section 6.16(a), the Borrower will, and will
cause the Subsidiaries to, deliver or cause to be delivered to the Lenders from
time to time such other documentation, consents, authorizations, approvals and
orders in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, as the Agents shall
deem reasonably necessary or advisable to perfect or maintain the Liens for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, including assets which are required to become
Collateral after the Closing Date.

     Section 6.17 Subsidiaries. (a) The Borrower may designate any Restricted
Subsidiary or newly acquired or formed Wholly Owned Subsidiary satisfying the
requirements in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the definition of Restricted

     designation no condition or event shall exist which constitutes an Event of
     Default or Default;

               (ii) immediately after giving effect to such designation, (A)
     except in the case of a designation as a Restricted Subsidiary of an
     Unrestricted Subsidiary that does not have any Indebtedness the Borrower

     compliance with paragraphs (i) and (ii) of Section 6.01(e), (B) the
     Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiary would not be liable with respect to

     Agreement and (C) substantially all of the Borrower's assets will be
     located, and substantially all of the Borrower's business will be
     conducted, in the United States;

               (iii) in the case of a designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary,
     (A) if such designation (and all other prior designations of Restricted
     Subsidiaries or newly acquired or formed Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
     Subsidiaries during the current fiscal year) were deemed to constitute a
     sale by the Borrower of all the assets of the Subsidiary so designated,
     such sale would be in compliance with paragraph (iii)(A) or Section 6.07(c)
     and (B) if such designation (and all other prior designations of Restricted
     Subsidiaries or newly acquired or formed Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
     Subsidiaries during the current fiscal year) were deemed to constitute an

     on the date of such designation;

               (viii) the Borrower shall designate Star/Petro as a Restricted

     6.17(a), shall not change such designation without the consent of the
     Required Lenders; and

               (ix) the Borrower shall designate Petro Holdings as an

     Section 6.20 Certain Real Property. Without affecting the obligations of
the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under any of the Collateral
Documents, in the event that the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, at any
time after the date hereof, whether directly or indirectly, acquires any
interest in any real property, including any fee or other ownership interest in
one or more properties with an aggregate cost in excess of $50,000, or any
interest under one or more leases of real property for a term in excess of three
years and involving aggregate average payments in excess of $100,000 per annum
(each such interest, an "After Acquired Property"), the Borrower will, or will
cause such Restricted Subsidiary to, as soon as practical provide written notice
thereof to the Administrative Agent, setting forth with specificity a
description of such After Acquired Property, the location of such After Acquired
Property, any structures or improvements thereon and an appraisal or its
good-faith estimate of the current value of such real property ("Current
Value"). The Administrative Agent shall provide notice to the Borrower of
whether the Required Lenders intend to cause the Borrower to grant and record a
Mortgage on such After Acquired Property; provided, that no new mortgage on such
After Acquired Property shall be required if the costs that would be incurred as
a result thereof are excessive in relation to the benefits conferred thereby in
the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders;
provided, further, that the amount secured by a new mortgage on After Acquired
Property located in the State of New York or the State of Florida shall not

Agent a Mortgage, together with such of the documents or instruments referred to
in Sections 4.01(d) and 4.01(e) as the Agents shall require. If, at any time,
the aggregate cost to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries of each
interest in real property (x) acquired by the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary, whether directly or indirectly, at any time after the Closing Date,
at a cost equal to or less than $50,000, (y) at such time, owned directly or
indirectly by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary and (z) for which a
mortgage in favor of the Trustee is not in effect (the "Aggregate Cost of
Unmortgaged Property"), exceeds $500,000, the Borrower will as soon as
practical, and in any event within 10 Business Days, provide written notice
thereof to the Administrative Agent, setting forth with specificity a
description of each such interest in real property, the location of such real
property and an appraisal or its good-faith estimate of the current value of
each such real property. The Administrative Agent may require the Borrower or
the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to grant and record a mortgage in favor of
the Trustee on one or more of such real properties so that the Aggregate Cost of
Unmortgaged Property does not exceed $500,000, provided, that no new mortgage on
any such real property shall be required if the costs that would be incurred as
a result thereof are excessive in relation to the benefit that would be
conferred thereby. In the event a mortgage is required, the Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a mortgage,
together with such documents or instruments as the Administrative Agent shall
require. In no event shall the title insurance policy for any such After
Acquired Property be in an amount which is less than the Current Value of such
After Acquired Property. Further, with regard to any interest in real property,
including any fee or other ownership interest in real property or any material
lease of real property, currently owned or held by the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary and which is not being encumbered by a Mortgage of even
date herewith (each such interest, an "Existing Unmortgaged Property"), upon the
written request of the Required Lenders, the Borrower will, or will cause any
applicable Restricted Subsidiary to, execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent a Mortgage, together with such of the documents or instruments referred to
in Section 4.01(d) and 4.01(e) as the Agents shall require. In no event shall
the title insurance policy for any such Existing Unmortgaged Property be in an
amount which is less than the Current Value of such Existing Unmortgaged
Property. The Borrower shall pay all fees and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses and expenses of any customary environmental due
diligence, and all title insurance charges and premiums, in connection with the
obligations of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries under this Section
6.20.

     Section 6.21 Sale and Lease-Back Transactions. The Borrower will not, and
will not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any
arrangement, directly or indirectly, with any Person whereby it shall sell or
transfer any property, real or personal, used or useful in its business, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, with an intent to rent or lease such property
or other property which it intends to use for substantially the same purpose or
purposes as the property being sold or transferred.

     Section 6.22 Acquisitions. Except as permitted by Section 6.07, the
Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted

                                                                              99

and is continuing at the time of any such acquisition or would occur immediately
after giving effect thereto.

     Section 6.23 Impairment of Security Interests. The Borrower will not, and
will not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, take or omit to take any action,
which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing
the security interests in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties
with respect to the Collateral, and the Borrower will not, and will not permit
any of the Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person (other than the Trustee on
behalf of the Secured Parties) any interest whatsoever in the Collateral.

     Section 6.24 Limitation on Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends, etc. The
Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends or make any other
distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock, or pay any indebtedness
owed to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, (b) make loans or advances to
the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its properties
or assets to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, except for such
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) customary
non-assignment provisions in any lease governing a leasehold interest or other
contract entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices or (ii) this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Note
Agreements.

     Section 6.25 No Other Negative Pledges. The Borrower will not, and will not
cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into any agreement prohibiting the creation or assumption of any Lien upon
the properties or assets of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, or requiring an obligation to be secured if
some other obligation is secured, except for this Agreement, the Note Agreements
and the Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement.

     Section 6.26 Sales of Receivables. The Borrower will not, and will not
cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, sell with recourse,
discount or otherwise sell or dispose of its notes or accounts receivable,
except for accounts receivable consisting of assets of an operating unit sold as
a going concern in accordance with all other provisions of this Agreement.

     Section 6.27 Fixed Price Supply Contracts; Certain Policies. (a) The
Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, at
any time be a party or subject to any contract for the purchase or supply by
such parties of propane or other product except where (i) the purchase price is
set with reference to a spot index or indices substantially contemporaneously
with the delivery of such product or (ii) delivery of such propane or other
product is to be made no more than one year after the purchase price is agreed
to.

     (b) The Borrower will not amend, modify or waive the trading policy or
supply inventory position policy referred to in Section 3.29, except that the
Borrower may enter into Commodity Hedging Agreements as permitted under the
other provisions hereof. The Borrower will provide the Agents and the Lenders
with prompt written notice of any such new Commodity Hedging Agreement. Subject
to the foregoing exception, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries will
comply in all material respects with such policies at all times.

     Section 6.28 Certain Operations. The Borrower shall not permit Petro or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries) to
acquire a business which derives any revenues from the sale of propane if, after
giving effect to such acquisition, Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes (as defined
below) would equal or exceed the lesser of (a) 15% of the Borrower's reported
propane volumes sold for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters which
ended at least 90 days prior to the date of such acquisition and (b) 15 million
gallons of propane (such lesser amount, the "maximum permitted amount"). If as a
result of an acquisition, Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes exceeds the maximum
permitted amount, the Borrower shall not be in violation of this Section 6.28 if
within the period of 90 days following such acquisition the Borrower causes
Petro to complete the disposition of sufficient propane volume to reduce Petro's
Pro Forma Propane Volumes below the maximum permitted amount. For purposes of
this Section 6.28, "Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes" shall mean the actual
propane volumes sold by Petro and any of its Affiliates (other than the Borrower
and the Restricted Subsidiaries) for the most recently completed four fiscal
quarters which ended at least 90 days prior to the date of determination plus
the propane volumes sold of the propane business to be acquired for the most
recently completed four fiscal quarters which ended at least 90 days prior to
the date of determination. In addition, in the event Petro or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries) owns a
propane business, the Borrower shall not permit Petro or any such Affiliate to
accept as a customer (except for de minimis, unintentional and isolated
acceptances) any Person who is (or was during the last billing cycle of the
Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries) a customer of the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries.

     Section 6.29 Independent Corporate Existence. (a) Except as set forth on
Schedule 6.29, the Borrower shall maintain, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries) to maintain, books,
records and accounts that are separate from the books, records and accounts of
Petro or any of its Subsidiaries such that: (i) the revenues of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries will be credited to the accounts of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries only; (ii) all expenses incurred by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall be paid only from the accounts of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (other than those paid by Petro and allocated to the Borrower in
the manner set forth in clause (c) of this Section); (iii) only officers and
employees of the General Partner, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in their
capacity as such shall have the authority to make disbursements with respect to
the accounts of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; (iv) there shall occur no
sharing of accounts or funds between the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Petro or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries), on the other hand; and (v) all cash and funds of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries shall be managed separately from the cash and funds of Petro or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower and its Subsidiaries), and

funds or assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with the funds or assets of
Petro or any of its Subsidiaries.

     (b) All full-time employees, consultants and agents of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries) shall be
compensated directly from the bank accounts of the General Partner, the Borrower
and such Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries) for
services provided by such employees, consultants and agents and, to the extent
any employee, consultant or agent is also an employee, consultant or agent of
Petro or any of its Subsidiaries, the compensation of such employee, consultant
or agent shall be

allocated in accordance with clause (c) of this Section among the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Petro and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, on a basis which reasonably reflects the services rendered to the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries).

     (c) All overhead expenses (including telephone and other utility charges)
for items shared by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Petro or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be allocated on the basis of actual use
to the extent practicable and, to the extent such allocation is not practicable,
on a basis reasonably related to actual use.

     (d) The Borrower shall not permit Petro or any of its Subsidiaries to be
named as a loss payee or additional insured on the insurance policy covering the
property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings
or its Subsidiaries), or enter into an agreement with the holder of such policy
whereby in the event of a loss in connection with such property, proceeds are
paid to Petro and its Subsidiaries.

other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrower, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding; (iii) require the Borrower to deposit cash collateral
with the Trustee pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement in an amount not
exceeding the Letter of Credit Exposure; (iv) exercise any remedies available

Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid
accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrower accrued hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, shall automatically become due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein or
in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

     Section 7.02 Remedies. In case any one or more Events of Default or
Defaults shall occur and be continuing, (i) any Lender may proceed to protect
and enforce the rights of such Lender by an action at law, suit in equity or
other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any
agreement contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or for an injunction
against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise, and (ii)
the Trustee and the Lenders may exercise any rights or remedies in their
respective capacities under the Collateral Documents in accordance with the
provisions thereof. In case of a default in the payment or performance of any
provision hereof or of the Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay to each Lender
such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the cost and expenses of
collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements,
and any out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any such holder incurred in
connection with analyzing, evaluating, protecting, ascertaining, defending or
enforcing any of its rights as set forth herein or in any of the Loan Documents.
No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any Lender in exercising any
right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice
such Lender's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by
this Agreement or by any other Loan Document upon any Lender shall be exclusive
of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or
hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                           THE AGENTS AND ISSUING BANK

     Section 8.01 Appointment and Authorization. (a) Each of the Lenders, and
each subsequent holder of any Note by its acceptance thereof, hereby irrevocably
appoints and authorizes each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank to take such
actions as agent on behalf of such Lender or holder and to exercise such powers
as are specifically delegated to such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, by the terms and provisions hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither the Agents nor the Issuing Bank shall have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agents or
the Issuing Bank.

     (b) The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders
to, without hereby limiting any implied authority, and hereby agrees (in the
case of clause (ii) below, at the direction of the Required Lenders) to, (i)
receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on
the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to
distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (ii)
give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Borrower of any Event of
Default specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual
knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (iii) distribute
to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials
delivered by the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document as received by the Administrative Agent (other than
materials required hereunder to be delivered by the Borrower directly to the
Lenders).

     Section 8.02 Liability of Agents. Neither the Agents, the Issuing Bank, nor
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys-in-fact,
affiliates or agents, shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted to
be taken by any of them in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, except for such party's own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as
found by a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction), or be responsible for any statement, warranty, recital or
representation herein or the contents of any document delivered in connection
herewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any inquiry concerning the
performance or observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of the terms,
conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan Document. Neither the
Agents nor the Issuing Bank shall be responsible to the Lenders or the holders
of the Notes for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or
effectiveness of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents or other
instruments or agreements. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have
received from the payee of such Note notice, given as provided herein, of the
transfer thereof in compliance with Section 9.04. Each of the Agents, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement,
order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank shall be fully justified
in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Neither the Agents, the
Issuing Bank nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
agents, shall have any responsibility to the Borrower on account of the failure
of or delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its obligations
hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance
or breach by any other Lender or the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of their
respective obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in
connection herewith or therewith. Each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank may
execute any and all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees, shall be
entitled to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other
experts selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder and shall
not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. None of
Lenders identified in this Agreement as a "Documentation Agent" or "Syndication
Agent" shall have any obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
Agreement in such capacity other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of Lenders so identified as "Documentation
Agent" or "Syndication Agent" shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that is has not relied,
and will not rely, on any of Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into
this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

     Section 8.03 Action by Agents. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that none of
the Agents and the Issuing Bank shall be under any duty to take any
discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing

<PAGE>

                                                                             107

to do so by the Required Lenders. The obligations of the Agents and the Issuing
Bank under the Loan Documents are only those expressly set forth herein and
therein.

     Section 8.04 Notice of Default. Except for actual knowledge of non-payment,
the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent
has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if
so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

     Section 8.05 Successor Agents. The Administrative Agent and the Issuing
Bank (except, in the case of the Issuing Bank, in respect of Letters of Credit
issued by it) may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint
from among the Lenders a successor, whereupon such successor shall succeed to
the rights, powers and duties of either the Administrative Agent or Issuing
Bank, and the term "Administrative Agent" or "Issuing Bank" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank's rights, powers and duties as
Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent, Issuing
Bank or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have
accepted such appointment, within 10 days after the retiring Agent or Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent's or Issuing Bank's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective, and the retiring Administrative Agent or Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor,
which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the
United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital
and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank and the retiring Administrative
Agent or Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section
9.05 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent or
Issuing Bank.

     Section 8.06 Agent and Affiliate. With respect to the Loans made by it
hereunder, the Letters of Credit issued by it hereunder and the Notes issued to
it, each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank in its individual capacity and not
as an Agent or the Issuing Bank shall have the same rights and powers as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent or the
Issuing Bank. The term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its

<PAGE>

                                                                             108

individual capacity. Each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank (and its
Affiliates) may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of business and transactions with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent or the Issuing Bank (or such
Affiliate thereof).

     Section 8.07 Indemnification. Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse each of
the Agents and the Issuing Bank, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata share
(based on its Commitment hereunder) of any expenses incurred for the benefit of
the Lenders by such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, including
counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered
on behalf of the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower
and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys-in-fact,
affiliates or agents, promptly after demand, in the amount of such pro rata
share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against it in its capacity as an Agent or the Issuing Bank or any
of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, any documents contemplated by or referred herein or therein, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by it
or any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent
the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower; provided, that no
Lender shall be liable to any Agent or the Issuing Bank for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Agent or the Issuing Bank (as found by a final and
non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction).

     Section 8.08 Credit Decision. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that
neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will independently and without reliance upon the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Agents hereunder, the Agents shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Agents or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

     Section 8.09 Intercreditor Agreement. The Lenders hereby authorize and
agree to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and authorize the
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, to execute the Agreement of
Parity Lenders and Supplement to Intercreditor Agreement.

                    For the purposes of this Section 9.04, the terms "Approved
          Fund" has the following meaning:

                    "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural
               person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or
               investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the
               ordinary course of its business and that is administered or
               managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a

<PAGE>

                                                                             113

               Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that
               administers or manages a Lender.

               (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
     paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in
     each Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party
     hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
     Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
     Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
     interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
     obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
     Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
     shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.15, 2.19
     and 9.05). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
     under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be
     treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
     participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph
     (c) of this Section.

               (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
     agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
     Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
     recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments
     of, and principal amount of the Loans and Letter of Credit Exposure owing
     to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
     "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
     Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may
     treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
     terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
     notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
     inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any
     reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

               (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
     Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's
     completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already
     be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in
     paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
     required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall
     accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained
     therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of
     this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in
     this paragraph.

     (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the
Loans owing to it); provided, that (A) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this

<PAGE>

                                                                             114

Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided, that such agreement may provide that such Lender
will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to Section 9.08(b) and (2) directly
affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 2.19 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender, provided, that such
Participant shall be subject to Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.

               (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
     payment under Section 2.13, 2.14 or 2.19 than the applicable Lender would
     have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
     such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant
     is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. Any Participant that is
     a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.19
     unless such Participant complies with Section 2.19(d).

     (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment
of a security interest; provided, that no such pledge or assignment of a
security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     (e) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender,
agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions
of the type described in paragraph (d) above.

     (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all
of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the
consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without regard to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.04(b). Each of the Borrower, each Lender and
the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a
Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender
any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day
after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by
such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit
Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party
hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to
institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of
forbearance.

     Section 9.05 Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay (whether
or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated) all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Agent or the Issuing Bank in
connection with the preparation,

<PAGE>

                                                                             115

execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the
closing of the Facility, the administration of the Facility or any amendment,
modification or waiver of the provisions hereof or thereof or incurred by any
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in connection with the enforcement or
protection of the rights of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with the Loans made
hereunder, the Notes issued hereunder or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of (i) Simpson Thacher
& Bartlett LLP, counsel to the Administrative Agent, (ii) any third party
consultants retained to assist the Agents in analyzing any environmental,
insurance and other due diligence issues, (iii) any search and filing fees of
any company acceptable to the Lenders and (iv) in connection with any such
enforcement or protection, any other counsel for any Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender.

     (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank,
the affiliates of any Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders, and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and Controlling Persons (each, an
"Indemnified Party") from and against any and all losses, claims (whether valid
or not), damages and liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified
Party may become subject, related to or arising out of (i) the Facility and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) the execution or delivery of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto
of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (iii) the use of the
Letters of Credit or the proceeds of the Loans or (iv) any claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any
Indemnified Party is a party thereto. The Borrower further agrees to reimburse
each Indemnified Party for all expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of,
preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or
proceeding arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation to
indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Section 9.05(b) shall not apply in
respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final and nonappealable judgment
that such loss, claim, damage or liability resulted from such Indemnified
Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank,
the Lenders and the other Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
losses, claims (whether valid or not), damages and liabilities, joint or
several, to which such Indemnified Party may become subject, related to or
arising out of (i) any Environmental Laws affecting the Borrower or any other
Loan Party or its properties or assets, (ii) any Hazardous Materials managed by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party, (iii) any event, condition or circumstance
involving environmental pollution, regulation or control affecting the Borrower
or any other Loan Party or its properties or assets or (iv) any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party thereto. The Borrower further
agrees to reimburse each Indemnified Party for all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with
the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened
claim or any action or proceeding arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Section
9.05(c) shall not apply in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final
and nonappealable judgment that

<PAGE>

                                                                             116

such loss, claim, damage or liability resulted from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     (d) In the event that the foregoing indemnity is unavailable or
insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then the Borrower will
contribute to amounts paid or payable by such Indemnified Party in respect of
such Indemnified Party's losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such
proportions as appropriately reflect the relative benefits received by and fault
of the Borrower and such Indemnified Party in connection with the matters as to
which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate and other equitable
considerations.

     (e) If any action, proceeding or investigation is commenced, as to which
any Indemnified Party proposes to demand such indemnification, it shall notify
the Borrower with reasonable promptness; provided, however, that any failure by
such Indemnified Party to notify the Borrower shall not relieve the Borrower
from its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Borrower is prejudiced
thereby. The Borrower shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such
action, proceeding or investigation, including the employment of counsel and the
payment of all fees and expenses. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in connection with any such action, proceeding or
investigation and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, unless (i) the
Borrower has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel as provided herein,
(ii) the Borrower has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses of
separate counsel or (iii) an action, proceeding or investigation has been
commenced against such Indemnified Party and the Borrower and representation of
both the Borrower and such Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be
inappropriate because of actual or potential conflicts of interest between the
parties (in the case of any Agent or Lender, the existence of any such actual or
potential conflict of interest to be determined by such party, taking into
account, among other things, any relevant regulatory concerns). In the case of
any circumstance described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the Borrower shall be responsible for the reasonable fees
and expenses of such separate counsel; provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not in any event be required to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
separate counsel (plus appropriate local counsel under the direction of such
separate counsel) for all Indemnified Parties. The Borrower shall be liable only
for settlement of any claim against an Indemnified Party made with the
Borrower's written consent.

     (f) The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full
force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of
the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf
of any Agent or Lender. All amounts due under this Section 9.05 shall be payable
on written demand therefor.

     Section 9.06 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of
the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents

<PAGE>

                                                                             117

held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made
any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section 9.06
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

     Section 9.07 Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     Section 9.08 Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of any Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 9.08(b), and
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case
shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances.

     (b) None of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any provision
hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified, except pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment or modification shall
(i) decrease the principal amount of any Loan, extend the Maturity Date or the
Conversion Date, extend any Repayment Date or any date for the payment of any
interest on any Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof,
or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan, without the prior written consent
of each holder of a Note affected thereby, (ii) increase or extend the
Commitment or decrease the Commitment Fees or Letter of Credit Fees of any
Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender, (iii) postpone the date
fixed for any reimbursement of a Letter of Credit Disbursement without the prior
written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) permit the release of any
material amount of Collateral under any Collateral Document or permit the
release of any material guarantor from the Guarantee Agreements without the
prior written consent of each Lender, (v) increase the aggregate Commitments of
the Lenders without the prior written consent of each Lender, (vi) amend or
modify the provisions of Section 2.01(b) or waive the conditions set forth
therein, the provisions of Section 2.11(f), the provisions of Section 2.16, the
provisions of Sections 9.04(a)(i), 9.04(b)(ii)(B), or any of the provisions of
Article II relating to the pro rata treatment between this Agreement and the
Working Capital and Acquisition Facility Credit Agreement, the provisions of
this Section 9.08 or the definition of "Required Lenders" or otherwise change
the percentage of the Commitments, the percentage of the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Notes or the number of Lenders which shall be required
for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of each
Lender; provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or
otherwise affect the rights or duties of any Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder
without the prior written consent of such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as

<PAGE>

                                                                             118

applicable. Each Lender and each holder of a Note shall be bound by any waiver,
amendment or modification authorized by this Section 9.08 regardless of whether
its Note shall have been marked to make reference thereto, and any consent by
any Lender or holder of a Note pursuant to this Section 9.08 shall bind any
Person subsequently acquiring a Note from it, whether or not such Note shall
have been so marked.

     (c) In the event that any waiver, amendment or modification requires the
prior written consent of each Lender pursuant to Section 9.08(b), and the
Borrower has obtained the approval of all but one Lender, the Borrower shall
have the right to replace such non-consenting Lender; provided that, (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement,
(iii) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans
and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of
replacement, (iv) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under
Section 2.15 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be
purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto,
(v) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vi) the replaced Lender
shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.04(b) (provided that, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
registration and processing fee referred to therein) and (vii) any such
replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced
Lender.

     Section 9.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein or
in the Notes to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate,
together with all fees and charges which are treated as interest under
applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), as provided for herein or in any
other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for,
charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate
of interest payable under the affected Note held by such Lender, together with
all Charges payable to such Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

     Section 9.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
the other Operative Agreements and the Letter Agreement constitute the entire
contract among the parties relative to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
Any agreement previously entered into among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof is superseded by this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements and the Letter Agreement. Nothing
in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements or
the Letter Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
party, other than the parties hereto and the other Secured Parties, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements or the Letter Agreement.

     Section 9.11 Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall

<PAGE>

                                                                             119

endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

     Section 9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when
taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as
provided in Section 9.03.

     Section 9.13 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

     Section 9.14 Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of Jury
Trial. (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York, New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring
any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any
New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
New York, New York. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

     (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

     (d) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE
BORROWER, THE LENDERS, THE AGENTS AND THE ISSUING BANK HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
