to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code (or any successor
provision or similar excise tax), or any interest or penalties are incurred by
the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with
any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as

(C) hereof were each reduced by up to 20 percent, then the payments set forth
in Section 8(d)(iii)(B) and (C) will each be reduced to the smallest extent
possible (and in no event by more than 20 percent in the aggregate) such that
no Payment is subject to the Excise Tax.</FONT></P>

Payment, shall be made by a nationally recognized independent public accounting
firm selected by the Company (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;) which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within
15&nbsp;business days of the date of termination of the Executive&#146;s employment,
if applicable, or such earlier time as is reasonably requested. The initial
Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9(c),
shall be paid to the Executive within five business days of the receipt of the
Accounting Firm&#146;s determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no
Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it shall furnish the Executive with a
written opinion that he has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax
on his Federal income tax return. Any determination by the Accounting Firm
meeting the requirements of this Section&nbsp;9(c) shall be binding upon the
Company and the Executive, subject only to payments pursuant to the following
sentence based on a determination that additional Gross-Up Payments should have
been made, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder (the
amount of such additional payments are referred to herein as the <U>`Gross-Up
Underpayment</U>&#148;). In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies
pursuant to Section&nbsp;9(d) and the Executive thereafter is required to make
a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of
the Gross-Up Underpayment that has occurred and any such Gross-Up Underpayment
shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Company.</FONT></P>

The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the United
States Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment

but not later than 30&nbsp;business days after the Executive receives written
notice of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim
and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall
not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the
date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period
ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is
due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration
of such period that it desires, in good faith, to contest such claim (which
notice shall set forth the bases for such contest) and that it will bear the
costs and provide the indemnification as required by this sentence, the

Any dispute between the Parties arising from or relating to the terms of this
Agreement or the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company or its Affiliates shall,

Executive agrees that the Company and its Affiliates will be entitled, in
addition to any other available remedies, to obtain injunctive relief against
any breach or prospective breach by Executive of his obligations under
Section&nbsp;11 or 12 in any Federal or state court sitting in the City and
State of New York or court sitting in Bermuda or the United Kingdom, or, at the

dispute with respect thereto is continuing; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Executive may elect
to resolve any dispute involving a breach or alleged breach of this Agreement
following termination of the Executive&#146;s employment during a Post-Change Period
in any Federal or State court sitting in the City and State of New York or
court sitting in Bermuda or the United Kingdom. The Company hereby submits to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of all those courts for the purposes of any such
actions or proceedings instituted by the Executive, and the Company agrees that
process in any or all of such actions or proceedings may be served by
registered mail or delivery, addressed to the Company as set forth in
Section&nbsp;20, or in any other manner authorized by law. The Company shall
pay all costs associated with any court proceeding under this
Section&nbsp;18(c) without regard to the outcome of such proceeding, including
all legal fees and expenses of the Executive, who shall be reimbursed for all
such costs within 30&nbsp;days following written demand therefor by the Executive
(which written demand shall be made no later than six (6) months following the
end of the calendar year in which such costs were incurred).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
Each Party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with any proceeding
under Sections&nbsp;18(a) or 18(b) hereof, including all legal fees and
expenses; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Company shall bear all such
costs of the Executive (to the extent such costs are reasonable) if the
Executive substantially prevails in the proceeding. Following the final
determination of the dispute in which the Executive has substantially
prevailed, the Company shall reimburse all such reasonable costs within
30&nbsp;days following written demand therefore (supported by documentation of
such costs) by the Executive, and the Executive shall make such written demand
within 60&nbsp;days following the final determination of the dispute: provided,
however, that such payment shall be made no later than on or prior to the end
of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the cost is incurred.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a final determination of the
dispute has not been made by December&nbsp;1 of the year following the calendar
year in which the cost is incurred, the Company shall, within 30&nbsp;days
after such December&nbsp;1, reimburse such reasonable costs (supported by
documentation of such costs) incurred in the prior taxable year; provided,
however, that the Executive shall return such amounts to the Company within ten
(10) business days following the final determination if the Executive did not
substantially prevail in the dispute.</FONT></P>

<U>GOVERNING LAW</U>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York without reference to the principles of
conflict of laws.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.
<U>SECTION&nbsp;409A</U>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
The intent of the Parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement
comply with Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;409A and the regulations and
guidance promulgated there under (collectively &#147;<U>Code Section&nbsp;409A</U>&#148;)
and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be
interpreted to be in compliance therewith. If the Executive notifies the
Company (with specificity as to the reason therefor) that the Executive
believes that any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation,
including equity compensation or benefits) would cause the Executive to incur
any additional tax or interest under Code Section&nbsp;409A and the Company
concurs with such belief or the Company (without any obligation whatsoever to
do so) independently makes such determination, the Company shall, after
consulting with the Executive, reform such provision to attempt to comply with
Code Section&nbsp;409A through good faith modifications to the minimum extent
reasonably appropriate to conform with Code Section&nbsp;409A. To the extent
that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with Code
Section&nbsp;409A, such modification shall be made in good faith and shall, to
the maximum extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and
economic benefit/burden to the Executive and the Company of the applicable
provision without violating the provisions of Code Section&nbsp;409A.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes
of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or
benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination
is also a &#147;separation from service&#148; within the meaning of Code
Section&nbsp;409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement,
references to a &#147;termination,&#148; &#147;termination of employment&#148; or like terms shall
mean &#147;separation from service.&#148; If the Executive is deemed on the date of
termination to be a &#147;specified employee&#148; within the meaning of that term under
Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment that is considered
deferred compensation under Code Section&nbsp;409A payable on account of a
&#147;separation from service,&#148; such payment or benefit shall be made or provided at
the date which is the earlier of (<U>i</U>)&nbsp;the expiration of the six

Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;26(b) (whether they would have otherwise been
payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall
be paid or reimbursed to the Executive in a lump sum with interest at the prime
rate as published in <U>The Wall Street Journal</U> on the first business day
of the Delay Period, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this
Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates
specified for them herein.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of costs
and expenses or in-kind benefits, except as permitted by Code
Section&nbsp;409A, (<U>i</U>)&nbsp;the right to reimbursement or in-kind
benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, (<U>ii</U>)&nbsp;the
amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits, provided
during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for
reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year,
provided that the foregoing clause&nbsp;(ii) shall not be violated without
regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Code
Section&nbsp;105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related
to the period the arrangement is in effect and (<U>iii</U>)&nbsp;such payments
shall be made on or before the last day of the Executive&#146;s taxable year
following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with
reference to a number of days (e.g., &#147;payment shall be made within thirty (30)
days after termination of employment&#148;), the actual date of payment within the
specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)(i)
The Company shall indemnify the Executive, as provided in this subsection (e),
if the Executive incurs additional tax under Code Section 409A as a result of a
violation of Code Section 409A (each an &#147;<U>Indemnified Code Section 409A
Violation</U>&#148;) that occurs as a result of (1) the Company&#146;s clerical error
(other than an error cause by erroneous information provided to the Company by
the Executive), (2) the Company&#146;s failure to administer this Agreement or any
benefit plan or program in accordance with its written terms (such written
terms, the &#147;<U>Plan Document</U>&#148;), or (3) following December 31, 2008, the
Company&#146;s failure to maintain the Plan Documents in compliance with Code
Section 409A; <U>provided</U>, that the indemnification set forth in clause (3)
shall not be available to the Executive if (x) the Company has made a
reasonable, good faith attempt to maintain the applicable Plan Document in
compliance with Code Section 409A but has failed to do so, or (y) the Company
has maintained the applicable Plan Document in compliance with Code Section
409A but subsequent issuance by the Internal Revenue Service or the Department
of the Treasury of interpretive authority results in the applicable Plan
Document not (or no longer) complying with Code Section 409A (except that, if
the Company is permitted by such authority or other authority to amend the Plan
Document to bring the Plan Document into </FONT></P>

then such indemnification shall be provided). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)
In the event of an Indemnified Code Section 409A Violation, the Company shall
reimburse the Executive for (1)&nbsp;the 20% additional income tax described in
Code Section 409A(a)(1)(B)(i)(II) (to the extent that the Executive incurs the
20% additional income tax as a result of the Indemnified Code Section 409A
Violation), and (2)&nbsp;any interest or penalty that is assessed with respect
to the Executive&#146;s failure to make a timely payment of the 20% additional
income tax described in clause (1), provided that the Executive pays the 20%
additional income tax promptly upon being notified that the tax is due (the
amounts described in clause (1) and clause (2) are referred to collectively as
the &#147;<U>Code Section 409A Tax</U>&#148;). In addition, in the event of an
Indemnified Code Section 409A Violation, the Company shall make a payment (the
&#147;<U>Code Section 409A Gross-Up Payment</U>&#148;) to the Executive such that the net
amount the Executive retains, after paying any federal, state, or local income
tax or FICA tax on the Code Section 409A Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to
the Code Section 409A Tax. The procedures set forth in Section 9(c) and 9(d)
with respect to the Gross-Up Payment shall also apply to the payment of the
Code Section 409A Tax and the Code Section 409A Gross-Up Payment (including,
without limitation, the Company&#146;s right to contest the Code Section 409A Tax); <U>provided</U>,
that, in addition to such procedures, the Executive shall reasonably cooperate
with measures identified by the Company that are intended to mitigate the Code
Section 409A Tax to the extent that such measures do not materially reduce or
delay the payments and benefits to the Executive hereunder.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)
Any payment made by the Company in respect of any taxes imposed with regard to
the Company&#146;s obligation to provide benefits in lieu of continued medical plan
coverage shall be paid to the Executive, his dependents or the applicable
taxing authority on their behalf, no later than the due date of such taxes.</FONT></P>
