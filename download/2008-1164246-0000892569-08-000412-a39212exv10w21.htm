(a)&nbsp;perform environmental assessments; (b)&nbsp;to provide Appraisals; and (c)&nbsp;perform such other
services as may, from time to time, be reasonably required by Lender. This obligation on the part
of Borrower shall survive the closing of the Loan and the repayment thereof.

expenses, charges, costs and fees provided for in this Agreement or relating to the Loan or the
Project, including, without limitation, any fees incurred for recording or filing any of the Loan
Documents, title insurance premiums and charges, tax service contract fees, fees of any
consultants, Lender&#146;s processing and closing fees, Lender&#146;s inspection fees, reasonable fees and
expenses of Lender&#146;s counsel (and any counsel to any assignee of Lender to which the Loan Documents
are pledged as security), printing, photostating and duplicating expenses, air freight charges,
escrow fees, costs of surveys, premiums of hazard insurance policies and surety bonds and fees for
any appraisal, appraisal review, market or feasibility study required by Lender. Borrower hereby
authorizes Lender to disburse the proceeds of the Loan to pay such expenses, charges, costs and
fees notwithstanding that Borrower may not have requested a disbursement of such amount. Such
disbursement shall be added to the outstanding principal balance of the Note. The authorization
hereby granted shall be irrevocable, and no further direction or authorization from Borrower shall
be necessary for Lender to make such disbursements. However, the provision of this Section&nbsp;12.10
shall not prevent Borrower from paying such expense, charges, costs and fees from its own funds.
All such expenses, charges, costs and fees shall be Borrower&#146;s obligation regardless of whether or
not Borrower has requested and met the conditions for a disbursement of the Loan. The obligations
on the part of Borrower under this Section&nbsp;12.10 shall survive the closing of the Loan and the
repayment thereof.

subcontractor, supplier, laborer, architect, engineer or any other party for services performed or
materials supplied in connection with the Project. Lender shall not be liable for any debts or
claims accruing in favor of any such parties against Borrowers or others or against the Property or
the Project. Borrower is not and shall not be an agent of Lender for any purpose. Lender is not a
joint venture partner with Borrower in any manner whatsoever. Prior to default by Borrower under
this Agreement and the exercise of remedies granted herein, Lender shall not be deemed to be in
privity of contract with any contractor or provider of services to the Project, nor shall any
payment of funds directly to a contractor, subcontractor, or provider of services be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary status or recognition of same by Lender. Approvals granted by
Lender for any matters covered under this Agreement shall be narrowly construed to cover only the
parties and facts identified in any written approval or, if not in writing, such approvals shall be
solely for the benefit of Borrower.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.27 <U>Swap Contracts</U>. Borrower may enter into Swap Contracts with Lender (or its
Affiliates), or with another financial institution acceptable to Lender, for the purpose of hedging
and protecting against interest rate fluctuation risks with respect to the Loan, on such terms and
conditions as are mutually approved by Borrower and Lender (or its Affiliates). So long as any
Mortgage encumbers the Project and the Swap Contract has been provided by Lender (or its
Affiliates) in connection with the Loan, Borrower&#146;s obligations (including any payment obligations)
with respect to any such Swap Contract shall be secured by the Deeds of Trust and any other
Collateral, and any default by Borrower under any such Swap Contract shall, at the discretion of
Lender, constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement. All Swap Contracts, if any, between
Borrower and Lender (or its Affiliates) are independent Agreements governed by the written
provisions of the Swap Contracts, which will remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any
repayment, prepayment, acceleration, reduction, increase or change in the terms of any Notes or
other Loan Documents, except as otherwise expressly provided in the written Swap Contracts, and any
payoff statement from Lender relating to the Note shall not apply to the Swap Contracts except as
otherwise expressly provided in such payoff statement. By its respective signature below, each
Borrower waives any right to prepay the Loan, in whole or in part, without payment of any and all
amounts specified or required under the terms of any Swap Contracts (the &#147;<B>Indemnified Amounts</B>&#148;).
Borrower acknowledges that prepayment of the Loan may result in Lender (or its Affiliates)
incurring additional losses, costs, expenses and liabilities, including lost revenues and lost
profits in connection with the Swap Contract or otherwise. Borrower therefore agrees to pay any
and all Indemnified Amounts if the Loan is prepaid, whether voluntarily or by reason of
acceleration, including acceleration upon any transfer or conveyance of any right, title or
interest in any Property giving Lender the right to accelerate the maturity of the Loan as provided
in the Loan Documents. Borrower agrees that Lender&#146;s willingness to offer the Loan to Borrower is
sufficient and independent consideration, given individual weight by Borrower, for this waiver.
Borrower understands that Lender would not offer the Loan to Borrower absent this waiver.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any obligations of Borrower
under any Swap Contracts owed to Wachovia Bank, N.A. (or any of its Affiliates) shall, at Wachovia
Bank, N.A.&#146;s (or its Affiliates&#146;) discretion, be secured pari passu with any and all indebtedness
and obligations of Borrower secured pursuant to the Loan Documents.

parties to the Loan Documents to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury
Law from time to time in effect. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not
limited to prepayment, default, demand for payment, or acceleration of the maturity of any
obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, chargeable, or received
under this Agreement, or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount

document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the Maximum Amount, any such
construction shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and shall ipso facto be
automatically reformed and the interest payable shall be automatically reduced to the Maximum
Amount, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. If Lender shall ever
receive anything of value which is characterized as interest under applicable Law and which would
apart from this provision be in excess of the Maximum Amount, an amount equal to the amount which
would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the
principal amount owing under the Loan Documents in the inverse order of its maturity and not to the
payment of interest, or refunded to Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such
amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal. The right to accelerate
maturity of the Note or any other obligations under the Loan Documents does not include the right
to accelerate any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and
does not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of acceleration. All
interest paid or agreed to be paid to shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or
extension) of such indebtedness so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does
not exceed the Maximum Amount. As used in this Section, the term &#147;<U>applicable Law</U>&#148; shall

necessary for the Lender to marshal assets in favor of any Borrower or any other Person or
