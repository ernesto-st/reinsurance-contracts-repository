                  (d)      The Borrowers will prepare a Borrowing Base Report
(each a "Borrowing Base Report") in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B which
must also be certified by the Borrowers listing for each of the Eligible
Projects (i) the applicable Deed of Trust Lien Amount, (ii) the Costs Incurred
to Date, and (iii) its status as of the most recent reporting date as a Pool A
Project within thirty (30) days after the end of each month. The Borrowing Base
Report will be based on the outcome of the requisition procedures hereinafter
described, appraisals obtained by the Administrative Agent and other information
on the Eligible Projects provided by the Borrowers or obtained by the
Administrative Agent. The Borrowing Base shall be computed based on the
Borrowing Base Report most recently prepared by the Borrowers and reviewed and
accepted by the Administrative Agent. In the event the Borrowers shall fail to
furnish other current reports or information as reasonably required by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the Financing Documents, or in the event the
Administrative Agent believes that a Borrowing Base Report is no longer
accurate, the Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion exercised
from time to time and without limiting its other rights and remedies under the
Financing Documents, upon notice to the Borrowers and the expiration of a cure
period of five (5) Banking Days, designate any Eligible Project as having no
availability under the Borrowing Base or suspend the making of or limit advances
under the Loan. The Borrowing Base shall be subject to reduction as a result of
the following events: (i) the release of an Eligible Project from the lien of
the applicable Deed of Trust, (ii) by the change of any Eligible Project's
status as a Pool A Project, as determined by the Administrative Agent quarterly,
or (iii) the change in appraised value of an Eligible Project pursuant to
Section 7.28 (Updated Appraisals). The Borrowing Base shall be subject to
increase as a result of the following events: (i) addition of Eligible Projects
or (ii) increase in the Costs Incurred to Date as determined by the
Administrative Agent at least quarterly.

                  (e)      The Borrowers shall furnish to the Administrative
Agent such schedules, certificates, lists, records, reports, information and
documents as required by the Administrative Agent from time to time so that the
Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, determine the Borrowing
Base.

                  (f)      If at any time the aggregate principal amount of the
Loan outstanding exceeds the Borrowing Base, a borrowing base deficiency
("Borrowing Base Deficiency") shall exist. Each time a Borrowing Base Deficiency
exists, the Borrowers shall within three (3) Banking Days of notice thereof from
the Administrative Agent either pay the amount and/or add Eligible Projects to
increase the Borrowing Base to an amount which is at least equal to the
aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Loan.

                  (g)      The current Borrowing Base Report is attached hereto
as EXHIBIT C.

                  (h)      This Agreement shall govern the procedures for
verification by the Administrative Agent of Costs Incurred to Date on each
Eligible Project. This Agreement shall also govern the terms, conditions and
procedures under which Eligible Projects may be added to the Borrowing Base.

                  (i)      The Borrowers will give notice to the Administrative
Agent in writing in advance of its intention to add a particular Facility as an
Eligible Project under the Credit Facility. Each Total Development Budget for an
Eligible Project shall include an interest reserve (the "Interest Reserve"), an
Operating Reserve, a hard cost contingency reserve of not less than five percent
(5%) of the total budgeted construction costs and a development fee payable to
SDI (the "Development Fee") each in amounts acceptable to the Administrative
Agent and shall demonstrate to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction in its
sole discretion that the Eligible Project will be designated as a Pool A
Project.

         Section 2.2 Procedure for Advances.

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent will make advances from time
to time upon receipt of written request from the Borrowers in the form
designated by the Administrative Agent, provided that after giving effect to the
Borrowers' request, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan would not
exceed the lesser of the Credit Facility Committed Amount or the Borrowing Base.
Each advance under the Loan shall be in an amount of not less than $500,000, and
in increments of $100,000 in excess thereof. Advances or the renewal of a
Interest Period shall be requested by the Borrowers orally or in writing by
10:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) three (3) Banking Days prior to the Banking Day on
which the funds will be advanced. The Borrowers shall advise the Administrative
Agent at the time of such notice which Interest Period they are selecting or
whether they are selecting the Base Rate. The Administrative Agent shall have no
obligation to make any advance if at the time such advance is requested and/or
is proposed to be funded, there exists an Event of Default or an event which
upon notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an Event of Default under
the Financing Documents.

                  (b)      In addition, if the Administrative Agent has reason
to believe a Default or an Event of Default has occurred, the Borrowers hereby
irrevocably authorize the Lenders to make advances of the Loan at any time and
from time to time, without further request from or notice to the Borrowers,
which the Lenders, in their sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or
appropriate to protect the Lenders' interests under this Agreement or otherwise,
including, without limitation, advances of the Loan made to cover interest on
the Loan, fees, and/or Enforcement Costs, prior to, on, or after the termination
of this Agreement, regardless of whether the aggregate amount of the advances of
the Loan which the Lenders may make hereunder exceeds the Credit Facility
Committed Amount. The Lenders shall have no obligation whatsoever to make any
advance under this subsection and the making of one or more advances under this
subsection shall not obligate the Lenders to make other similar advances. Any
such advances will be evidenced by the Note secured by the Collateral and the
Deeds of Trust.

         Section 2.3 Fees.

         The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent the following fees:

                  (a)      Unused Line Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders beginning on the date set
forth below a quarterly facility fee (the "Unused Line Fee") in an amount equal
to twenty-five (25) basis points per annum of the average daily unused and
undisbursed portion of the Loan. The accrued and unpaid portion of the Unused
Line Fee shall be paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent as of the
Credit Facility Closing Date and on the first day of each fiscal quarter and on
the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

                  (b)      Appraisal Fees. Upon the receipt of an appraiser's
invoice from the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall pay the fee of the
appraiser for an Eligible Project or for any Facility appraised at the request
of the Borrowers whether or not a Facility Closing is completed for such
Facility.

         Section 2.4 Interest Rate Matters and Payments.

                  (a)      Lender Tax Adjustment. Each payment made by the
Borrowers under the Note shall either (i) be exempt from, and be made without
reduction by reason of, any Lender Tax or (ii) to the extent that any such
payment shall be subject to any Lender Tax, be accompanied by an additional
payment by the Borrowers of such amount as may be necessary so that the net
amount received by each Lender (after deducting all applicable Taxes) is the
same as such Lender would have received had such payment not been subject to
such Lender Tax. Upon any payment of Lender Tax by the Borrowers, the Borrowers
shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days) furnish to the Administrative
Agent and applicable Lender such tax receipts, certificates an other evidence of
such payment as the Borrowers may have or the Administrative Agent or the
applicable Lender may reasonably request.

                  (b)      Inability to Determine Eurodollar Base Rate. In the
event that the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
London interbank market, quotation of Eurodollar Base Rates for any portion of
any of the Notes are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
relevant maturities for the purpose of determining a Eurodollar Rate for any
portion of the principal sum, the Administrative Agent will give notice of such
determination to the Borrowers and each Lender at least one day prior to the
date of an advance or any subsequent Interest Period for the Loan. If any such
notice is given, no Lender shall have any obligation to make any advance or
maintain any principal sum outstanding at a Eurodollar Rate. Until the earlier
of the date any such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent or
the date when the Lenders and the Borrowers have mutually agreed upon an
alternate method of determining the rates of interest payable on the Loan, as
the case may be, the Borrowers shall not have the right to have additional
advances or maintain any portion of the Credit Facility at a Eurodollar Rate,
whereupon the Lenders and the Borrowers shall mutually agree upon an alternate
method of determining the rates of interest payable on the Loan or such Lender's
portion of the principal outstanding under the Note shall be immediately due and
payable.

                  (c)      Applicable Interest Rates.

                           (i)      Each advance under Loan shall bear interest
         at either the Base Rate or the Eurodollar Rate, as selected and
         specified by the Borrowers in an Interest Rate Election Notice
         furnished to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions
         of Section 2.4(d) (Selection of Interest Rates), or as otherwise
         determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4
         (Interest Rate Matters), and as may be adjusted from time to time in
         accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4(b) (Inability to
         Determine Eurodollar Base Rate).

                           (ii)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
         occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the
         option of the Administrative Agent, all Loans and all other Obligations
         shall bear interest at the Post-Default Rate.

                           (iii)    The Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans
         shall be two hundred twelve and one-half (212.5) basis points per
         annum.

                  (d)      Selection of Interest Rates.

                           (i)      The Borrowers may select the initial
         Applicable Interest Rate or Applicable Interest Rates to be charged on
         portions of the Loan.

                           (ii)     From time to time after the date of this
         Agreement as provided in this Section, by a proper and timely Interest
         Rate Election Notice furnished to the Administrative Agent in
         accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4(d)(v) (Selection of
         Interest Rates) , the Borrowers may select an initial Applicable
         Interest Rate or Applicable Interest Rates for any portion of the Loan
         or may convert the Applicable Interest Rate and, when applicable, the
         Interest Period, for any existing Loan to any other Applicable Interest
         Rate or, when applicable, any other Interest Period.

                           (iii)    The Borrowers' selection of an Applicable
         Interest Rate and/or an Interest Period, the Borrowers' election to
         convert an Applicable Interest Rate and/or an Interest Period to
         another Applicable Interest Rate or Interest Period, and any other
         adjustments in an interest rate are subject to the following
         limitations:

                                    (A)      the Borrowers shall not at any time
                  select or change to an Interest Period that extends beyond the
                  Credit Facility Expiration Date;

                                    (B)      except as otherwise provided in
                  Section 2.4(e) (Indemnity), no change from the Eurodollar Rate
                  to the Base Rate shall become effective on a day other than a
                  Business Day and on a day which is the last day of the then
                  current Interest Period, no change of an Interest Period shall
                  become effective on a day other than the last day of the then
                  current Interest Period, and no change


                                       25
<PAGE>   32
                  from the Base Rate to the Eurodollar Rate shall become
                  effective on a day other than a day which is a Eurodollar
                  Business Day;

                                    (C)      any Applicable Interest Rate change
                  for any Loan to be effective on a date on which any principal
                  payment on account of such Loan is scheduled to be paid shall
                  be made only after such payment shall have been made;

                                    (D)      no more than six (6) different
                  Eurodollar Rates may be outstanding at any time and from time
                  to time, provided that not more than one (1) may be a seven
                  (7) day Interest Period;

                                    (E)      the first day of each Interest
                  Period shall be a Eurodollar Business Day;

                                    (F)      as of the effective date of a
                  selection, there shall not exist an Event of Default; and

                                    (G)      the minimum principal amount of a
                  Eurodollar Loan shall be Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
                  ($500,000).

                           (iv)     If a request for an advance under the Loans
         is not accompanied by an Interest Rate Election Notice or does not
         otherwise include a selection of an Applicable Interest Rate and, if
         applicable, an Interest Period, or if, after having made a selection of
         an Applicable Interest Rate and, if applicable, an Interest Period, the
         Borrowers fail or are not otherwise entitled under the provisions of
         this Agreement to continue such Applicable Interest Rate or Interest
         Period, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have selected the Base Rate as
         the Applicable Interest Rate until such time as the Borrowers have
         selected a different Applicable Interest Rate and specified an Interest
         Period in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of this
         Section.

                           (v)      The Administrative Agent will not be
         obligated to make Loans, to convert the Applicable Interest Rate on
         Loans to another Applicable Interest Rate, or to change Interest
         Periods, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received an
         irrevocable written or telephonic notice (an "Interest Rate Election
         Notice") from the Borrowers specifying the following information:

                                    (A)      the amount to be borrowed or
                  converted;

                                    (B)      a section of the Base Rate or the
                  Eurodollar Rate;

                                    (C)      the length of the Interest Period
                  if the Applicable Interest Rate selected is the Eurodollar
                  Rate; and

                                    (D)      the requested date on which such
                  election is to be effective.




                                       26
<PAGE>   33
         Any telephonic notice must be confirmed in writing within three (3)
Business Days. Each Interest Rate Election Notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern Standard Time) on the
Business Day of any requested borrowing or conversion in the case of a selection
of the Base Rate and not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern Standard Time) on the
third Business Day before the effective date of any requested borrowing or
conversion in the case of a selection of the Eurodollar Rate.

                  (e)      Indemnity. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree
to indemnify and reimburse the Administrative Agent and to hold the
Administrative Agent harmless from any loss, cost (including administrative
costs) or expense which the Administrative Agent may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) a default by the Borrowers in payment when due of the
principal amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan, (b) the failure of the
Borrowers to make, or convert the Applicable Interest Rate of any portion of the
Loan after the Borrowers have given a request for an advance or an Interest Rate
Election Notice, (c) the failure of the Borrowers to make any prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan after the Borrowers have given notice of such intention to make
such a prepayment, and/or (d) the making by the Borrowers of a prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Loan, breakage costs calculated by the Administrative Agent,
including, without limitation, any such loss or expense arising from the
reemployment of funds obtained by the Administrative Agents to maintain any
Eurodollar Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such
funds were obtained. This agreement and covenant of the Borrowers shall survive
termination or expiration of this Agreement and payment of the other
Obligations.

                  (f)      Payment of Interest.

                           (i)      Unpaid and accrued interest on any portion
         of the Loans which consists of a Base Rate Loan shall be paid monthly,
         in arrears, on the first day of each calendar month, commencing on the
         first such date after the date of this Agreement, and on the first day
         of each calendar month thereafter, and at maturity (whether by
         acceleration, declaration, extension or otherwise).

                           (ii)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all
         unpaid and accrued interest on any Base Rate Loan converted to a
         Eurodollar Loan or prepaid shall be paid immediately upon such
         conversion and/or prepayment, as appropriate.

                  (g)      Unpaid and accrued interest on any Eurodollar Loan
shall be paid monthly and on the last Business Day of each Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Loan and at maturity (whether by acceleration, declaration,
extension or otherwise); provided, however that any and all unpaid and accrued
interest on any Eurodollar Loan prepaid prior to expiration of the then current
Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan shall be paid immediately upon
prepayment.

                  (h)      Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Financing Documents to the contrary, in the event that it shall become
unlawful for any Lender to obtain funds in the London interbank market or for
such Lender to maintain the Loan at the Eurodollar Rate, then, by written notice
to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may declare that
advances will not thereafter be made or the Loan maintained by such Lender


                                       27
<PAGE>   34
hereunder at the Eurodollar Rate, whereupon the Lenders and the Borrowers shall
mutually agree upon an alternate method of determining the rates of interest
payable on the Loan or such Lender's portion of the principal outstanding under
the Note shall be immediately due and payable.

                  (i)      Increased Costs and Reduced Return.

                           (i)      If any event shall occur (whether in the
         form of a reserve requirement (not included in the definition of the
         Eurodollar Rate), exchange control regulations, governmental charges,
         compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
         Governmental Authority, changes in the London interbank market or the
         position of any Lender in such market or otherwise) and the result of
         any such event is, in such Lender's reasonable judgment, to increase
         the costs which such Lender determines are attributable to its making
         or maintaining the Loan at the Eurodollar Rate in excess of those costs
         already in effect as of June 1, 2001, or its obligation to make
         available the Loan at the Eurodollar Rate or to reduce the amount of
         any sum received or receivable by such Lender under the Note, then,
         within ten (10) days after demand by such Lender, Borrowers hereby
         agree to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
         compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

                           (ii)     In addition to any amounts payable pursuant
         to Section (i), if any Lender shall have determined that the
         applicability of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted
         pursuant to or arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle
         Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled
         "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
         Standards," or the adoption after the date hereof of any other law,
         rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change
         in any of the foregoing or in the enforcement or interpretation or
         administration of any of the foregoing by any court or any central bank
         or other Governmental Authority, charged with the enforcement or
         interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender
         (or any lending office of such Lender) or such Lender's holding company
         with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
         not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
         comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
         return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's
         holding company, if any, as a consequence of its making or maintaining
         the Loan or its incurring any obligations under this Agreement to a
         level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company
         could have achieved but for such applicability, adoption, change or
         compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the
         policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital
         adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon
         demand by such Lender, the Borrowers hereby agree to pay to such Lender
         from time to time such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
         such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction
         suffered.



                                       28
<PAGE>   35
                  (j)      Notice of Amounts Payable to Lenders. If any Lender
shall seek payment of any amounts from Borrowers pursuant to this Section or
under Section 2.4 (Interest Rate Matters), it shall notify the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent of the amount payable by the Borrowers to such Lender
hereunder. A certificate of such Lender seeking payment setting forth in
reasonable detail the factual basis for and the computation of the amount
specified, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties for all purposes,
absent manifest error, as to the amounts owned. The Borrowers' obligations under
this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment
of the Obligations.

         Section 2.5 Computation of Interest and Fees

         All applicable fees and interest shall be calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 days for the actual number of days elapsed pursuant to the terms of
the Note and interest shall be payable monthly in arrears.

         Section 2.6 Permitted Costs.

         Advances under the Borrowing Base shall be made available by the
Lenders pursuant to a Borrowing Base Report issued quarterly by the
Administrative Agent or more frequently in the Administrative Agent's discretion
and certified by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
That portion of the Borrowing Base composed of Costs Incurred to Date shall be
related to expenditures for each Eligible Facility described in the applicable
Total Development Budget. Each Total Development Budget may include the cost of
(i) the acquisition by the Borrowers of the Land which is the site of such
Facility, (ii) the construction on the Premises of a Facility containing
residential units and common facilities (iii) marketing, staffing and similar
pre-opening expenses and (iv) an Operating Reserve. Unless otherwise agreed to
by the Administrative Agent and to the extent specifically permitted by the
Administrative Agent, the process of verification of Requisitions shall confirm
the payment by any of the Borrowers of the following costs and expenses related
to the development of the Premises and the construction of the Improvements and

                                       29
<PAGE>   36
by or on behalf of the Borrowers shall be in the form approved by the
Administrative Agent (each a "Requisition" collectively, the "Requisitions")
signed by James S. Pope, Larry Hulse, Christian B. A. Slavin or Jay Beckhorn on
behalf of the Borrowers and approved by the Architect, showing the percentage of
completion and setting forth in trade breakdown form and in such detail as may
be required by the Administrative Agent the amounts expended and/or costs
incurred for work done and necessary materials incorporated in the Improvements.
The Requisition shall also show the percentage of completion of each line item
on the applicable Borrower's cost breakdown approved by the Administrative
Agent. The Borrowers shall submit with each Requisition a statement that the
work completed to the date of such Requisition is of quality consistent with the
applicable Plans and Specifications. In addition, at the time of delivery of
each Requisition by the Borrowers, the Borrowers shall furnish to the
Administrative Agent such additional information (such as paid receipts,
invoices, statements of accounts, etc.) as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably require to assure that amounts shown in the Requisition have been
paid by or on behalf of the Borrowers. Requisitions verified by the Real Estate
Loan Administration Group during the course of a fiscal quarter will be included
in the calculation of the next Borrowing Base Report.

         Section 2.8 Co-Borrower Obligations.

         Each Person included in the term "Borrowers", including each Additional
Borrower, hereby covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Lenders as follows:

                  (a)      The Facility Owner Obligations include all present
and future indebtedness, duties, obligations, and liabilities, whether now
existing or contemplated or hereafter arising, of any one or more of the
Additional Borrowers or the Original Borrowers owned by the same Qualified
Intermediary in connection with the Loan.

                  (b)      Reference in this Agreement and the other Financing
Documents to the "Borrowers" or otherwise with respect to any one or more of the
Persons now or hereafter included in the definition of "Borrowers" shall mean
each and every such Person and any one or more of such Persons unless the
context requires otherwise.

                  (c)      Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to make advances to any one or
more or to all of such Persons, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
upon the written, oral or telephonic request any one or more of the Persons who
is from time to time a Responsible Officer of a Borrower under the provisions of
the most recent certificate of corporate resolutions and/or incumbency of the
Person included in the term "Borrowers" on file with the Administrative Agent
and also upon the written, oral or telephone request of any one of the
Responsible Officers.

                  (d)      The Administrative Agent assumes no responsibility or
liability for any errors, mistakes, and/or discrepancies in the oral,
telephonic, written or other transmissions of any instructions, orders, requests
and confirmations between the Administrative Agent and any one or more of the
Persons included in the term "Borrowers", any advance under the Loan or any
other transaction in connection with the provisions of this Agreement except
those resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

         Section 2.9 Agreement Among Borrowers.

         Without implying any limitation on the joint and several nature of the
Obligations, the Administrative Agent agrees that, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Persons included in the term "Borrowers" may
create reasonable inter-company indebtedness between or among the Persons
included in the term "Borrowers" with respect to the allocation of the benefits
and proceeds of the advances under this Agreement. The Persons included in the
term "Borrowers" agree among themselves, and the Administrative Agent consents
to that agreement, that each such Person shall have rights of contribution from
all of the such Persons to the extent such Person incurs Obligations in excess
of the proceeds of the Loan received by, or allocated to purposes for the direct
benefit of, such Person. All such indebtedness and rights shall be, and are
hereby agreed by the Persons included in the term "Borrowers" to be, subordinate
in priority and payment to the indefeasible repayment in full in cash of the
Obligations, and, unless the Administrative Agent agrees in writing otherwise,
shall not be exercised or repaid in whole or in part until all of the
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Each Person included in
the term "Borrowers" agrees that all of such inter-company indebtedness and
rights of contribution are part of the Collateral and secure the Obligations.
Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby waives all rights of
counterclaim, recoupment and offset between or among themselves arising on
account of that indebtedness and otherwise. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Administrative Agent, no Person included in the term "Borrowers"
shall evidence the inter-company indebtedness or rights of contribution by note
or other instrument, and shall not secure such indebtedness or rights of
contribution with any Lien or security.

         Section 2.10 Benefits to Borrowers.

         Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby represents and
warrants to the Administrative Agent that each of them will derive benefits,
directly and indirectly, from each advance under the Loan, both in their
separate capacity and as a member of the integrated group to which each such
Person belongs and because the successful operation of the integrated group is
dependent upon the continued successful performance of the functions of the
integrated group as a whole, because (i) the terms of the consolidated financing
provided under this Agreement are more favorable than would otherwise be
obtainable by such Persons individually, and (ii) the additional administrative
and other costs and reduced flexibility associated with individual financing
arrangements which would otherwise be required if obtainable would substantially
reduce the value to such Persons of the financing.

         Section 2.11 Guaranty.

                  (a)      Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the Administrative Agent:

                           (i)      the due and punctual payment in full (and
         not merely the collectibility) by the other Persons included in the
         term "Borrowers" of their applicable Facility Owner Obligations,
         including unpaid and accrued interest thereon, in each case when due
         and payable, all according to the terms of this Agreement, the Note and
         the other Financing Documents;



                                       31
<PAGE>   38
                           (ii)     the due and punctual payment in full (and
         not merely the collectibility) by the other Persons included in the
         term "Borrowers" which are owned by the same Qualified Intermediary of
         all other sums and charges which may at any time be due and payable in
         accordance with this Agreement, the Note or any of the other Financing
         Documents;

                           (iii)    the due and punctual performance by the
         other Persons included in the term "Borrowers" which are owned by the
         same Qualified Intermediary of all of the other terms, covenants and
         conditions contained in the Financing Documents; and

                           (iv)     all the other Facility Owner Obligations of
         the other Persons included in the term "Borrowers" which are owned by
         the same Qualified Intermediary.

                  (b)      The obligations and liabilities of each Person
included in the term "Borrowers" as a guarantor under this Section shall be
absolute and unconditional and joint and several as to the Facility Owner
Obligations, irrespective of the genuineness, validity, priority, regularity or
enforceability of this Agreement, the Note or any of the Financing Documents or
any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of a surety or guarantor. Each Person included in the term "Borrowers"
in its capacity as a guarantor expressly agrees that the Administrative Agent
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, without notice to or further assent of
such Borrower and without in any way releasing, affecting or in any way
impairing the joint and several obligations and liabilities of such Person as a
guarantor hereunder (limited as described herein):

                           (i)      waive compliance with, or any defaults
         under, or grant any other indulgences under or with respect to any of
         the Financing Documents;

                           (ii)     modify, amend, change or terminate any
         provisions of any of the Financing Documents;

                           (iii)    grant extensions or renewals of or with
         respect to this Agreement, the Note or any of the other Financing
         Documents;

                           (iv)     effect any release, subordination,
         compromise or settlement in connection with this Agreement, the Note or
         any of the other Financing Documents;

                           (v)      agree to the substitution, exchange, release
         or other disposition of the Collateral or any part thereof, or any
         other collateral for the Loan or to the subordination of any lien or
         security interest therein;

                           (vi)     make advances for the purpose of performing
         any term, provision or covenant contained in this Agreement, the Note
         or any of the other Financing Documents with respect to which the
         Borrower shall then be in default;



                                       32
<PAGE>   39
                           (vii)    make future advances pursuant to this
         Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents;

                           (viii)   assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise
         transfer, the Obligations, the Note, any of the other Financing
         Documents or any interest therein, all as and to the extent permitted
         by the provisions of this Agreement;

                           (ix)     deal in all respects with the other Persons
         included in the term "Borrowers" as if this Section were not in effect;

                           (x)      effect any release, compromise or settlement
         with any of the other Persons included in the term "Borrowers", whether
         in their capacity as a Borrower or as a guarantor under this Section or
         any other guarantor; and

                           (xi)     provide debtor-in-possession financing or
         allow use of cash collateral in proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code,
         it being expressly agreed by all Persons included in the term
         "Borrowers" that any such financing and/or use would be part of the
         Obligations.

                  (c)      The obligations and liabilities of each Person
included in the term "Borrowers", as guarantor of the Facility Owner Obligations
under this Section shall be primary, direct and immediate, shall not be subject
to any counterclaim, recoupment, set off, reduction or defense based upon any
claim that such Person may have against any one or more of the other Persons
included in the term "Borrowers", the Administrative Agent and/or any other
guarantor and shall not be conditional or contingent upon pursuit or enforcement
by the Administrative Agent of any remedies it may have against Persons included
in the term "Borrowers" with respect to this Agreement, the Note or any of the
other Financing Documents, whether pursuant to the terms thereof or by operation
of law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative
Agent shall not be required to make any demand upon any of the Persons included
in the term "Borrowers", or to sell the Collateral or otherwise pursue, enforce
or exhaust its or their remedies against the Persons included in the term
"Borrowers" or the Collateral either before, concurrently with or after pursuing
or enforcing its rights and remedies hereunder. Any one or more successive or
concurrent actions or proceedings may be brought against each Person included in
the term "Borrowers" under this Section, either in the same action, if any,
brought against any one or more of the Persons included in the term "Borrowers"
or in separate actions or proceedings, as often as the Administrative Agent may
deem expedient or advisable. Without limiting the foregoing, it is specifically
understood that any modification, limitation or discharge of any of the
liabilities or obligations of any one or more of the Persons included in the
term "Borrowers", any other guarantor or any obligor under any of the Financing
Documents, arising out of, or by virtue of, any bankruptcy, arrangement,
reorganization or similar proceeding for relief of debtors under federal or
state law initiated by or against any one or more of the Persons included in the
term "Borrowers", in their respective capacities as borrowers and guarantors
under this Section, or under any of the Financing Documents shall not modify,
limit, lessen, reduce, impair, discharge, or otherwise affect the liability of
each Borrower under this Section in any manner whatsoever, and this Section
shall remain and continue in full force and effect. It is the intent and purpose
of this Section that each Person included in the term "Borrowers" shall and does
hereby waive all rights and benefits which might accrue to any other


                                       33
<PAGE>   40
guarantor by reason of any such proceeding, and the Persons included in the term
"Borrowers" agree that they shall be liable for the full amount of the
obligations and liabilities under this Section regardless of, and irrespective
to, any modification, limitation or discharge of the liability of any one or
more of the Persons included in the term "Borrowers", any other guarantor or any
obligor under any of the Financing Documents, that may result from any such
proceedings.

                  (d)      Each Person included in the term "Borrowers", as
guarantor under this Section, hereby unconditionally, jointly and severally,
irrevocably and expressly waives:

                           (i)      presentment and demand for payment of the
         Obligations and protest of non-payment;

                           (ii)     notice of acceptance of this Section and of
         presentment, demand and protest thereof;

                           (iii)    notice of any default hereunder or under the
         Note or any of the other Financing Documents and notice of all
         indulgences;

                           (iv)     notice of any increase in the amount of any
         portion of or all of the indebtedness guaranteed by this Section;

                           (v)      demand for observance, performance or
         enforcement of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, the
         Note or any of the other Financing Documents;

                           (vi)     all errors and omissions in connection with
         the Administrative Agent's administration of all indebtedness
         guaranteed by this Section;

                           (vii)    any right or claim of right to cause a
         marshalling of the assets of any one or more of the other Persons
         included in the term "Borrowers";

                           (viii)   any act or omission of the Administrative
         Agent which changes the scope of the risk as guarantor hereunder; and

                           (ix)     All other notices and demands otherwise
         required by law which such Person may lawfully waive.

                  (e)      Within ten (10) days following any request of the
Administrative Agent to do so, each Person included in the term "Borrowers" will
furnish the Administrative Agent and such other persons as the Administrative
Agent may direct with a written certificate, duly acknowledged stating in detail
whether or not any credits, offsets or defenses exist with respect to this
Section.

                  (a)      First, to all Enforcement Costs and other expenses of
the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders;

                  (b)      Second, to all amounts due to the Administrative
Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) from the Borrowers or the
Lenders;

                  (c)      Third, to the Lenders, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share, for the past due interest on the Notes;

                  (d)      Fourth, to the payment of any prepayment penalty or

                  (e)      Fifth, to the Lenders, in accordance with their

                  (f)      Sixth, to the Lenders, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, for past due fees required under the Financing
Documents;

                  (g)      Seventh, to the Administrative Agent, in payment or
reimbursement of any over-drafts in any account of the Borrowers; and

                  (h)      Eighth, to the Lenders, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, for all other amounts owed the Lenders pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement or the other Financing Documents.


                                   ARTICLE III
                                   COLLATERAL

         Section 3.1 Collateral.

         As security for the payment of any and all of the Obligations and for
the Borrowers' performance of, and compliance with, all of the terms, covenants,
conditions, stipulations and agreements contained in the Financing Documents,
the Borrowers hereby assign, grant and convey to the Lenders, and agree that the
Lenders shall have, to the extent permitted by law a perfected, continuing
security interest in, all of the Collateral. The Borrowers further agree that
the Lenders shall have in respect of the Collateral all of the rights and
remedies of a secured party under the Virginia Uniform Commercial Code and the
Uniform Commercial Code of those other states in which the Facilities are
located, whichever is applicable, and under other applicable Laws as well as
those provided in this Agreement. The Borrowers covenant and agree to execute
and deliver such financing statements and other instruments and filings as are
necessary in the opinion of the Administrative Agent to perfect such security
interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the proceeds of the Collateral
constitute a part of the Collateral, the Borrowers may not dispose of the
Collateral, or any part thereof, other than in the ordinary


                                       35
<PAGE>   42
course of their business or as otherwise may be permitted by this Agreement or
other Security Agreements. The foregoing notwithstanding only that Collateral
provided by a Borrower shall only serve as Collateral for the portion of the
Obligations evidenced by such Borrower's Facility Owner Note and the Facility
Owner Notes issued by another Borrower which is owned by the same Qualified
Intermediary as such Borrower.

         Section 3.2 Eligible Projects.

         The Borrowers shall from time to time designate Facilities owned by any
of the Borrowers as Eligible Projects included in the Borrowing Base pursuant to
the terms hereof. The Facilities which are currently Eligible Projects are
listed on EXHIBIT C attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference or any
future Borrowing Base Report. The Credit Facility shall be secured by (a) the
first lien Deeds of Trust on the fee simple interests of the Borrowers in the
Eligible Projects or on the leasehold interests of Borrowers under Qualified
Ground Leases, (b) a first lien security interest in all fixtures, building
materials and all other machinery, equipment and other personalty used or
installed by the Borrowers or each of the premises of an Eligible Project or in
the Improvements constructed thereon, and (c) all of the other Collateral
relating to the Eligible Projects. The Administrative Agent may in its sole
discretion agree to include a Facility occupied pursuant to a Qualified Ground
Lease; provided, however, that at no time shall the aggregate Deed of Trust Lien
Amounts of Eligible Projects under the Master Credit Facility subject to
Qualified Ground Leases, plus the Aggregate Deed of Trust Lien Amounts of
Eligible Projects under this Credit Facility subject to Qualified Ground Leases
which are not Sunrise Qualified Ground Leases comprise more than twenty percent
(20%) of the Credit Facility Committed Amount under the Master Credit Facility
at any one time.

         Section 3.3 Assignment of Ownership Interests.

         The Obligations are further secured by one or more Pledge, Assignment
and Security Agreements, pursuant to which the owners of each of the Borrowers
have assigned to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders one
hundred percent (100%) of all partnership or member interests in each of the
Borrowers.

         Section 3.4 Guaranties.

         The Obligations are the subject of the Master Guaranty, the Guaranties
and the Performance Guaranties executed and delivered by the applicable
Guarantors in favor of the Lenders.

         Section 3.5 Collateral for Obligations.

         The Borrowers acknowledge that it is the intention of the Borrowers
that the Collateral and all the Deeds of Trust be security for all of the
Obligations, both those now existing and those hereafter created or incurred by
future loan, advances, extensions of credit or otherwise and whether or not
currently contemplated by the Borrowers and/or the Lenders on or about the date
hereof.

         Section 3.6 Costs.

         The Borrowers agree to pay on demand, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable laws, all reasonable fees, commissions, costs, charges, travel
expenses and other expenses incurred by the Lenders, or any of them, in
connection with the taking, perfection, preservation, protection and/or release
of any security interest or lien on any of the Collateral or Deeds of Trust. The
foregoing notwithstanding, the Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay the
travel expenses of the Lenders with the exception of travel expenses incurred in
connection with any enforcement actions following the occurrence of an Event of
Default. If the Borrowers elect not to finance a Facility under this Credit
Facility but the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lenders have incurred
costs in connection with reviewing such Facility for inclusion in the Borrowing
Base, including but not limited to appraisal fees, environmental review fees or
legal fees, all of such fees and expenses will be paid by the Borrowers upon
demand by the Administrative Agent.


                                   ARTICLE IV
                          GENERAL FINANCING PROVISIONS

         company). In connection with the addition of an Additional Borrower,
         the Administrative Agent shall have received and approved copies of all
         organizational documents, including certified copies of all documents
         on record with the State in which such entity is organized.

                           (iii)    The Administrative Agent shall have received
         and approved a certificate executed by all of the general and limited
         partners or members of the Borrowers authorizing the execution and

security interest for all the applicable Facility Owner Obligations upon any and
all monies, securities, and other property of the Borrowers and the proceeds
thereof, now or hereafter held or received by or in transit to, the Lenders, or
any affiliate of any of the Lenders, from or for any of the Borrowers, and also
upon any and all deposits (general or special) and credits of any of the
Borrowers with any of the Lenders, if any, at any time existing. During the
continuance of any Event of Default under this Agreement, each Lender is hereby
authorized by any of the Borrowers at any time and from time to time, without
notice to the Borrowers, to set off, appropriate and apply any or all items
hereinabove referred to against all then outstanding Obligations. The Lenders
agree that the Notes shall be cross-collateralized only among those Borrowers
owned by the same Qualified Intermediary and not among Borrowers owned by
different Qualified Intermediaries.

         Section 4.5 Payment and Performance of Obligations.

         The payment and performance by the Borrowers of the Obligations arising
with respect to Borrowers owned by the same Qualified Intermediary shall be
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any defense or any rights of
set-off, recoupment or counterclaim it might otherwise have against the Lenders,
or any of them, and the Borrowers shall pay absolutely net all of the
Obligations arising with respect to Borrowers owned by the same Qualified
Intermediary, free of any deductions and without abatement, diminution or
set-off; and until payment in full of all of the Obligations, the Borrowers: (a)

the Administrative Agent, and (c) will not terminate or attempt to terminate
this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents to which any of the
Borrowers is a party for any cause.

         Section 4.6 Payments to Others for the Account of the Borrowers.

         At the option of the Lenders and without any request from the
Borrowers, and without waiving any of its rights hereunder, the Lenders may
elect to cure or avoid any default by the Borrowers under the Financing
Documents by applying amounts due hereunder or advancing the Lenders' own funds
to the satisfaction of the conditions of the Financing Documents and any amounts
so applied shall be part of the Loan and shall be secured by the Deeds of Trust
and the other Collateral of the applicable group of Borrowers owned by the same
Qualified Intermediary. The Administrative Agent agrees to endeavor to give the
Borrowers notice of any such payment or performing such act and the amount of
any payment whether prior to or contemporaneously with its making such payment
or performance of such act; provided, however, that failure to give such notice
shall not constitute a waiver by the Lenders of, or constitute a defense to, any
of the rights of the Lenders under this Agreement or the other Financing
Documents, including (without limitation) the right of the Lenders to repayment
of the amount of such payment.

         Section 4.7 Prepayment.

         The Borrowers shall have the right to prepay the Loan in full or in
part, at any time and from time to time, upon five (5) days' prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent without premium or penalty. The foregoing
notwithstanding, in connection with any prepayment of a principal sum on any day
other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrowers
shall pay to the Administrative Agent upon request by the Administrative Agent,
such amount as shall be sufficient to compensate any of the Lenders for any and
all losses or expenses which such Lender may sustain or incur (including without
limitation, any such loss or expense arising from the redeployment of funds
obtained by such Lender). Unless an Event of Default has occurred, any partial
prepayment shall be applied first to such breakage costs, second to accrued and
unpaid interest and third to the outstanding principal balance of the Loan due
and owing at maturity. Sums borrowed and repaid may not be readvanced. The
Borrowers' obligations under this Section shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations.

         Section 4.8 Assignments.

         The Borrowers agree not to transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate any
right or interest in any payment or advance due pursuant to this Agreement, or
any of the other benefits of this Agreement, without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent. Any assignment made or attempted by the Borrowers,
or any of them, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent
shall be void and of no effect. No consent by the Administrative Agent to an
assignment by the Borrowers shall release the Borrowers as the parties primarily
obligated and liable under the terms of this Agreement unless the Borrowers
shall be released specifically by the Administrative Agent in writing. No
consent by the Administrative Agent to an assignment shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the requirement of prior written consent by the Administrative Agent
with respect to each and every further assignment and as a condition precedent
to the effectiveness of such assignment.

operating License has been issued for the Facility by the appropriate
Governmental Authority or Authorities. Advances from the Operating Reserve shall

Borrowers agree that such study is for informational purposes only and that the
Administrative Agent is not warranting the accuracy, completeness or reliability

not require that a feasibility study be obtained on any Facility. Administrative

whether to proceed to have an Appraisal performed for a proposed Facility.
However, the Administrative Agent shall receive a copy of any such feasibility
study and the Borrowers shall pay the cost of each such study on demand by the
Administrative Agent, whether or not such Facility becomes an Eligible Project.
The Borrowers acknowledge that any Appraisal of the same Facility may or may not
be performed by the same party who performed any market feasibility study, in
the Administrative Agent's sole discretion.

AGREEMENT SHALL IN NO WAY AFFECT OR CONDITION THE RIGHT OF THE LENDERS TO DEMAND

which are hereby expressly waived, anything contained herein or in any of the

all rights and privileges of the Borrowers under such contracts and agreements
for the purpose of realizing on the Collateral and to the extent and for the
time required to realize the value of the Collateral;

                  (b) to the extent permitted by applicable law, assume such
management, operation and control of the Property to the extent and for the time
necessary to realize the value of the Collateral;

                  (c) cause the Borrowers to engage, contract with, and/or hire

Administrative Agent to the Borrowers and, in addition to any rights or remedies
available to them under the Deed of Trust or any of the other Financing
Documents, to enter into possession of any of the Property and perform any and
all work and labor necessary to complete the development of such Land and the
construction of the Improvements thereon (whether or not in accordance with the
Plans and Specifications therefor) and to employ watchmen to protect the
Property and the Improvements. All sums expended by the Lenders for such
purposes shall be deemed to have been advanced to the Borrowers under the Note

the Borrowers hereby constitute and appoint the Lenders, or the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Lenders, its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
power of substitution to complete work on any Eligible Project in the name of
the Borrowers, and hereby empowers said attorney or attorneys as follows:

                  (a) To use any funds of any of the Borrowers including any
balance which may be held in escrow and any funds which may remain unadvanced
under any of the Facility Owner Notes for the purpose of completing the
development of any of the Land and the construction of any of the Improvements,
except that a Borrower's funds may only be used for development and construction
of a Facility owned by itself or another Borrower owned by the same Qualified
Intermediary whether or not in the manner called for in the Plans and
Specifications;

                  (b) To make such additions and changes and corrections to any
of the Plans and Specifications which shall be necessary or desirable in the
judgment of the Administrative Agent to complete the development of any of the
Land and the construction of any of the Improvements;

                  (c) To employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents,
architects and inspectors as shall be necessary or desirable for said purpose;

                  (d) To pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims
which are or may be liens against any of the Property, or may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the work or the clearance of title to any of the
Property;

                  (e) To execute all applications and certificates which may be
required in the name of any of the Borrowers; and

                  (f) To do any and every act with respect to the development of
the Land and the construction of the Improvements which any of the Borrowers may
do in its own behalf.

         It is understood and agreed that this power of attorney shall be deemed
to be a power coupled with an interest which cannot be revoked. Said
attorney-in-fact shall also have the power to prosecute and defend all actions
or proceedings in connection with the development of the Land and the
construction of the Improvements and to take such actions and to require such
performance as the Lenders may deem necessary.

         Section 10.6 Uniform Commercial Code and Other Remedies.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (and in addition to all of
its rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement), the Lenders shall have
all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the applicable Uniform
Commercial Code and other applicable laws, and the Lenders are authorized to
offset and apply to all or any part of the Obligations all moneys, credits and
other property of any nature whatsoever of the Borrowers now or at any time
hereafter in the possession of, in transit to or from, under the control or
custody of, or on deposit with, any of the Lenders; and upon demand by the
Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall assemble the Collateral and make it
available to the Lenders, at a place designated by the Administrative Agent; and
the Lenders or their agents may enter upon the Borrowers' premises to take
possession of the Collateral, to remove it, to render it unusable, or to sell or
otherwise dispose of it.

         Any written notice of the sale, disposition or other intended action by
the Lenders with respect to the Collateral which is sent by regular mail,
postage prepaid, to the Borrowers at the address set forth in ARTICLE IX (EVENTS
OF DEFAULT), or such other address of the Borrowers which may from time to time
be shown on the Lenders' records, at least ten (10) days prior to such sale,
disposition or other action, shall constitute reasonable notice to the
Borrowers. The Borrowers shall pay on demand all costs and expenses, including,
without limitation, attorney's fees and expenses, incurred by or on behalf of
the Lenders, or any of them, in preparing for sale or other disposition,
selling, managing, collecting or otherwise disposing of, the Collateral. All of
such costs and expenses (the "Liquidation Costs") together with interest thereon
from the date incurred until paid in full at the Post-Default Rate, shall be
paid by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent on demand and shall constitute
and become a part of the Obligations. Any proceeds of sale or other disposition
of the Collateral will be applied by the Lenders to the payment of the
Liquidation Costs and Expense Payments, and any balance of such proceeds will be
applied by the Lenders to the payment of the balance of the Obligations in such
order and manner of application as the Lenders may from time to time in its sole
discretion determine. After such application of the proceeds, any balance shall
be paid to the applicable Borrowers or to any other party entitled thereto.

         Section 10.7 Receiver or Other Court Order.

         Following an Event of Default, as a matter of right, following ten (10)
days notice and without regard to the adequacy of the security, and upon
application to a court of competent jurisdiction, the Lenders shall be entitled
to the immediate appointment of a receiver for all or any part of the
Collateral, and of the payments and proceeds thereof and therefrom, whether such
receivership be incidental to a proposed sale of the Collateral or otherwise,
and the Borrowers hereby consent to the appointment of such a receiver and to an
order of court directing that payments, including Medicare and Medicaid
payments, be made directly to the receiver. The Borrowers will pay to the
Beneficiary, upon demand, all expenses, including receiver's fees, attorney's
fees, costs and agents compensation, advanced by the Borrowers and incurred
pursuant to the provisions contained in this Section.

<PAGE>   89
         Section 10.8 No Conditions Precedent to Exercise of Remedies.

         The Borrowers shall not be relieved of any obligation by reason of the
failure of the Lenders to comply with any request of the Borrowers or of any
other person to take action to foreclose on the Property under the Deed of Trust
or otherwise to enforce any provision of the Financing Documents, or by reason
of the release, regardless of consideration, of all or any part of the Property,
or by reason of any agreement or stipulation between any subsequent owner of the
Property and the Lenders extending the time of payment or modifying the terms of
the Financing Documents without first having obtained the consent of the
Borrowers; and in the latter event, the Borrowers shall continue to be liable to
make payments according to the terms of any such extension or modification
agreement, unless expressly released and discharged in writing by the Lenders.

         Section 10.9 Remedies Cumulative and Concurrent.

         No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent is intended to be exclusive of any other remedies provided
for in the Financing Documents, and each and every such remedy shall be
cumulative, and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder, or
under the Financing Documents, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity
or by statute. Every right, power and remedy given by the Financing Documents to
the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be concurrent and may be pursued
separately, successively or together against any or all of the Borrowers or the
Property or any part thereof, and every right, power and remedy given by the
Financing Documents may be exercised from time to time as often as may be deemed
expedient by the Lenders or the Administrative Agent.

         Section 10.10 Strict Performance.

         No delay or omission of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to
exercise any right, power or remedy accruing upon the happening of an Event of
Default shall impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be
a waiver of any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein. No delay or
omission on the part of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to exercise any
option for acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations, or any of them, or
for foreclosure of the Deeds of Trust, or any of them, following any Event of
Default as aforesaid, or any other option granted to the Lenders hereunder in
any one or more instances, or the acceptance by the Lenders of any partial
payment on account of the Obligations shall constitute a waiver of any such
Event of Default and each such option shall remain continuously in full force
and effect.

         Section 10.11 Limited Cross-Collateralization.

         Section 11.2 Consents and Approvals.

         If any consent, approval, or authorization of any Governmental
Authority or of any Person having any interest therein, should be necessary to
effectuate any sale or other disposition of the Collateral, the Borrowers agree
to execute all such applications and other instruments, and to take all other
action, as may be required in connection with securing any such consent,
approval or authorization.

         Section 11.3 Remedies, etc. Cumulative.

         Each right, power and remedy of the Lenders as provided for in this
Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power or remedy
provided for in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity, by statute or otherwise, and the
exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Lenders of any one or more of such
rights, powers or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise
by the Lenders of any or all such other rights, powers or remedies. In order to
entitle the Lenders to exercise any remedy reserved to it herein, it shall not
be necessary to give any notice, other than such notice as may be expressly
required in this Agreement.

         Section 11.4 No Waiver of Rights by the Lenders.

         No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to
insist upon the strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement
of this Agreement or of any of the other Financing Documents, or to exercise any
right, power or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, shall constitute a
waiver of any such term, condition, covenant or agreement or of any such breach
or preclude the Administrative Agent or the Lenders from exercising any such
right, power or remedy at any later time or times. By accepting payment after
the due date of any amount payable under this Agreement or under any of the
other Financing Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Lenders
shall be deemed to waive the right either to require prompt payment when due of
all other amounts payable under this Agreement or under any of the other
Financing Documents, or to declare a default for failure to effect such prompt
payment of any such other amount.

         Section 11.5 Entire Agreement.

         The Financing Documents shall completely and fully supersede all other
agreements, both written and oral, between the Lenders and any of the Borrowers
relating to the Obligations. Neither the Lenders nor the Borrowers shall
hereafter have any rights under such prior agreements but shall look solely to
the Financing Documents for definition and determination of all of their
respective rights, liabilities and responsibilities relating to the Obligations.

         Section 11.6 Survival of Agreement; Successors and Assigns.

         All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the

other instruments or documents delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the
making by the Lenders of the Loan and the execution


                                       85
<PAGE>   92
and delivery of the Note, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as
any of the Obligations are outstanding and unpaid. Whenever in this Agreement
any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to
include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises
and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrowers which are contained in this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of
each of the Lenders, and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf
of the Lenders which are contained in this Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of the permitted successors and permitted assigns of the Borrowers, but this
Agreement may not be assigned by the Borrowers without the prior written consent
of the Lenders.

         Section 11.7 Expenses.

         The Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the

recording), the administration of the Credit Facility (not otherwise
contemplated by any fee paid by the Borrowers), any future modification of the
Financing Documents, the addition of Eligible Projects to the Borrowing Base or

any liability resulting from the failure to pay any required recordation tax,
transfer taxes, recording costs or any other expenses incurred by the Lenders in
connection with the Obligations. The provisions of this Section shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the repayment of the
Obligations. The Borrowers further agree to reimburse the Lenders upon demand
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and legal expenses and travel expenses) incurred by the Lenders, or any of them,
in enforcing any of the Obligations or any security therefor or incurred in
connection with any bankruptcy proceeding or in any post-judgment enforcement or
collection action, together with interest at the Post-Default Rate which
agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment of
the Obligations.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts all of
which together shall constitute a single instrument.

         No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or of any
of the other Financing Documents, nor consent to any departure by the Borrowers
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing

effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No
notice to or demand on the Borrowers in any case shall entitle the Borrowers to
any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other
circumstance.

         Section 11.11 Illegality.

         If fulfillment of any provision hereof or any transaction related
hereto or to any of the other Financing Documents, at the time performance of
such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity
prescribed by law, then ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be
reduced to the limit of such validity; and if any clause or provisions herein
contained other than the provisions hereof pertaining to repayment of the
Obligations operates or would prospectively operate to invalidate this Agreement
in whole or in part, then such clause or provision only shall be void, as though
not herein contained, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain operative
and in full force and effect; and if such provision pertains to repayment of the
Obligations, then, at the options of the Lenders, all of the Obligations of the

defined in the Financing Agreement) which shall be payable as provided in the
Financing Agreement; or

            (b) The occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default (as those
terms are defined in the Financing Agreement) under the terms and conditions of
any of the other Financing Documents, which Default or Event of Default remains
uncured beyond any applicable grace and/or cure period provided therefor.

      10.   Remedies.

      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, at the option of the
Administrative Agent, all amounts payable by the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders under the terms hereof shall
immediately become due and payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
without notice to the Borrower or any other person, and the Administrative Agent
shall have all of the rights, powers, and remedies available under the terms of
this Note, any of the other Financing Documents and all applicable laws. The
Borrower and all endorsers, guarantors, and other parties who may now or in the
future be primarily or secondarily liable for the payment of the indebtedness
evidenced by this Note hereby severally waive presentment, protest and demand,
notice of protest, notice of demand and of dishonor and non-payment of this Note
and expressly agree that this Note or any payment hereunder may be extended from
time to time without in any way affecting the liability of the Borrower,
guarantors and endorsers. The Borrower and all endorsers, guarantors, and other
parties who may now or in the future be liable for payment of the Obligations
hereby acknowledge that all advances to the Borrower pursuant to the Financing
Agreement will be made under and will be evidenced by this Note.

      11.   Mandatory Arbitration.

      Any controversy or claim between or among the parties hereto including but
not limited to those arising out of or relating to this Note or any related
agreements or instruments, including any claim based on or arising from an
alleged tort, shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the
Federal Arbitration Act (or if not applicable, the applicable state law), as
promulgated from time to time by the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the
Arbitration of Commercial Disputes of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services, Inc., predecessor in interest to Endispute, Inc., doing business as
"J.A.M.S./Endispute" and the "Special Rules" set forth below. In the event of
any inconsistency, the Special Rules shall control. Judgment upon any


                                       96
<PAGE>   103
arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any party to
this Note may bring an action, including a summary or expedited proceeding, to
compel arbitration of any controversy or claim to which this agreement applies
in any court having jurisdiction over such action. The foregoing
notwithstanding, in a claim pertaining to a Deed of Trust or Collateral located
in a state with "one-action" rule which might limit lenders' remedies, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right in its sole discretion to restrict the
application of this arbitration provision to the extent that it would otherwise
result in a limitation on the Administrative Agent's remedies in such state.

            (a) Special Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in Fairfax
County, Virginia and administered by J.A.M.S./Endispute who will appoint an
arbitrator pursuant to its rules of practice and procedure; if
J.A.M.S./Endispute is unable or legally precluded from administering the
arbitration, then the American Arbitration Association will serve. All
arbitration hearings will be commenced within ninety (90) calendar days of the
demand for arbitration; further, the arbitrator shall only, upon a showing of
cause, be permitted to extend the commencement of such hearing for up to an
additional sixty (60) calendar days.

            (b) Reservations of Rights. Nothing in this Note shall be deemed to
(i) limit the applicability of any otherwise applicable statutes of limitation
or repose and any waivers contained in this Note; or (ii) be a waiver by
Administrative Agent of the protection afforded to it by 12 U.S.C. Sec. 91 or
any substantially equivalent state law; or (iii) limit the right of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders (A) to exercise self help remedies such as
(but not limited to) setoff, or (B) to foreclose against any real or personal
property collateral, or (C) to obtain from a court provisional or ancillary
remedies such as (but not limited to) injunctive relief or the appointment of a
receiver. The Administrative Agent or the Lenders may exercise such self help
rights, foreclose upon such property, or obtain such provisional or ancillary
remedies before, during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding
brought pursuant to this Note. At the Administrative Agent's or the Lenders'
option, foreclosure under a deed of trust or mortgage may be accomplished by any
of the following: the exercise of a power of sale under the deed of trust or
mortgage, or by judicial sale under the deed of trust or mortgage, or by
judicial foreclosure. Neither the exercise of self help remedies nor the
institution or maintenance of an action for foreclosure or provisional or
ancillary remedies shall constitute a waiver of the right of any party,
including the claimant in any such action, to arbitrate the merits of the
controversy or claim occasioning resort to such remedies. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that the Administrative Agent or the Lenders exercise
such self help remedies or other actions, the Borrower has not waived any of its
rights to seek legal or equitable relief to defend against the Administrative
Agent's or the Lenders' exercise of such self help remedies or other actions. No
provision in the Financing Documents regarding submission to jurisdiction and/or
venue in any court is intended or shall be construed to be in derogation of the
provisions in any Financing Document for arbitration of any controversy or
claim.

            (c) Confidentiality. Any arbitration proceeding, award, findings of
fact, conclusions of law, or other information concerning such arbitration
matters shall be held in confidence by the parties and shall not be disclosed
except to each party's employees or agents as shall be reasonably necessary for
such party to conduct its business; provided, however, that either party may
disclose such information for auditing purposes by independent certified public


                                       97

accountants, for complying with applicable governmental laws, regulations or
court orders, or that is or becomes part of the public domain through no breach
of this Note.

      12.   Consent to Jurisdiction.

      The Borrower irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the Commonwealth of Virginia over any suit, action, or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Note. The Borrower irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that the Borrower
may now or hereafter have to the laying the venue of any such suit, action, or
proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action,
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Final judgment in any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any
such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower and may be enforced
in any court in which the Borrower is subject to jurisdiction by a suit upon
such judgment provided that service of process is effected upon the Borrower as
provided in this Note or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

      13.   Service of Process.

            (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Wayne G.
Tatusko, Esquire of Watt, Tieder, Hoffar & Fitzgerald, 7929 Westpark Drive,
McLean, Virginia 22102, as the Borrower's authorized agent to accept and
acknowledge on the Borrower's behalf service of any and all process that may be
served in any suit, action, or proceeding instituted in connection with this
Note in any state or federal court sitting in the Commonwealth of Virginia. If
such agent shall cease so to act, the Borrower shall irrevocably designate and
appoint without delay another such agent in the Commonwealth of Virginia
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and shall promptly deliver to the
Administrative Agent evidence in writing of such agent's acceptance of such
appointment and its agreement that such appointment shall be irrevocable.

            (d) The Borrower hereby consents to process being served in any
suit, action, or proceeding instituted in connection with this Note by (i) the
mailing of a copy thereof by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to the Borrower and (ii) serving a copy thereof upon the agent
hereinabove designated and appointed by the Borrower as the Borrower's agent for
service of process. The Borrower irrevocably agrees that such service shall be
deemed to be service of process upon the Borrower in any such suit, action, or
proceeding. Nothing in this Note shall affect the right of the Administrative
Agent to serve process in any manner otherwise permitted by law and nothing in
this Note will limit the right of the Administrative Agent otherwise to bring
proceedings against the Borrower in the courts of any jurisdiction or
jurisdictions.

14.   WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY.

      THE BORROWER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING NOT REQUIRED TO BE ARBITRATED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS
HEREOF TO WHICH THE BORROWER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, OR EITHER OF THEM,
MAY BE PARTIES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY PERTAINING TO (A) THIS NOTE, (B)
THE OTHER FINANCING DOCUMENTS OR (C) ANY OF THE PROPERTY. IT IS AGREED AND
UNDERSTOOD


                                       98
<PAGE>   105
THAT THIS WAIVER CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST ALL
PARTIES TO SUCH ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST PARTIES WHO ARE
NOT PARTIES TO THIS NOTE. THIS WAIVER IS KNOWINGLY, WILLINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY
MADE BY THE BORROWER, AND THE BORROWER HEREBY REPRESENTS THAT NO REPRESENTATIONS
OF FACT OR OPINION HAVE BEEN MADE BY ANY INDIVIDUAL TO INDUCE THIS WAIVER OF
TRIAL BY JURY OR TO IN ANY WAY MODIFY OR NULLIFY ITS EFFECT. THE BORROWER
FURTHER REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED IN THE SIGNING OF THIS NOTE AND
IN THE MAKING OF THIS WAIVER BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, SELECTED OF ITS OWN
FREE WILL, AND THAT IT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS WAIVER WITH
COUNSEL.

      15.   Expenses.

      The Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand by the
Administrative Agent all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
in connection with the collection and enforcement of this Note, including,
without limitation, all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and all court
costs.

      16.   Notices.

      Any notice, request, or demand to or upon the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have been properly given or made when
delivered in accordance with Section 11.1 of the Financing Agreement.

      17.   Miscellaneous.

      Each right, power, and remedy of the Administrative Agent as provided for
in this Note or any of the other Financing Documents, or now or hereafter
existing under any applicable law or otherwise shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power, or remedy
provided for in this Note or any of the other Financing Documents or now or
hereafter existing under any applicable law, and the exercise or beginning of
the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any one or more of such rights,
powers, or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the
Administrative Agent of any or all such other rights, powers, or remedies. No
failure or delay by the Administrative Agent to insist upon the strict
performance of any term, condition, covenant, or agreement of this Note or any
of the other Financing Documents, or to exercise any right, power, or remedy
consequent upon a breach thereof, shall constitute a waiver of any such term,
condition, covenant, or agreement or of any such breach, or preclude the
Administrative Agent from exercising any such right, power, or remedy at a later
time or times. By accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to waive the right
either to require prompt payment when due of all other amounts payable under the
terms hereof or to declare an Event of Default for the failure to effect such
prompt payment of any such other amount. No course of dealing or conduct shall
be effective to amend, modify, waive, release, or change any provisions of this
Note.

      18.   Partial Invalidity.

      In the event any provision of this Note (or any part of any provision) is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision (or remaining part of the affected
provision) of this Note; but this Note shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable provision (or part thereof) had not been contained in
this Note, but only to the extent it is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.

                               (((Project Name)))

      THIS JOINDER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made this ((Date of
