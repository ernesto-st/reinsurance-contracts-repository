Provisions"), and as soon as practicable, drafts of the proposed Credit
Agreement and each of the other documents related thereto. Within 10 Business
Days after the receipt of such term sheet and drafts of the Further Provisions,
the Alcatel Administrative Agent and the Qualcomm Administrative Agent shall
notify the Company, the Additional Senior Indebtedness Lender, the Collateral
Agent and each other such Administrative Agent whether they (acting on behalf
of, and at the instructions of, the Senior Lenders under their respective Credit
Agreements) agree to amend or supplement the provisions of this Agreement to
allow such Further Provisions to be incorporated herein; and, if either of them
(on behalf of the Senior Lenders under their respective Credit Agreements) so
agree, pursuant to the sole and absolute discretion of such Senior Lenders, this
Agreement shall be amended to include such Further Provisions and each party
hereto shall execute and deliver an amendment implementing such Further
Provisions, which amendment shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to each
such party; provided, that in no event shall any Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent be obligated to waive or modify any provision of the Financing
Agreements relating to the Collateral. If neither of such Administrative Agents
agrees to include such Further Provisions in this Agreement, such Further
Provisions may be included in the Credit Agreement under which such Additional
Senior Indebtedness is to be incurred and an "event of default" thereunder shall
constitute an Event of Default hereunder as set forth in Section 7.15. Any and
all Further Provisions related to any Additional Senior Indebtedness, which
Further Provisions were included in this Agreement pursuant to this Section
2.04(b), shall terminate, and this Agreement shall be amended to delete such
Further Provisions, upon the full refinancing of all of the obligations under
such related Additional Senior Indebtedness; provided, that if at the time of
any such refinancing, the Senior Indebtedness under either of the Alcatel Credit
Agreement or the Qualcomm Credit Agreement have been syndicated or participated
such


                                       4
<PAGE>
that any of the commitments or outstanding obligations thereunder have been sold
without credit support from Alcatel or its Affiliates or QUALCOMM or its
Affiliates, as applicable, such Further Provisions shall remain in this
Agreement for the term hereof; provided further, that no Further Provisions
shall terminate as described above to the extent such Further Provisions are
included within the instruments or agreements pursuant to which such related
Additional Senior Indebtedness is refinanced. Each of QUALCOMM and Alcatel shall
be permitted to exercise their rights under this Section 2.04(b) any number of
times of so long as QUALCOMM or Alcatel, as the case may be, shall be a Senior
Lender or shall be providing credit support to any Senior Lender with respect to
the Senior Indebtedness of such Senior Lender.

             (c) Any and all liens, collateral assignments, security interests
and charges which are to be given by the Borrower Group or their shareholders in
connection with such Additional Senior Indebtedness ("Additional Collateral")
shall be granted to the Collateral Agent (and the Security Documents shall be
amended or supplemented accordingly, or further security documents shall be
executed and delivered by the Borrower Group to grant such Additional Collateral
to the Collateral Agent), so that, following the issuance of such Additional
Senior Indebtedness, all of the Senior Indebtedness will be secured on a pari
passu basis.

             (d) Each member of the Borrower Group shall execute and deliver a
Guaranty Agreement in favor of the Additional Senior Indebtedness Lender in such
a manner that the Additional Senior Indebtedness is guaranteed thereunder to the
same extent as the other Senior Indebtedness at the time outstanding is
guaranteed; provided, however, that, the Company may arrange for a guaranty or
guarantees of such Additional Senior Indebtedness from a third party or parties,
other than other members of the Borrower Group (a "Third Party Guarantor")
without providing for a similar guaranty or guarantees of other Senior
Indebtedness, so long as (i) any representations, warranties, covenants or
defaults included in any reimbursement or similar agreement between any member
of the Borrower Group and the Third Party Guarantor shall constitute Further
Provisions for purposes of clause (b) of this Section 2.04, and (ii) no
collateral or other security may be given to such Third Party Guarantor by any
member of the Borrower Group other than in respect of subrogation rights, if
any, which such Third Party Guarantor may have in the Collateral and the
Security Documents, if and to the extent that it makes payments under such
guaranty.

             (e) At least five days prior to the issuance of the Additional
Senior Indebtedness, the Borrower Group shall have delivered to each
Administrative Agent a certificate (i) describing such Additional Senior
Indebtedness, (ii) stating that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is then continuing hereunder after giving full effect to the incurrence of such
Additional Senior Indebtedness, and (iii) stating that, following such issuance,
the Borrower Group will be in compliance with the provisions of this Section
2.04 and with the provisions of Section 6.04(d).

             (f) All of the conditions precedent to the Initial Disbursement
under the applicable Credit Agreement for such proposed Additional Senior

below.

             (b) Any prepayment of the principal amounts of any Senior
Indebtedness (other than (i) a prepayment of Non-Vendor Financing, (ii) a
prepayment of vendor financing from financing provided or supported by an export
credit agency or (iii) a prepayment made under a revolving credit or similar
facility, including a voluntary prepayment of a Loan the proceeds of which were
used for the payment of VAT, provided that the lender's commitment thereunder is
not permanently reduced at the time of such prepayment) shall be accompanied by
a prepayment, on a Pro Rata Payment basis, of the principal amounts of all other
Senior Indebtedness then outstanding, (which prepayments shall be made
simultaneously unless any such Senior Indebtedness does not permit such
prepayment at such time or would otherwise require a prepayment or break-funding
penalty, in which case such prepayment amounts, at the option of the Company,
may be deposited with the applicable Administrative Agent, invested in Permitted
Investments, and applied to the prepayment of such Senior Indebtedness on the
first date permitted or as to which no prepayment or break-funding penalty would
be imposed) which prepayment (unless the option described in the foregoing
parenthetical shall be exercised) shall be accompanied by the full payment of
any prepayment premium, break-funding amounts or other amounts due and payable
under the applicable Credit Agreement in connection with such prepayment;
provided, that (x) no such prepayment of any other Senior Indebtedness shall be
required if the Senior Lenders holding such Senior Indebtedness agree to waive
such prepayment or if the Credit Agreement governing such Senior Indebtedness
does not permit such prepayment and (y) the amount of the Senior Indebtedness
which would be so prepaid (but for the foregoing clause (x)) shall not be
applied to the other Senior Indebtedness then outstanding.

             (c) Any prepayment of principal on any Senior Indebtedness as
described in Section 2.05(b) shall be accompanied in each case with the full
payment of all accrued and unpaid interest on such Senior Indebtedness to the

             (d) Subject to SECTION 2.05(b), any prepayment of any Senior
Indebtedness which is made from the proceeds of other Indebtedness ("Refinancing
Indebtedness") may be made on a non-Pro Rata Payment basis between or among
Senior Indebtedness; provided, however, that the documentation under which such
Refinancing Indebtedness (other than Refinancing Indebtedness provided or
supported by an export credit agency) is issued shall provide that Senior
Indebtedness may be prepaid by the Company on a non-Pro-Rata Payment basis to
the same extent as is set forth in this Section 2.05.

        2.06 PAYMENTS.

             (a) On each Payment Date, the Company shall make the scheduled
principal repayments of Senior Indebtedness due on such Payment Date except to
the extent that such repayments have been prepaid. Principal of the Senior
Indebtedness shall be payable in accordance with the applicable Credit Agreement
on the terms and conditions set forth therein. If two or more Credit Agreements

                                       6
<PAGE>
Company shall not have sufficient funds on such date to make full payment of the
Senior Indebtedness amounts due on such date under the applicable Credit
Agreements, then the Company shall make payments to the Senior Lenders under

clause (z) of the proviso of the definition of "Pro Rata Payment") in respect of
the amounts due on such date.

             (b) On each Payment Date, the Company shall pay accrued and unpaid

             (c) All payments due under any Credit Agreement shall be made by
the Company pursuant to the terms of the applicable Credit Agreement, in
Dollars, as required under the applicable Credit Agreement, and in immediately

and Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant Administrative Agent shall apply each
payment with respect thereto received by it in accordance with such Credit
Agreement.

             (d) If at any time at which any Obligations are payable to a Senior
Lender such Senior Lender receives insufficient funds pursuant to the applicable
Credit Agreement to pay in full all Obligations payable to such Senior Lender at
such time, the funds so received by such Senior Lender at such time shall be
deemed to be applied as follows:

the Senior Indebtedness held by such Senior Lender;

                 (ii) SECOND, to principal of the Senior Indebtedness held by

all interest rate swap agreements shall be bona fide hedges of floating rate
exposure for a fixed rate obligation, shall have at any time a notional amount
not greater than the Company's floating rate Indebtedness outstanding at such
time, and cover a period not exceeding four years from any date of
determination; provided, further, that all currency swap agreements shall be
forward contracts, for a term not exceeding one year, for the purchase of
Dollars or Pesos with notional amounts in aggregate not exceeding the Company's
projected operating expenses coming due over the three month period following
the date upon which such currency swap agreement is entered. The Company may
incur obligations under the Swap Agreement without regard to any limitations
imposed under Section 2.04 or Section 6.04. The obligations of the Company under
any such Swap Agreement may, upon notice by the Company to the Collateral Agent,
be secured by the Collateral on a pro-


                                       7
<PAGE>
rata basis to the same extent as would be the case if such obligations of the
Company under such Swap Agreement were deemed to be Additional Senior
Indebtedness hereunder, in which event the Security Documents shall be amended
to the extent necessary to provide for such pro-rata treatment of the swap
counterparty in respect of such Collateral; provided, however, that in such
event (i) no member of the Borrower Group shall, if the swap counterparty is
secured as aforesaid, grant to such swap counterparty any other Lien upon the
property or assets of the Borrower Group, (ii) the amount secured by the
Collateral, as described in the preceding sentence, shall be the amount owed

counterparty, in its capacity as such, shall not otherwise be, or be deemed to

any matter described herein or in the other Financing Agreements. Upon delivery
of the notice to the Collateral Agent as aforesaid, accompanied by a certificate
of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company stating that no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Collateral Agent shall amend
or supplement the Security Documents to implement the provisions of this Section

deemed to be limited to those Applicable Laws in effect on the date such
representation is made.

        4.09 CAPITALIZATION.

             (a) Schedule 4.09 sets forth the capitalization of Holdings and
each other member of the Borrower Group as of the date hereof, including (i)
authorized capital, (ii) the number of shares issued and outstanding and (iii)
the shareholders and number of shares and advances held by each such
shareholder. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Holdings (other than
treasury stock held by Holdings) and each other member of the Borrower Group are
duly and validly issued and non-assessable and fully paid. Neither Holdings nor
any other member of the Borrower Group has outstanding (a) any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for its share capital or (b) except as set
forth in Section 4.09(b) below, any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or
any option for the purchase of, or any agreement, arrangement or understanding
providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or any call, commitment
or claims of any character relating to, or any rights or claims that restrict
the transfer of, its share capital.

             (b) The Existing Equity, as of September 29, 1998, was $300,000,000
(or the Peso Equivalent thereof, determined as of the date or dates of
contribution). No Existing Shareholder or New Shareholder has any right
(contingent or otherwise) for the repayment or reimbursement of any of the
Existing Equity, nor any rights, contractual or otherwise, against Holdings (or
any other member of the Borrower Group) in respect of such Existing Equity,
other than rights to the shares of Capital Stock which have previously been
issued to the providers of such Existing Equity. Each of the Equity Commitments
constitutes the valid and enforceable obligation of the Original Mexican
Shareholders to subscribe for the Capital Stock of Holdings in the amounts and
on the date or dates specified in such Equity Commitments, and each such
obligation is (i) absolute and irrevocable, and (ii) not subject (directly or
indirectly) to any precondition or condition precedent except as set forth in
the Joint Venture Agreement. As of the date this representation is made (i)
there has been no amendment, supplement or modification of such Equity
Commitment, and (ii) there has been no waiver granted by Holdings under any such
Equity Commitment. Set forth in Schedule 4.09 is a true and complete listing of
each Original Mexican Shareholder and the amount of each Equity Commitment
required to be contributed by each such Original Mexican Shareholder as of the
Closing Date. The collateral assignments of the rights in respect of the Equity
Commitments by Holdings, the Company and the Sponsors to the Collateral Agent,
acting for the benefit of the Secured Parties, pursuant to the Assignment
Agreements are effective to allow the Collateral Agent to make demands
thereunder and to allow the Collateral Agent the right to enforce the
obligations of the Original Mexican Shareholders and Holdings, as applicable,
thereunder without any further action other than notice to the Original Mexican
Shareholders and Holdings, as applicable, and to commence appropriate legal
action on behalf of the Secured Parties against the Original Mexican
Shareholders and Holdings, as applicable.

        4.10 SUBSIDIARIES, MORTGAGE AND MINIMUM ASSETS.

             (a) Holdings is the legal and beneficial owner of 100% of the
Capital Stock of each of (i) the Company, (ii) Pegaso PCS and (iii) Personnel
Co. (the "Applicable Shares"). As of the Closing Date, Holdings does not own any
Capital Stock in any Person other than as set forth in the preceding sentence.
There are no Liens of any kind on any of the Applicable Shares other than
Permitted Liens, nor are there any restrictions on transfers of such


                                       19
<PAGE>

Applicable Shares, nor are there any agreements of any kind relating to the
voting of, or disposition of, such Applicable Shares (except as described in the
proviso to Section 4.04(iv)). As of the Closing Date, each of the Company,
Pegaso PCS and Personnel Co. has no Subsidiaries and does not otherwise control
any voting stock or any ownership interest in any other Person. All of the
Capital Stock of each Subsidiary of Holdings or of any other member of the
Borrower Group acquired after the date of this Agreement has been pledged by the
relevant party to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties as
required by Section 5.14. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section
4.10(a), it is recognized that a single share of each of Pegaso PCS, Personnel
Co. and the Company is not owned by Holdings, but is owned by another member of
the Borrower Group.

             (b) As of the Closing Date, the Sponsors, collectively, own 100% of
the Capital Stock of Holdings (the "Holdings Shares"). There are no liens of any
kind on the Holdings Shares other than Permitted Liens, nor (except for such
agreements or restrictions as are set forth in the Joint Venture Agreement, in
the form in existence on the Closing Date, and in the Registration Rights
Agreement referred to therein, and as otherwise described in the proviso to
Section 4.04 (iv)) are there any restrictions on transfer of the Holdings
Shares, nor are there any agreements of any kind relating to the voting of, or
disposition of, such Holdings Shares, other than as set forth in the Joint
Venture Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.

             (c) The Company is the legal and beneficial owner of all of the
properties, assets and contract rights which are specifically described in the
Mortgage as being the subject of the Lien created by the Mortgage. The Mortgage
has the effect of creating, in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of
the Senior Lenders, a perfected and first priority Lien on all property, assets
and contract rights owned from time to time by the Company (including property
acquired by the Company after the date of execution, delivery and recording of
the Mortgage). Such properties, assets and contract rights, at the time this
representation is made or deemed made, constitute Minimum Assets.

        4.11 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. Each member of the Borrower Group
is in compliance in all respects with all Applicable Law (including
Environmental Law), except to the extent that such failure to be in compliance
would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

        4.12 PROPERTY RIGHTS. Each member of the Borrower Group owns, has a
license to use or otherwise has the right to use, free and clear of any pending
or threatened Liens (other than Permitted Liens), all property rights (real,
personal and mixed, tangible and intangible) including all patents, patent
applications, trademarks, permits, service marks, names, trade secrets,
proprietary information and knowledge, technology, computer programs, databases,
copyrights, licenses, franchises and formulas, or rights with respect thereto,
and has obtained assignments of all leases and other rights of whatever nature,
in each case, that are material to the care, custody, control, construction,
development, operation and maintenance of the System or the conduct of the
Business by the Borrower Group as contemplated by the Business Plan, without any
conflict with the rights of others as of the date such property rights are
necessary to operate and maintain the System and the Business.

engaged in any business other than the care, custody, control, development,
construction, operation, maintenance and financing of the System and the conduct
of the Business; provided, that it is recognized that Personnel Co. is
authorized to provide human resource and similar services, and may provide such
services, to unrelated third parties to the extent consistent with the Original
Business Plan.

        4.14 FEES AND ENFORCEMENT.

             (a) Except for the fees and Taxes set forth on Schedule 4.14 that
have been paid in full or will have been paid in full by the date of any
Disbursement requested hereunder or with the proceeds of such Disbursement, no
fees or Taxes are required to be paid for the legality, validity or
enforceability of the Financing Agreements.

             (b) This Agreement and each of such Financing Agreements executed

respective governing laws selected in such Transaction Documents, for the
enforcement thereof in such jurisdiction.

the Borrower Group, any and all payments in the currency or currencies
contemplated by the Financing Agreements, (ii) the ability of the Borrower Group
to maintain Dollar accounts outside Mexico and to transfer amounts from and into
Mexico as necessary to meet its obligations under the Financing Agreements, in
accordance with their respective terms, and (iii) the ability of the Borrower
Group to use Dollars as necessary to perform all of its obligations under the
Financing Agreements, in accordance with their respective terms, including the
making of all payments contemplated in the Financing Agreements, have been duly
and validly obtained and are in full force and effect. Other than those
restrictions or requirements for which appropriate waivers, authorizations
and/or approvals have been received, there are no further restrictions or
requirements under Applicable Law which limit the availability or transfer of
foreign exchange, or the conversion to a foreign exchange, for the purpose of
(a) the performance by the Borrower Group of their obligations under this
Agreement or any other Financing Agreement or (b) repatriating the proceeds of
enforcement of the Obligations or the Collateral to the Collateral Agent.

        4.16 LIENS. Except for Permitted Liens, there are no Liens securing any
Indebtedness or other obligations of any Person covering any present or future
revenues, properties or assets or share capital of any member of the Borrower
Group. No member of the Borrower Group has outstanding any Lien or obligation to
create any Lien on or with respect to any of its properties, revenues or assets,
other than Permitted Liens.

        4.17 TITLE; SECURITY DOCUMENTS.

             (a) Each member of the Borrower Group holds good and legal title to

cases free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

             (b) The provisions of the Security Documents are effective to
create in favor of the Secured Parties a legal, valid and enforceable first
priority Lien on all of the property, assets and revenues described therein
(including, with respect to the Mortgage, any and all property, assets and
revenues specifically identified therein) to the extent a security interest may
be created therein under Applicable Law and all necessary and appropriate
recordings, registrations and filings have been made in all appropriate public
offices, and all other necessary and appropriate action has been taken so that
each such Security Document creates an effective Lien with respect to the
property, assets, contract rights and revenues covered thereby to the extent a
security interest may be created therein under Applicable Law, prior and
superior to all other Liens except for Permitted Liens, and consents to the
creation, effectiveness, priority and enforcement of such Liens have been
obtained from each of the parties to the Transaction Documents and the relevant
Governmental Authorities, other than as described in the proviso to Section
4.04(iv).

        4.18 TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. The Collateral Agent and each Administrative

material respects (i) in the case of the Original Business Plan, as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) with respect to all other factual information (including
updates of the Business Plan), on the dates as of which such information was
furnished, and was not incomplete by omitting to state any material fact
necessary to make such information (taken as a whole) not misleading in any
material respect at such time in light of the circumstances under which such
information was furnished; provided, however, that, except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the sole representation of each member of

other expressions of view as to future circumstances (i) were prepared in good
faith, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the Borrower Group's

assumptions or conclusions in the Business Plan, as of the date of delivery
thereof, which are based upon or include information known as such delivery date

those set forth in the Licenses. The Licenses are sufficient (together with
other authorizations, consents and permits which have been received, or are

imposed.

scheduled principal coming due on, High Yield Debt (issued by Holdings) within
such five Business Day-period (and any Dividends not so utilized within such
five Business Day-period shall be returned to the appropriate Subsidiary of
Holdings) and (iv) to the extent no Default or Event of Default exists at the
time of such payment, dividends by Holdings which are permitted to be paid

EBITDA shall be measured based on the two preceding fiscal quarters most
recently ended, and (3) simultaneously with any such Dividend payment, there
shall be paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, as a prepayment of the
principal amount of such Senior Indebtedness then outstanding and on a Pro Rata
Payment basis, an amount equal to such Dividend multiplied by the ratio
(expressed as a percentage of not less than 100%) which (i) the total principal
amount of Senior Indebtedness outstanding on the date of such prepayment bears
to (ii) the total Consolidated Paid In Equity as of such date, both calculated

thereof at such time or under such circumstances as are described in this

prepayment of any such Senior Indebtedness would require a prepayment or
break-funding penalty, such prepayment amounts may, at the option of the

            (f) Each Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.01(b) and (c)

action shall not release the Borrower Group from any liability which it may have
to such Indemnified Party.

        8.02 RIGHT OF SETOFF. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Senior Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time

the credit or the account of any member of the Borrower Group against any and
all of the obligations of the Borrower Group now or hereafter existing under the
applicable Credit Agreement and, if applicable, the corresponding Note held by
such Senior Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Senior Lender shall have
made any demand under the applicable Credit Agreement or Note, and without

Group, all of which are hereby expressly waived and although such obligations
may be unmatured.

        8.03 NOTICES.

             (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any
Financing Agreement, all notices and other communications provided for hereunder
or thereunder shall be (i) in writing (including telex or telecopier) and (ii)

inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and
assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, no member of the Borrower
Group may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of each of the Senior Lenders. Any Senior Lender may
transfer, assign or grant its rights hereunder in connection with an assignment
or transfer of all or any part of its interest in its Senior Indebtedness in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable Credit Agreement; provided that
any such assignee has agreed to be bound by the terms of the Financing
Agreements, including the Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any Financing Agreement (including this Agreement),
the Senior Lenders under each respective Credit Agreement shall be entitled to
appoint a successor administrative agent in accordance with the terms of such
Credit Agreement upon the resignation or removal of their Administrative Agent
without any consent of or notice to any other Secured Party, and upon such
appointment becoming effective in accordance with such terms, such successor
shall be deemed to be the "Administrative Agent" of such Senior Lenders for all
purposes of this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements. Each of the
Relevant Parties shall be deemed a third party beneficiary to this Agreement to
the extent that it is to receive any document, instrument, notification or other
paper as provided herein.

        8.05 NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the part of
the Collateral Agent, any other Agent, or any Senior Lender in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Financing Agreement and
no course of dealing between any member of the Borrower Group, or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Collateral Agent, any other Agent and the
Senior Lenders, on the other hand, shall impair any such right, power or
privilege or operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Financing
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege hereunder of thereunder. The rights, powers and
remedies herein or in any other Financing Agreement expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which any party
thereto would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on a member of the Borrower
Group in any case shall entitle such member (or any other member) to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of the Collateral Agent, any other Agent, or any Senior
Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or
demand.

        8.06 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of any Financing Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the



                                       54
<PAGE>
extent of prohibition or unenforceability, but that shall not invalidate the
remaining provisions of such Financing Agreement or affect such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

        8.07 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which, when executed and delivered, shall be effective for purposes of
binding the parties hereto, but all of which shall together constitute one and
the same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto
shall be lodged with each of the parties hereto.

        8.08 EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall become effective on the date
hereof. Any Credit Agreement shall become effective pursuant to its terms
(except for this Agreement having become effective, if that is a condition of
effectiveness of any of such agreement).

        8.09 SURVIVAL. All indemnities set forth herein, including in Section
8.01, shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making
and repayment of the Senior Indebtedness.

        8.10 CURRENCY OF PAYMENT. The obligation of the Company and the Borrower
Group to pay in Dollars those amounts of the sums specified to be due in
Dollars, under this Agreement or the respective Financing Agreements (the
"Financing Agreement Currency") shall not be deemed to have been novated,
discharged or satisfied by any tender of (or recovery under judgment expressed
in) any currency other than the Financing Agreement Currency, except to the
extent to which such tender (or recovery) shall result in the effective payment
of such aggregate amount in the applicable Financing Agreement Currency at the
place where such payment is to be made and, accordingly, the amount (if any) by
which any such tender (or recovery) shall fall short of such amount shall be and
remain due to the Senior Lenders as a separate Obligation, unaffected by
judgment having been obtained (if such is the case) for any other amounts due in
respect of this Agreement or the Financing Agreements.

        8.11 JUDGMENT CURRENCY.

             (a) The obligations of the Borrower Group hereunder and under the
other Financing Agreements to make payments in Dollars (the "Obligation
Currency"), shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery
pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than
the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery
results in the effective receipt by the respective Secured Party of the full
amount of the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to such Secured Party
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. If for the purpose of
obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Company in any court or in any
jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other
than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to
as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the
conversion shall be made at the Peso Equivalent, in the case of Pesos, and in
the case of other currencies, the rate of exchange (as quoted by the
Intercreditor Agent or if the Intercreditor Agent fails to quote a rate of
exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such currency designated by the
Intercreditor Agent) determined, in each case, as of the day on which the
judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the
"Judgment Currency Conversion Date").



                                       55
<PAGE>
             (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between
the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the
amount due, the Borrower Group covenants to pay, or cause to be paid, such
additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may be
necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial
award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.

             (c) For purposes of determining the Peso Equivalent or rate of
exchange under this Section 8.11, such amounts shall include any premium and
costs payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

        8.12 EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

             (a) Each Senior Lender shall maintain, or cause to be maintained,
in accordance with its usual practice, internal records evidencing the amounts
from time to time lent by and owing to it under its respective Financing
Agreement and each of the payments from time to time made in respect thereof.

             (b) Except as otherwise provided in any Financing Agreement, in any
legal action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with any Financing
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the entries made in the internal
records maintained by each of the Senior Lenders pursuant to clause (a) above
shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amount of obligations of the
Borrower Group as therein recorded.

        8.13 ENGLISH LANGUAGE This Agreement is made in the English language.
One Spanish language translation of this Agreement prepared at the Company's
expense by an official public interpreter and approved by Mexican counsel to the
Company and Mexican counsel to the Senior Lenders under the Alcatel Credit
Agreement and the Qualcomm Credit Agreement shall be the agreed Spanish language
translation hereof for all purposes. Such translation and no other may be filed
in one or more public registries in Mexico or used in any proceeding in Mexico.
For all purposes, the English language version hereof shall be the original
instrument and in all cases of conflict between the English and the Spanish
versions, the English version shall control.

        8.14 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the exhibits, schedules
and appendices attached hereto), including the documents referred to herein,
embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings of the parties hereto
relating to the subject matter herein contained.

        8.15 WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. Each member of the Borrower Group
acknowledges and agrees that the activities contemplated by the provisions of
the Financing Agreements are commercial in nature rather than governmental or
public, and therefore acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to any
right of immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise with respect to
such activities or in any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to the Financing Agreements. Each member of the Borrower Group, in



                                       56
<PAGE>

respect of itself, its process agents, and its properties and revenues,
expressly and irrevocably waives any such right of immunity which may now or
hereafter exist (including any immunity from any legal process, from the
jurisdiction of any court or from any execution or attachment in aid of
execution prior to judgment or otherwise) or claim thereto which may now or
hereafter exist, and agrees not to assert any such right or claim in any such
action or proceeding, whether in the United States or otherwise.

        8.16 REINSTATEMENT. This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the
obligations of the Company or the Borrower Group hereunder, or any part thereof,
is, pursuant to Applicable. Law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party.
In the event that any payment or any part thereof is so rescinded, reduced,
restored or returned, such obligations shall be reinstated and deemed reduced
only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, restored or returned.

        8.17 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL.

             (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the law of the State of New York, United States, without

General Obligations Laws of the State of New York); provided, however, that, in
connection with any legal action or proceeding (other than an action to enforce
a judgment obtained in another jurisdiction) brought in respect to this
Agreement in the courts of Mexico or any political subdivision thereof, this
Agreement shall be deemed to be an instrument made under the laws of Mexico and
for such purposes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the Federal District of Mexico.

             (b) Each party hereto hereby agrees that any suit, action or

York sitting in New York County (including its Appellate Division), or in any
other appellate court in the State of New York or the competent courts of the
Federal District of Mexico, as the party commencing such suit, action or
proceeding may elect in its sole discretion; and each party hereto hereby
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any
such suit, action, proceeding or judgment. Each party hereto further submits,
for the purpose of any such suit, action, proceeding or judgment brought or
rendered against it, to the appropriate courts of the jurisdiction of its
domicile. Each member of the Borrower Group hereby waives any rights to a
specific jurisdiction it may have by virtue of its present or any future
domicile, or otherwise.

             (c) Each member of the Borrower Group hereby agrees that service of
all writs, process and summonses in any such suit, action or proceeding brought
in the State of New York may be made upon CT Corporation System, presently
located at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019, U.S.A. (the "Process

the Process Agent has been duly and irrevocably appointed as its agent and true
and lawful attorney-in-fact in its name, place and stead to accept such service
of any and all such writs, process and summonses, and agrees that the failure of
the



                                       57
<PAGE>

Process Agent to give any notice of any such service of process to such member
of the Borrower Group shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or
of any judgment based thereon. Each member of the Borrower Group hereby further
irrevocably consents to the service of process in any suit, action or proceeding
in said courts by the mailing thereof by any Secured Party by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address set forth beneath its signature
hereto.

             (d) Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability
of the Secured Parties to serve any such writs, process or summonses in any
other manner permitted by applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over any
