<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR
GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Arch Capital Group&nbsp;Ltd. (the "Company"), a Bermuda company, hereby grants to Paul B. Ingrey, an
employee of the Company on the date hereof (the "Option Holder"), the option to purchase common shares, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Shares"), upon the following terms: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Option Holder has been granted the following award in connection with his retention as an employee and as compensation for services to be rendered; and the following terms
reflect the Company's Long Term Incentive Plan for New Employees (the "Plan"); </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Grant. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The Option Holder is hereby granted an option (the "Option") to purchase 422,407 Shares (the "Option Shares")
pursuant to the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Option is granted as of October&nbsp;23, 2001 (the "Date of Grant") and such grant is subject to the terms and
conditions herein and the terms and conditions of the applicable provisions of the Plan. This Option shall not be treated as an incentive stock option as defined in Section&nbsp;422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Status of Option Shares. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The Option Shares shall upon issue rank equally in all respects with the other Shares. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Option Price. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The purchase price for the Option Shares shall be, except as herein provided, $20.00 per Option Share,
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Option Price," payable immediately in full upon the exercise of the Option. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Term of Option. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The Option may be exercised only during the period (the "Option Period") set forth in
paragraph&nbsp;(f) below and shall remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant. Thereafter, the Option Holder shall cease to have any rights in respect thereof. The right to
exercise the Option shall be subject to sooner termination in the event employment with the Company is terminated, as provided in paragraph&nbsp;(j) below. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>No Rights of Shareholder. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The Option Holder shall not, by virtue hereof, be entitled to any rights of a shareholder in
the Company, either at law or in equity. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Exercisability. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Except as otherwise set forth in paragraph&nbsp;(j) below, the Option shall become exercisable as to
one third of the Option Shares beginning on the earlier of (A)&nbsp;the date on which the closing occurs under the Subscription Agreement with new investors entered into substantially simultaneously
with the execution of this agreement or (B)&nbsp;the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, and as to an additional one-third of the Option Shares on the first anniversary of the Date
of Grant, and as to the final one-third of the Option Shares on the second anniversary of the Date of Grant, in each case subject to paragraph&nbsp;(j) below. Subject to
paragraph&nbsp;(j) below, the Option may be exercised at any time or from time to time during the Option Period in regard to all or any portion of the Option which is then exercisable, as may be
adjusted pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(g) below. </FONT></P>

subject to the unexercised Option the number and kind of shares, other securities or other consideration (including cash) into which each outstanding Share shall be changed or for which each such
Share shall
be exchanged, and (ii)&nbsp;the exercise price shall be increased or decreased proportionately so that the aggregate purchase price for the Shares subject to the unexercised Option shall remain the
same as immediately prior to such event. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Nontransferability. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The Option, or any interest therein, may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, disposed of or
encumbered by the Option Holder, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During the lifetime of the Option Holder, the Option shall be exercisable only by the Option Holder or
by his or her guardian or legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may be transferred by the Option Holder to members of his or her "immediate family "or to a trust or other
entity established for the exclusive benefit of solely one or more members of the Option Holder's "immediate family." Any Option held by the transferee will continue to be subject to the same terms
and conditions that were applicable to the Option immediately prior to the transfer, except that the Option will be transferable by the transferee only by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
For purposes hereof, "immediate family" means the Option Holder's children stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, spouse, siblings (including half brother and sisters), in
laws, and relationships arising because of legal adoption. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Exercise of Option. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>In order to exercise the Option, the Option Holder shall submit to the Company an instrument in
writing signed by the Option Holder, specifying the whole number of Option Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised, accompanied by payment, in a manner acceptable to the Company, of
the Option Price for the Option Shares for which the Option is being exercised. Payment to the Company in cash or Shares already owned by the Option Holder (provided that the Option Holder has owned
such Shares for a minimum period of six months or has purchased such Shares on the open market) and having a total Fair Market Value (as defined below) equal to the exercise price, or in a combination
of cash and such Shares, shall be deemed acceptable for purposes hereof. Option Shares will be issued accordingly by the Company within 15 business days, and a share certificate dispatched to the
Option Holder within 30&nbsp;days. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall not be required to issue fractional Shares upon the exercise of the Option. If any fractional interest in a Share would be deliverable upon the exercise of the Option
in whole or in part but for the provisions of this paragraph, the Company, in lieu of delivering any such fractional share therefor, shall pay a cash adjustment therefor in an amount equal to their
Fair Market Value (or if any Shares are not publicly traded, an amount equal to the book value per share at the end of the most recent fiscal quarter) multiplied by the fraction of the fractional
share which would otherwise have been issued hereunder. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Option Shares hereunder if the issuance of such
Option Shares would violate the provision of any applicable law, in which event the Company shall, as soon as practicable, take whatever action it reasonably can so that such Option Shares may be
issued without resulting in such violations of law. For purposes hereof, Fair Market Value shall mean the mean between the high and low selling prices per Share on the immediately preceding date (or,
if the Shares were not traded on that day, the next preceding day that the Shares were traded) on the principal exchange on which the Shares are traded, as such prices are officially quoted on such
exchange. </FONT></P>

any other reason, except due to a termination of the Option Holder's employment by the Company for Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement), the Option, to the extent then vested and
exercisable, may be exercised for 90&nbsp;days following termination of employment (but not beyond the Option Period). In the event of a termination of the Option Holder's employment for Cause, the
Option shall immediately cease to be exercisable and shall be immediately forfeited. To the extent the Option is not vested at the time of termination of employment, the Option shall be immediately
forfeited. For purposes of this Option, service with any of the Company's Subsidiaries (as defined in the Plan) shall be considered to be service with the Company. </FONT></P>
