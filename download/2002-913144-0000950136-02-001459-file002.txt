     be:

               (a) "controlled by" any other Person if such other Person
          possesses, directly or indirectly, power: (i) to vote 20% or more of
          the securities having at the time of any determination hereunder
          voting power for the election of directors of such Person; or (ii) to

     Authority for the 2001 Annual Statements. If such format is changed in
     future years so that different information is contained in such items or
     they no longer exist, it is understood that the reference is to information

     Statement of such Subsidiary.

          "Applicable Lending Office" means, with respect to each Lender, such
     Lender's Domestic Lending Office in the case of a Base Rate Advance and

     Moody's shall have in effect a Public Debt Rating, the Applicable Margin
     and the Applicable Percentage shall be determined by reference to the
     available rating; (b) if neither S&P nor Moody's shall have in effect a
     Public Debt Rating, the Applicable Margin and the Applicable Percentage
     will be set two levels below the Financial Strength Rating for DaVinci
     Reinsurance Ltd. issued by either S&P or Moody's (e.g., a Financial
     Strength Rating of "A" issued by S&P would equate to an implied senior
     unsecured debt rating of BBB+ ); (c) if the ratings established by S&P and
     Moody's shall fall within different levels, the Applicable Margin and the
     Applicable Percentage shall be based upon the higher rating, unless the
     difference between such ratings is two or more levels, in which case the
     Applicable Margin and the Applicable Percentage shall be based upon the
     rating that is one level below the higher of such ratings; (d) if any
     rating established by S&P or Moody's shall be changed, such change shall be
     effective as of the date on which such change is first announced publicly
     by the rating agency making such change; and (e) if S&P or Moody's shall
     change the basis on which ratings are established, each reference to the
     Public Debt Rating announced by S&P or Moody's, as the case may be, shall
     refer to the then equivalent rating by S&P or Moody's, as the case may be.

          "Register" has the meaning specified in Section 8.07(d).

                                   ARTICLE II

                        AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES

     SECTION 2.01. The Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to the Borrower from time to
time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the
Termination Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
such Lender's Commitment. Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall
consist of Advances of the same Type made on the same day by the Lenders ratably
according to their respective Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender's
Commitment, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to
Section 2.09 and reborrow under this Section 2.01.

     SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (a) Each Borrowing shall be made on
notice, given not later than (x) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a
Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances or (y) 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the first Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing
in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by the Borrower to
the Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier
or telex. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "Notice of Borrowing") shall be by
telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telecopier or telex in
substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i)
date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii)
aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing
consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest Period for each such
Advance. Each Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date
of such Borrowing make available for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's
ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and
upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the
Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's address
referred to in Section 8.02.

     (b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i)
the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the
aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $5,000,000 or if the obligation
of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant
to Section 2.07 or 2.11 and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate Advances may not be
outstanding as part of more than six separate Borrowings.

     (c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing
specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall
indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender
as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such
Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance,
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

     (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such
Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such
Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the
Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.



                                       12
<PAGE>

     (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part
of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any,
hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be
made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.03. Fees. (a) Upfront Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Agent for the account of each Lender an upfront fee equal to 0.05% of such
Lender's Commitment on the Effective Date, payable on the Effective Date.

     (b) Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account
of each Lender a commitment fee on the aggregate amount of such Lender's unused
Commitment from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and from the
effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at a
rate per annum equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time,
payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing June 30, 2002, and on the Termination Date.


     (c) Agent's Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for its own account
such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the Borrower and the Agent.

     SECTION 2.04. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Optional.
The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to
the Agent, to terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably in part the
unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders, provided that each
partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

          (b) Mandatory. On the second anniversary of the Effective Date, if the
     Required Lenders have made the amortization election in accordance with
     Section 2.05 prior to such date, and on each date that is three months
     after such second anniversary, the Commitments of the Lenders shall be
     automatically and permanently reduced on a pro rata basis by $10,000,000 on
     each such date.

     SECTION 2.05. Repayment of Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Agent
for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate
principal amount of the Advances then outstanding. In addition, if the Agent, at
the direction of the Required Lenders, gives the Borrower notice not later than
60 days prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date that the
Commitments of the Lenders will amortize as set forth in Section 2.04(b), the
Borrower shall, on each Business Day, repay to the Agent for the ratable account
of the Lenders the amount by which the aggregate principal amount of the
Advances exceeds the aggregate Commitments after giving effect to such reduction
on such day, together with accrued interest to the date of such payment on the
principal amount so repaid.

     SECTION 2.06. Interest on Advances. (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower
shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each
Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid
in full, at the following rates per annum:

          (i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a Base
     Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (x) the
     Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the Applicable Margin in
     effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of
     each March, June, September and December during such periods and on the
     date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

          (ii) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is
     a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each
     Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar Rate for
     such Interest Period for such Advance plus (y) the Applicable Margin in
     effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the last day of such
     Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than
     three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every
     three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date
     such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.



                                       13
<PAGE>

     (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders
shall, require the Borrower to pay interest ("Default Interest") on (i) the
unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender, payable in arrears
on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, at a rate per annum
equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid
on such Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount
payable hereunder that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be
due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such
amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all
times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on Base Rate
Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above, provided, however, that following
acceleration of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01, Default Interest shall
accrue and be payable hereunder whether or not previously required by the Agent.

     SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Citibank agrees to furnish
to the Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar
Rate. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the
applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section
2.06(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by Citibank for the purpose
of determining the interest rate under Section 2.06(a)(ii).

     (b) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Required Lenders
notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for such
Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of
making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the
Lenders, whereupon (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance, and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances
into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify
the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.

     (c) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions
contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Agent will
forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
Convert into Base Rate Advances.

     (d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment
or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

     (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
(i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended.

     (f) If Telerate Markets Page 3750 (or any successor page) is unavailable
and Citibank shall fail to furnish timely information to the Agent for
determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advances,

          (i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and the Lenders that
     the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurodollar Rate Advances,

          (ii) each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last
     day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
     Advance (or if any Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a
     Base Rate Advance), and

          (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances
     or to Convert Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended
     until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
     circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.



                                       14
<PAGE>

     SECTION 2.08. Optional Conversion of Advances. The Borrower may on any
Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.07 and 2.11, Convert all
Advances of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other
Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into
Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount
specified in Section 2.02(b) and no Conversion of any Advances shall result in
more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice
of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the
date of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such
Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial
Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

     SECTION 2.09. Prepayments of Advances. The Borrower may, upon notice at
least three Business Days' prior to the date of such prepayment, in the case of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, and not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on
the date of such prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Agent
stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and
if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal
amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably
in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a
Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).

     SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs. (a) If, after the Effective Date, due to
either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any
law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any
central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make
or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances (excluding for
purposes of this Section 2.10 any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes
or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.13 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the
basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United
States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such
Lender is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof), then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by
such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the
account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender
for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost,
submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

     (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or
any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law) introduced after the Effective Date
affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that
the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such
Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to
time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the
extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be
allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder. A
certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such
Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

     (c) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred
more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower and
the Agent of any event described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section (a
"Change in Law") which gives rise to such increased costs and of such Lender's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs is retroactive, then the 90-day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.



                                       15
<PAGE>

     SECTION 2.11. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful,
or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations
hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Advances hereunder, (a) each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender will
automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (b) the
obligation of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to Convert
Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall
notify the Borrower and such Lender that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist.

     SECTION 2.12. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make each
payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not
later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to
the Agent at the Agent's Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.13 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their
respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of
any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and
recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to
Section 8.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment
and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes
in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder,
and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate
adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly
between themselves.

     (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent
payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under the Note
held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the
Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.

     (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by
the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all
computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate
and of fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in
each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding
the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are
payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

     (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be
due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or fee, as the case may be;
provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or
principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar
month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

     (e) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to
the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower
will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such
due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent,
each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

     SECTION 2.13. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the
account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under the Notes or any other
documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Section
2.12 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its
overall net income, and taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each
Lender,


                                       16
<PAGE>

taxes imposed on its overall net income, and taxes imposed on it in lieu of net
income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or
any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments
hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable hereunder or under any Note or any other documents to be delivered
hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or any
other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
or the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold it
harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 2.13) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall
be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) makes written demand therefor.

     (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent
such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof
that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

     (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other
Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by
the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so),
shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal
Revenue Service forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or
other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such
Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding
tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. If the form provided by
a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement
indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero,
withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and
until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate
applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered
excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; provided, however, that,
if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender
assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to
payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with
respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes
shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the
future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding
tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any
form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of
information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and
information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN
or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender
shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include
in such form or document such confidential information.

     (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide
the Borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described
in Section 2.13(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or in
the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on
which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be
provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not
required under subsection (e) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to
indemnification under


                                       17
<PAGE>

Section 2.13(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by
reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject
to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document
required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall
reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.

     SECTION 2.14. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than
pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 2.13 or 8.04(c)) in excess of its ratable share
of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender
shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the
Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of
such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

     SECTION 2.15. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to
such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of
Advances. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower
(with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required
or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of
pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such
Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note
payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount up to the Commitment
of such Lender.

     (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 8.07(d) shall
include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which
accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each
Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if
appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of
any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the
Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.

     (c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to
subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to
subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal
and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to,
in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or
accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided,
however, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any
finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement.

     SECTION 2.16. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be
available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for
general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

(and each of the giving of the applicable Notice of Borrowing and the acceptance

representation and warranty by the Borrower that on the date of such Borrowing
such statements are true):

          (i) the representations and warranties contained in each Loan Document

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     SECTION 4.01. Representations and Warranties of the Borrower. The Borrower
represents and warrants as follows:

          (a) Due Organization, Authorization, etc. Each of the Borrower and
     each Material Subsidiary (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly
     existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing under the laws of
     its jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) is duly qualified to do business
     and (to the extent applicable) in good standing in each jurisdiction where,
     because of the nature of its activities or properties, such qualification
     is required except where the failure to qualify would not have a Material
     Adverse Effect, which jurisdictions are set forth with respect to the
     Borrower and each Material Subsidiary on Schedule 4.01(a) as revised from
     time to time by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(xii), (iii) has
     the requisite corporate power and authority and the right to own and
     operate its properties, to lease the property it operates under lease, and
     to conduct its business as now and proposed to be conducted, and (iv) has
     obtained all material licenses, permits, consents or approvals from or by,
     and has made all filings with, and given all notices to, all Governmental
     Authorities having jurisdiction, to the extent required for such ownership,
     operation and conduct (including, without limitation, the consummation of
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) as to each of the
     foregoing, except where the failure to do so would not have a Material
     Adverse Effect. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
     this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
     and thereby are within its corporate powers and have been duly authorized
     by all necessary corporate action (including, without limitation,
     shareholder approval, if required). Each of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries has received all other material consents and approvals (if any
     shall be required) necessary for such execution, delivery and performance,
     and such execution, delivery and performance do not and will not contravene
     or conflict with, or create a Lien or right of termination or acceleration
     under, any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation binding upon the
     Borrower or such Material Subsidiaries. This Agreement and each of the Loan
     Documents is (or when executed and delivered will be) the legal, valid, and
     binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in
     accordance with its respective terms; provided that the Borrower assumes
     for purposes of this Section 4.01(a) that this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents have been validly executed and delivered by each of the parties
     thereto other than the Borrower.

          (b) Statutory Financial Statements. All books of account of each
     Insurance Subsidiary fully and fairly disclose all of the transactions,
     properties, assets, investments, liabilities and obligations of such
     Insurance Subsidiary and all of such books of account are in the possession
     of each Insurance Subsidiary and are true, correct and complete in all
     material respects.

          (c) GAAP Financial Statements. (i) With respect to any representation
     and warranty which is deemed to be made after the date hereof by the
     Borrower, the balance sheet and statements of operations, of shareholders'
     equity and of cash flow, which as of such date shall most recently have
     been furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to each Lender for the
     purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
     contemplated hereby, shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
     consistently applied (except as disclosed therein and, in the case of
     interim financial statements, for the absence of footnote disclosures), and
     shall present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the
     corporations covered thereby as at the dates thereof for the periods then
     ended, subject, in the case of quarterly financial statements, to normal
     year-end audit adjustments.

          (ii) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.01(c)(ii), there has been no
     change in the business, assets, operations or financial condition of the
     Borrower or any Subsidiary which has had or could reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2001.

                                       21
<PAGE>

          (d) Litigation and Contingent Liabilities. (a) Except as set forth
     (including estimates of the dollar amounts involved) in Schedule 4.01(d)
     hereto and (b) except for claims which are covered by Insurance Policies,
     coverage for which has not been denied in writing, or which relate to
     Primary Policies or Reinsurance Agreements issued by the Borrower or its
     Subsidiaries or to which it is a party entered into by the Borrower or its
     Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business (referred to herein as
     "Ordinary Course Litigation"), no claim, litigation (including, without
     limitation, derivative actions), arbitration, governmental investigation or
     proceeding or inquiry is pending or threatened against the Borrower or any
     of its Subsidiaries (i) which would, if adversely determined, have a
     Material Adverse Effect or (ii) which relates to any of the transactions
     contemplated hereby, and there is no basis known to the Borrower for any of
     the foregoing. Other than any liability incident to such claims, litigation
     or proceedings, the Borrower has no material Contingent Liabilities not
     provided for or referred to in the financial statements delivered pursuant
     to Section 4.01(c)(iii).

          (e) Employee Benefit Plans. Set forth on Schedule 4.01(e) as revised
     from time to time by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(xii) is a
     list of all welfare plans and all pension plans, within the meaning of
     sections 3(1) and (2) of ERISA, respectively, which, to the knowledge of
     the Borrower, are maintained with respect to employees of the Borrower or
     its Subsidiaries. Also set forth in Schedule 4.01(e) as revised from time
     to time by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(xii) is a list of all
     Multiemployer Plans, all Welfare Plans and all Plans which the Borrower has
     adopted or expects to adopt.

          (f) Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
     Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled by an
     investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
     1940, as amended.

          (g) Regulations U and X. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
     Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities,
     in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
     carrying margin stock. None of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, any
     Affiliate of any of them or any Person acting on their behalf has taken or
     will take action to cause the execution, delivery or performance of this
     Agreement, the making or existence of the Advances or the use of proceeds
     of Advances to violate Regulations U or X of the FRB.

          (h) Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances will be used for the
     repayment of $100,000,000 of Debt owed to RenaissanceRe Holdings, Ltd. and
     for other general corporate purposes (including capital contributions to
     Subsidiaries and acquisitions permitted under Section 5.02(c)). None of
     such proceeds will be used in violation of applicable law, and none of such
     proceeds will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether
     immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any margin stock
     as defined in Regulation U of the FRB.

          (i) Insurance. The Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries are in
     substantial compliance with all material conditions contained in their
     Insurance Policies.

          (j) Ownership of Properties. On the date of any Advance, the Borrower
     and its Material Subsidiaries will have good title to all of their
     respective material properties and assets, real and personal, of any nature
     whatsoever.

          (k) Accuracy of Information. All factual written information furnished
     heretofore or contemporaneously herewith by or on behalf of the Borrower or
     any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or the Lenders for purposes of or in
     connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
     hereby, as supplemented to the date hereof, is and all other such factual
     written information hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or
     any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or the Lenders will be, true and
     accurate in every material respect on the date as of which such information
     is dated or certified and not incomplete by omitting to state any material
     fact necessary to make such information not misleading.

          (l) Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.01(l) as updated from time to time
     pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(xii) contains a complete list of the Borrower's
     Subsidiaries indicating which Subsidiaries are Material Subsidiaries.

                                       22
<PAGE>

          (m) Insurance Licenses. Schedule 4.01(m) as revised from time to time
     by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(xii) lists all of the
     jurisdictions in which any of the Insurance Subsidiaries hold licenses
     (including, without limitation, licenses or certificates of authority from
     applicable insurance departments), permits or authorizations to transact
     insurance and reinsurance business (collectively, the "Licenses"). Except
     as set forth on Schedule 4.01(m), to the best of the Borrower's knowledge,
     no such License is the subject of a proceeding for suspension or revocation
     or any similar proceedings, there is no sustainable basis for such a
     suspension or revocation, and no such suspension or revocation is
     threatened by the Department. Schedule 4.01(m) as revised from time to time
     by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(xii) indicates the line or
     lines of insurance which each such Insurance Subsidiary is permitted to be
     engaged in with respect to each License therein listed. The Insurance
     Subsidiaries do not transact any insurance business, directly or
     indirectly, in any jurisdiction other than those enumerated on Schedule
     4.01(m) as revised from time to time by the Borrower pursuant to Section
     5.01(a)(xii) hereto, where such business requires that any such Insurance
     Subsidiary obtain any license, permit, governmental approval, consent or
     other authorization.

          (n) Taxes. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all tax
     returns that are required to be filed by it, and has paid or provided
     adequate reserves for the payment of all material taxes, including, without
     limitation, all payroll taxes and federal and state withholding taxes, and
     all assessments payable by it that have become due, other than (a) those
     that are not yet delinquent or that are disclosed on Schedule 4.01(n) and
     are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
     respect to which reserves have been established, and are being maintained,
     in accordance with GAAP or (b) those which the failure to file or pay would
     not have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule
     4.01(n), on the Effective Date there is no ongoing audit or, to the

     that would subject the issuance or sale of the Advances or any other
     liability to registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

          (p) Compliance with Laws. Neither the Borrower nor any of its

     knowledge, no such violation has been alleged and each of the Borrower and
     its Subsidiaries (i) has filed in a timely manner all reports, documents
     and other materials required to be filed by it with any Governmental
     Authority, if such failure to so file could reasonably be expected to have
     a Material Adverse Effect; and the information contained in each of such
     filings is true, correct and complete in all material respects and (ii) has

                                    THE AGENT

     SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and
authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of
the Notes), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take
any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be
required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to the Loan Documents or applicable law. The Agent agrees to give to
each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.02. Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement,
except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (i) may treat the
Lender that made any Advance as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until
the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such
Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in
Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance, observance or
satisfaction of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on
the part of the Borrower or the existence at any time of any Default or to
inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower; (v)
shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the
perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to
be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

     SECTION 7.03. Citibank and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, the
Advances made by it and the Note issued to it, Citibank shall have the same
rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Citibank in its individual
capacity. Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from
and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the
Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as if Citibank were not the Agent and
without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. The Agent shall have no
duty to disclose information obtained or received by it or any of its Affiliates
relating to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries to the extent such information was
obtained or received in any capacity other than as Agent.

     SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement.

                                       32
<PAGE>

     SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to
the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective
principal amounts of the Advances then owed to each of them (or if no Advances
are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of
their Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement
(collectively, the "Indemnified Costs"), provided that no Lender shall be liable
for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting from the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share
of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by
the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. In the case of any
investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs,
this Section 7.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party.

     SECTION 7.06. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any
time with or without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent,
which successor shall be approved by the Borrower unless a Default has occurred
and is continuing. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 8.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
any Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall
in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Required Lenders, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,
however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by all the Lenders, do any of the following: (a) waive any of the

obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes or (g) amend this
Section 8.01; and provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall,

above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under any
Loan Document.

     SECTION 8.02. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications provided
for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier, telegraphic or telex

     SECTION 8.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or
the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under
any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single

thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

     SECTION 8.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay on demand

to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this
Agreement. The Borrower further agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses
of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable
counsel fees and expenses), in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent and each
Lender in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 8.04(a).

     (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and each
Lender and each of their Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees,
agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all
claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by or asserted or
awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in
connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection
with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in
connection therewith) the Notes, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any of
the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Advances, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss,
liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or
other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 8.04(b) applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its directors, equityholders or creditors
or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnified
Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated. The Borrower also agrees not to assert any
claim for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages against the
Agent, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory of
liability, arising out of or otherwise relating to the Notes, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the
actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances.

     (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate
Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on
the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment
or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.07(d), 2.09 or 2.11, acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, the
Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to
compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may
reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion, including, without
limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense
incurred

                                       34
<PAGE>

by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired
by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

     (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in
Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes.

     SECTION 8.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to
declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01,
each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and
all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement and the Note held by such Lender, whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such
obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower
after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights
of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off)
that such Lender and its Affiliates may have.

     SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective (other
than Section 2.01, which shall only become effective upon satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed
by the Borrower and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by
each Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has executed it and thereafter
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Agent and
each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest
herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

     SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may assign to
one or more Persons all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment,
the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however,
that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) except in
the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such
assignment, was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the
date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in
no event be less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof unless the Borrower and the Agent otherwise agree, (iii) each such
assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note
subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Upon
such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor
thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
(other than its rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 8.04 to the extent any
claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior such assignment) and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto).

     (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender
assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in
such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with any Loan Document or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of, or

                                       35
<PAGE>

the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported
to be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
to the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or observance by
the Borrower of any of its obligations under any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an
Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion
under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof,
together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto;
and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their
terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required to
be performed by it as a Lender.

     (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee,
together with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if
such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the
form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record
the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Borrower.

     (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from
time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent
and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as
a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities (other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any
Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the
Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of
this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant
under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or
waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by
the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or
consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or
other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation.

     (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or
proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose to
the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information
relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the
Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or
participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the
confidentiality of any Confidential Information relating to the Borrower
received by it from such Lender.

     (g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any
Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing
to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

                                       36
<PAGE>

     SECTION 8.08. Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders agrees to take and to
cause its Affiliates to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due
care to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as
"confidential" or "secret" by the Borrower and provided to it by the Borrower or
any Subsidiary, or by the Agent on the Borrower's or such Subsidiary's behalf,
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall use any such information other than in connection with or in
enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with
other business now or hereafter existing or contemplated with the Borrower or
any Subsidiary; except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such
Lender, or (ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Borrower, provided that such source is not bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Borrower known to such Lender; provided,
however, that any Lender may disclose such information (A) at the request or
pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which such Lender
is subject or in connection with an examination of such Lender by any such
authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or other court process; (C) when required to
do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law;
(D) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or
proceeding to which the Agent or any Lender or their respective Affiliates may
be party; (E) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise
of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (F) to such Lender's
independent auditors and other professional advisors; (G) to any assignee of a
Lender, actual or potential, provided that such Person agrees in writing to keep
such information confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders
hereunder; (H) to any Lender or its Affiliate, as expressly permitted under the
terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed party with such Lender or such
Affiliate; and (I) to its Affiliates which are such Lender's parent or it or its
parent's wholly owned Subsidiary or, with the prior written consent of the
Borrower which shall not be unreasonably withheld, its other Affiliates.

     SECTION 8.09. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

     SECTION 8.10. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.11. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the
United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such federal court. The Borrower hereby agrees that service of process
in any such action or proceeding brought in the any such New York State court or
in such federal court may be made upon CT Corporation System at its offices at
1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019 (the "Process Agent") and the Borrower
hereby irrevocably appoints the Process Agent its authorized agent to accept
such service of process, and agrees that the failure of the Process Agent to
give any notice of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity of
such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based
thereon. The Borrower hereby further irrevocably consents to the service of
process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any
parties hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Borrower
at its address specified pursuant to Section 8.02. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.

     (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New
York State or federal

                                       37
<PAGE>

court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

     SECTION 8.12. Judgment. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in
any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in U.S. dollars into
another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase U.S. dollars
with such other currency at Citibank's principal office in London at 11:00 A.M.
(London time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is
given.

     (b) The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any
currency (the "Primary Currency") to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the
extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency,
such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal
banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other
currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less
than such sum due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the
applicable Primary Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary
Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess.

                                       38
<PAGE>


     SECTION 8.13. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, the Advances or the actions of
the Agent or any Lender in the negotiation, administration, performance or
enforcement thereof.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date
first above written.

U.S.$_______________                               Dated:  _______________, 200_


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, DAVINCIRE HOLDINGS LTD., a corporation
organized under the laws of Bermuda (the "Borrower"), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to
the order of _________________________ (the "Lender") for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office on the Termination Date (each as defined in the Credit
Agreement referred to below) the principal sum of U.S.$[amount of the Lender's
Commitment in figures] or, if less, the aggregate principal amount of the
Advances made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement
dated as of April 19, 2002 among the Borrower, the Lender and certain other
lenders parties thereto, and Citibank, N.A. as Agent for the Lender and such
other lenders (as amended or modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement";
the terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined) outstanding on
the Termination Date.

     The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid
in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in
the Credit Agreement.

     Both principal and interest are payable in lawful money of the United
States of America to Citibank, as Agent, at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New
York 10013, in same day funds. Each Advance owing to the Lender by the Borrower
pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all payments made on account of principal
thereof, shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer hereof,
endorsed on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory Note.

     This Promissory Note is one of the Notes referred to in, and is entitled to
the benefits of, the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, among other things,
(i) provides for the making of Advances by the Lender to the Borrower from time
to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the U.S.
dollar amount first above mentioned, the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting
from each such Advance being evidenced by this Promissory Note and (ii) contains
provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain
stated events and also for prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to
the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified. The
obligations of the Borrower under this Promissory Note and the Credit Agreement
are secured by collateral as provided therein.

                                          DAVINCIRE HOLDINGS LTD.
