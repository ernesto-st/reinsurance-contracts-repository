<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">I. Background Horace Mann Educators Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) formerly maintained the Horace Mann  Educators Corporation 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#8220;2002 Incentive Plan&#8221;), the Horace Mann Educators  Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees (&#8220;Employees&#8217; Plan&#8221;), and the Horace Mann Educators  Corporation Deferred Equity Plan for Directors (&#8220;Directors&#8217; Plan&#8221;). The Company established the 2010 Comprehensive Executive Compensation Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) effective May 27, 2010  (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;) to consolidate the 2002 Incentive Plan, the Employees Deferred Compensation Plan and the  Directors Deferred Equity Plan into a single document, which was approved by Shareholders of the Company on May  27, 2010. The Company subsequently amended and restated the Plan effective May 20, 2015, and further amended the  Plan effective March 7, 2017. The Company now desires to further amend and restate the Plan effective March 3, 2021 (the &quot;Restatement Effective  Date&quot;), subject to the approval of the Shareholders of the Company with respect to shares of Stock that may be  deliverable under the Plan. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms and provisions of this Plan as amended and restated shall apply to  awards granted after the Restatement Effective Date, as well as to outstanding awards granted under the Plan prior to  the Restatement Effective Date, to outstanding awards granted prior to the Effective Date under the 2002 Incentive Plan,  and to outstanding Accounts under the Employees&#8217; Plan and the Directors&#8217; Plan.   II.   Purpose The purpose of the Plan is to aid the Company in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding employees, Non- Employee Directors, and other persons who provide substantial services to the Company or its Affiliates, to provide for  equitable and competitive compensation opportunities, including deferral opportunities, to encourage long-term service,  to recognize individual contributions and reward achievement of Company goals, and promote the creation of long-term  value for Shareholders by closely aligning the interests of Participants with those of Shareholders. The Plan authorizes  stock-based and cash-based incentives for Participants. To the extent this Plan results in a deferral of income by  employees for periods extending to the termination of employment or beyond, it is maintained primarily for the purpose  of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

In addition, in the case of any Award granted in substitution for an award of a company or  business acquired by the Company or an Affiliate, shares delivered or to be delivered in connection with such substitute  Award shall not be counted against the number of shares reserved under the Plan, but shall be available under the Plan  by virtue of the Company&#8217;s assumption of the plan or arrangement of the acquired company or business. This Section  5.02 shall apply to the number of shares reserved and available for ISOs only to the extent consistent with applicable  regulations relating to ISOs under the Code. Because shares will count against the number reserved in Section 5.01  upon delivery (or later vesting), and subject to the share counting rules under this Section 5.02, the Committee may  determine that Awards may be outstanding that relate to more shares than the aggregate remaining available under the  Plan, so long as Awards will not result in delivery and vesting of shares in excess of the number then available under the  Plan. If for any reason Awards require delivery, at the same time or as a result of the same event, of Shares in excess of  the number then available, there shall be paid out with respect to each affected Award a number of Shares bearing the  same ratio to the number of Shares to be delivered under such Award as the number of Shares available bears to the  number of Shares required under all affected Awards. In the discretion of the Committee, either the undelivered balance  of the Shares required under the affected Awards shall be forfeited or shall be delivered when the Shareholders approve  an increase in the number of Shares available, or the Fair Market Value of the undelivered Shares shall be paid to the  affected Participants in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares of Stock will not be added back (or  with respect to awards under a Preexisting Plan, will not be added) to the aggregate number of shares of Stock available  for issuance: (i) any shares of Stock that were subject to an SAR that was settled in stock (or a stock appreciation right  granted under a Preexisting Plan that was settled in stock), (ii) shares of Stock delivered to or withheld by the Company  to pay the exercise price of an Option (or an option granted under a Preexisting Plan), (iii) shares of Stock delivered to or  withheld by the Company to pay the withholding taxes related to an Option or SAR (or an option or stock appreciation  right granted under a Preexisting Plan), or (iv) shares of Stock repurchased on the open market with cash proceeds from  exercise of an Option (or option granted under a Preexisting Plan). Any shares of Stock that again become available for  grant (or with respect to awards under a Preexisting Plan, are added to the aggregate number of shares of Stock  available for issuance) pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be added back as one (1) share of Stock if such shares were  subject to Options or SARs granted under the Plan or options or stock appreciation rights granted under a Preexisting  Plan, and as two and one half (2.5) shares of Stock if such shares were subject to full-value Awards granted under the  Plan or subject to awards other than options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Preexisting Plans. 5.03 Per Person Award Limits RSUs and other Awards denominated in Shares that are granted to Non-Employee Directors (exclusive of Non-Employee  Director elective fee deferrals under Section 9.04 below) shall not exceed $150,000 in Fair Market Value (determined as  of the date of grant) for any Non-Employee Director in any calendar year. 5.04 Preexisting Plans No grants of Awards will be made under any Preexisting Plan after the Effective Date. VI.   Eligibility Awards may be granted under the Plan only to Eligible Persons. An employee on leave of absence, including for a  disability who has not had a Separation from Service may be considered as still in the employ of the Company or an  Affiliate for purposes of eligibility for participation in the Plan.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">VII.   Specific Terms of Certain Stock-Based Awards 7.01 General a. General Terms. Awards may be granted on the terms and conditions set forth in this Article VII. In addition, the  Committee may impose on any Award or the exercise thereof, at the date of grant or thereafter (subject to  Section 12.07), such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the  Committee shall determine, including terms requiring forfeiture of Awards in the event of termination of  employment or service by the Participant and terms permitting a Participant to make elections relating to his or  her Award. The Committee shall retain full power and discretion with respect to any term or condition of an  Award that is not mandatory under the Plan. The Committee shall require the payment of lawful consideration for  an Award to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and may  otherwise require payment of consideration for an Award except as limited by the Plan. b. Minimum Vesting. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.01(b), no portion of any grant of Options, Stock  Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units (including any such Award that is otherwise  intended to constitute a Performance Award) shall, on the date any such Award is granted, provide that such  Award shall become vested (i.e., nonforfeitable) or free from restriction, as applicable, sooner than the first  anniversary of the date such Award is granted; provided, that an Award may provide for earlier vesting or lapse  of restrictions (i) in the event of the death or disability of the applicable Participant, (ii) if such Award is granted  pursuant to Section 10.01 hereof and the award being replaced was previously subject to vesting or a lapse of  restrictions that would have occurred within one year of the date the substitute Award is granted, (iii) Awards  granted prior to March 7, 2017 shall not be subject to the vesting minimums described in this Section 7.01(b). In  addition to the exceptions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the Committee shall have the authority to  grant Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units (including any such Award  that is otherwise intended to constitute a Performance Award) that become vested (i.e., nonforfeitable) or free  from restrictions, as applicable, prior to the first anniversary of the grant date thereof, so long as such Awards do  not represent more than five percent (5%) of the aggregate maximum number of shares of Stock available for  Awards under this Plan (as set forth in Section 5.01). For purposes of determining the number of shares of Stock  that remain available for delivery under the five percent (5%) limit set forth in the preceding sentence, the  counting rules set forth in Section 5.02 of this Plan shall apply.    7.02 Options  The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions: a. Exercise Price. The exercise price per share of Stock purchasable under an Option (including both ISOs and  Nonstatutory Options) shall be determined by the Committee, provided that such exercise price shall be not less  than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant of such Option. b. Option Term; Time and Method of Exercise. The Committee shall determine the term of each Option, which in no  event shall exceed a period of ten years from the date of grant. The Committee shall determine the time or times  at which or the circumstances under which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on  achievement of performance goals and/or future service requirements), the methods by which such exercise  price may be paid or deemed to be paid and the form of such payment, including, without limitation, cash, Stock  (including Stock deliverable upon exercise), Restricted Stock or other property that does not have a deferral  feature, other Awards or awards granted under other plans of the Company or any Affiliate, or other property  (including through &#8220;net exercise&#8221; or &#8220;cashless exercise&#8221; arrangements, to the extent permitted by applicable  law), and the methods by or forms in which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered in satisfaction of  Options.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">c. Incentive Stock Options i. Only employees (as determined in accordance with Section 3401(c) of the Code) of the Company or any  of its subsidiaries may be granted Incentive Stock Options. For this purpose, &#8220;subsidiary&#8221; means any  company (other than the Company) in an unbroken chain beginning with the Company; provided each  company in the unbroken chain (other than the Company) owns, at the time of determination, stock  possessing 50% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock in one or the other  companies in such chain. ii. If and to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Stock (determined as of the date of grant)  with respect to which a Participant&#8217;s Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time during any  calendar year exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Options. For purposes  of applying this limitation, Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they  were granted.  iii. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, upon the Participant&#8217;s termination of employment  for any reason, any outstanding Incentive Stock Option granted to such Participant, whether vested or  unvested, to the extent not theretofore exercised, shall terminate immediately. iv. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted more than 10 years after the earlier of the adoption of the  Plan or shareholder approval of the Plan; provided that after the initial adoption of the Plan, such 10-year  period shall be measured from the earlier of a subsequent amendment of the Plan requiring shareholder  approval or shareholder approval of the Plan as so subsequently amended. v. Award Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such other terms and conditions as  may be necessary to comply with the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. 7.03 Stock Appreciation Rights The Committee is authorized to grant SARs to Eligible Persons. The Committee shall determine the term of each SAR;  provided that in no event shall the term of an SAR exceed a period of ten years from the date of grant. The Committee  shall determine at the date of grant or thereafter, the time or times at which and the circumstances under which an SAR  may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service  requirements), the method of exercise, method of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement (whether cash,  Stock, or other property), and the method by or forms in which Stock will be delivered or deemed to be delivered to  Participants, whether or not an SAR shall be free-standing or in tandem or combination with any other Award.   7.04 Restricted Stock The Committee is authorized to grant Restricted Stock to Eligible Persons on the following terms and conditions: a. Grant and Restrictions. Restricted Stock shall be subject to such restrictions on transferability, risk of forfeiture  and other restrictions, if any, as the Committee may impose, which restrictions may lapse separately or in  combination at such times, under such circumstances (including based on achievement of performance goals  and/or future service requirements), in such installments or otherwise and under such other circumstances as  the Committee may determine at the date of grant or thereafter. A Participant shall pay such consideration for  the Restricted Stock as the Committee may require; provided that the minimum consideration for shares of  Restricted Stock (other than treasury shares) shall be the par value of such shares of Stock. Except to the extent  restricted under the terms of the Plan and any Award Agreement relating to the Restricted Stock, a Participant  granted Restricted Stock shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the Restricted  Stock and the right to receive dividends thereon (subject to subsection (d) below).  b. Forfeiture. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee or provided in the Award Agreement, upon  termination of employment or service during the applicable restriction period, Restricted Stock that is at that  time subject to restrictions shall be forfeited and reacquired by the Company; provided that the Committee may  provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Agreement, or may determine in any individual case, that  restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to Restricted Stock will lapse in whole or in part, including in the  event of terminations resulting from specified causes.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">c. Evidence of Stock Ownership. Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the  Committee shall determine, including appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized  transfer agent of the Company. If certificates representing Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the  Participant, the Committee may require that such certificates bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms,  conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock, that the Company retain physical possession of  the certificates, and that the Participant deliver a stock power to the Company, endorsed in blank, relating to the  Restricted Stock. d. Dividends and Splits. As a condition to the grant of an Award of Restricted Stock, the Committee may require  that any dividends paid on a share of Restricted Stock shall be either (A) paid with respect to such Restricted  Stock at the dividend payment date in cash, in kind, or in a number of shares of unrestricted Stock having a Fair  Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends, or (B) automatically reinvested in additional Restricted  Stock or held in kind, which shall be subject to the same terms as applied to the original Restricted Stock to  which it relates, or (C) deferred as to payment, either as a cash deferral or with the amount or value thereof  automatically deemed reinvested in additional Restricted Stock, other Awards or other investment vehicles,  subject to such terms as the Committee shall determine or permit a Participant to elect. Unless otherwise  determined by the Committee, cash, Stock or other property distributed in connection with a Stock split or Stock  dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend, shall be subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to  the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Stock or other property has been  distributed.   7.05 Restricted Stock Units The Committee is authorized to grant RSUs to Eligible Persons, subject to the following terms and conditions except as  provided in subsection (e) below:    a. Award and Restrictions. RSUs shall be subject to restrictions constituting a substantial risk of forfeiture, which  conditions may be time-based or performance-based. Unless deferred pursuant to subsection 7.05(d) below,  settlement of RSUs by delivery of cash, Stock, or other property, as specified in the Award Agreement, shall  occur upon the lapse of the substantial risk of forfeiture, but no later than March 15 of the year following the year  in which the substantial risk of forfeiture lapses. In addition, RSUs shall be subject to such restrictions on  transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the Committee may impose, which restrictions may lapse at the  same time as the substantial risk of forfeiture or at earlier or later specified times, separately or in combination, in  installments or otherwise, and under such other circumstances as the Committee may determine at the date of  grant or thereafter.  b. Forfeiture. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon termination of employment or service during  the applicable deferral period or portion thereof to which forfeiture conditions apply (as provided in the Award  Agreement evidencing the RSUs), all RSUs that are at that time subject to such forfeiture conditions shall be  forfeited, together with any Dividend Equivalents that have accrued thereon; unless the Committee provides, by  rule or regulation or in any Award Agreement, or may determine in any individual case, that restrictions or  forfeiture conditions relating to RSUs will lapse in whole or in part, including in the event of terminations of  employment or service resulting from specified causes.  c. Dividend Equivalents. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Dividend Equivalents on RSUs shall be  either (A) paid with respect to such RSUs at the dividend payment date in cash or in shares of unrestricted Stock  having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends, or (B) deferred with respect to such RSUs,  either as a cash deferral or with the amount or value thereof automatically deemed reinvested in RSUs, other  Awards or other investment vehicles having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends, as the  Committee shall determine or permit a Participant to elect, and shall be paid when the RSUs to which they relate  are settled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dividend Equivalents (whether in the form of RSUs or otherwise) on  RSUs that are Performance Awards shall be forfeited if the RSUs to which they relate are forfeited or otherwise  not earned. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, cash, Stock or other property distributed in  connection with a Stock split or Stock dividend, and other property distributed as a dividend, shall be subject to  restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such Stock  or other property has been distributed.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">d. Deferral of RSUs. The Committee may permit an employee or Non-Employee Director who is granted RSUs to  elect to defer settlement of the RSUs in accordance with this Section 7.05(d), subject to such additional terms  and conditions as the Committee shall designate in its discretion. i. Deferral Elections. An election to defer RSUs shall be made on or before December 31 of the calendar  year preceding the calendar year in which the RSUs are granted, on a form (which may be electronic)  authorized by the Committee, and shall not carry over from year to year unless the Committee timely  provides otherwise. The RSU deferral election shall include (x) the portion of the RSU Award to be  deferred, (y) the date on which settlement of the deferred RSUs shall be made or commence (which may  be a fixed date, the grantee&#8217;s attainment of a particular age, the grantee&#8217;s Separation from Service for  any reason, or such other dates or circumstances as may be required or permitted by the Committee);  and (z) whether settlement shall be made on a single date or in installments over a period and subject to  such terms and conditions as may be set by the Committee at the time of the deferral election. If there is  no election as to form of settlement, then settlement shall be made no later than 90 days following the  date designated in (y), in a lump sum in cash, Stock, or such other medium as the Committee may  designate. ii. New Grantees. Notwithstanding subsection (i) above, the Committee may permit an RSU deferral  election to be made by a grantee who never previously received an RSU, and who never previously had  an Account and never previously had deferred compensation under any other plan required by Code  Section 409A to be aggregated with his or her RSUs. Such an individual&#8217;s RSU deferral election shall be  made within 30 days of the grant of the RSUs and shall be effective only with respect to a fractional  portion of the RSUs determined by multiplying (separately with respect to each applicable vesting date),  the grant date value of the number of RSUs vesting on such vesting date by a fraction, the numerator of  which is the number of calendar days between the date the deferral election is received by the Company  and the date such RSUs vest, and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days  between the grant date and the vesting date.  iii. Dividend Equivalents on Deferred RSUs. During the deferral period, Dividend Equivalents shall be  credited to deferred RSUs pursuant to subsection (c) subject to such terms and conditions as the  Committee shall specify. iv. Claims Procedure. To the extent RSUs are deferred to the termination of covered employment or  beyond, they shall be subject to the claims procedure under Section 9.12, substituting &#8220;grantee&#8221; for  &#8220;Deferred Cash Participant&#8221; and &#8220;settlement of deferred RSUs&#8221; for &#8220;distribution from an Account&#8221;. e. Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (d) above, those subsections shall not apply to fully vested RSUs  credited to an Account pursuant to the Deferred Cash Sub-Plan, which shall be subject to the terms and  conditions set forth in Article IX.  7.06 Bonus Stock and Awards in Lieu of Obligations The Committee is authorized to grant Stock as a bonus, or to grant Stock or other Awards in lieu of obligations of the  Company or an Affiliate to pay cash or deliver other property under the Plan or under other plans or compensatory  arrangements, subject to such terms as shall be determined by the Committee. 7.07 Dividend Equivalents The Committee is authorized to grant Dividend Equivalents to a Participant, entitling the Participant to receive cash,  Stock, other Awards, or other property equivalent to all or a portion of the dividends paid with respect to a specified  number of shares of Stock. Dividend Equivalents may be awarded on a freestanding basis or in connection with another  Award. The Committee may provide that Dividend Equivalents shall be paid or distributed when accrued or shall be  deemed to have been reinvested in additional Stock, Awards, or other investment vehicles, and subject to restrictions on  transferability, risks of forfeiture and such other terms as the Committee may specify with due regard to the applicability  of Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Dividend Equivalents shall not be provided with respect to  Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, and (b) any Dividend Equivalents associated with a Performance Award shall be  forfeited to the extent the Performance Award is forfeited or otherwise not earned.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">7.08 Other Awards The Committee is authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to Eligible Persons other Awards that  may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, Stock  or factors that may influence the value of Stock, including, without limitation, convertible or exchangeable debt  securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into Stock, purchase rights for Stock, Awards with value and  payment contingent upon performance of the Company or business units thereof or any other factors designated by the  Committee, and Awards valued by reference to the book value of Stock or the value of securities of or the performance  of specified subsidiaries or affiliates or other business units. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of  such Awards, which may include the right to elective deferral thereof, subject to such terms and conditions as the  Committee may specify in its discretion. Stock delivered pursuant to an Award in the nature of a purchase right granted  under this Section 7.08 shall be purchased for such consideration, paid for at such times, by such methods, and in such  forms, including, without limitation, cash, Stock, other Awards, or other property, as the Committee shall determine.  Cash awards, as an element of or supplement to any other Award under the Plan, may also be granted pursuant to this  Section 7.08. VII.   Performance Awards, Including Annual Incentive Awards 8.01 Performance Awards Generally The Committee is authorized to grant Performance Awards to Eligible Persons, denominated in cash or in Stock or other  property, in accordance with this Article VIII. Performance Awards may be denominated as a cash amount, number of  shares of Stock, or specified number of other Awards or property (or a combination) which may be earned upon  achievement or satisfaction of performance conditions specified by the Committee over a performance period  established by the Committee. If the performance period is one year, then the Performance Award shall be deemed an  Annual Incentive Award. In addition, the Committee may specify that any other Award shall constitute a Performance  Award by conditioning the right of a Participant to exercise the Award or have it settled, and the timing thereof, upon  achievement or satisfaction of such performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may  use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any  performance conditions, including but not limited to those measures set forth in Section 8.02 below. After the end of  each performance period, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, of the Performance Award for that  performance period payable to each Participant. The Committee may, in its discretion, determine that the amount  payable to any Participant as a final Performance Award shall be reduced from the amount of his or her potential  Performance Award, including a determination to make no final Award whatsoever, and may exercise its discretion to  increase the amounts payable under any Performance Award. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which  such Performance Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of employment or service by the  Participant or other event (including a Change in Control) prior to the end of a performance period or otherwise prior to  settlement of such Performance Awards. Settlement of Performance Awards shall be in cash, Stock, other Awards or  other property, at the discretion of the Committee.  8.02 Performance Award Measures a. Performance Goals Generally. The performance goal for Performance Awards may consist of one or more of the  business criteria listed in Section 8.02(b)(i), including or excluding the adjustments described in Section  8.02(b)(ii), and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the  Committee. The Performance Award may also have threshold levels of performance (below which no  Performance Award shall be paid) and maximum levels of Performance Award, regardless of the degree to which  the actual performance exceeds the target level. The performance goal may be objective. Any performance goal  may be established for one performance period or averaged over time, as the Committee may deem  appropriate. Performance may, but need not be, based on a change or an increase or positive result.  Performance goals may differ for Performance Awards granted to any one Participant or to different Participants.  The targeted level or levels of performance with respect to such business criteria may be established at such  levels and in such terms as the Committee may determine, in its discretion, including in absolute terms, as a  goal relative to performance in prior periods, or as a goal compared to the performance of one or more  comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies, or any combination thereof.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">b. Business Criteria; Inclusion and Exclusion of Certain Items. i. Performance goals may be based on one or more of the following business criteria for the Company, on  a consolidated basis, pre-tax or after-tax, and/or for specified subsidiaries or affiliates, other business  units, or lines of business, or for any individual: (1) insurance premiums written, insurance premiums  earned, contract deposits, contract charges earned, or policies or contracts in force; (2) increase in  gross revenues; (3) income before realized investment gains and losses (operating income), before or  after taxes, and income before or after interest, depreciation, amortization, or extraordinary, or unusual  or infrequently occurring or special items; (4) income before realized investment gains and losses  (operating income) per common share (basic or diluted), and income before realized investment gains  and losses (operating income) from continuing operations per common share (basic or diluted); (5) return  on equity (including operating income return on average equity), return on assets (gross or net), return on  investment, or return on capital; (6) market capitalization; (7) cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow return  on investment (discounted or otherwise), net cash provided by operations, or cash flow in excess of cost  of capital; (8) book value of Stock, including or excluding the effect of unrealized investment gains and  losses (FAS 115 or any successor thereto); (9) net interest margin; (10) annuity accumulated value or  annuity accumulated value persistency; (11) net investment income and realized investment gains or  losses (including on a per share basis); (12) economic value created; (13) operating margin or profit  margin; (14) expense ratios, claims ratios, or loss ratios; (15) stock price or TSR; (16) shareholder equity  or changes in shareholder equity; (17) dividends, including as a percentage of net income; (18) strategic  business criteria, consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified market penetration or  geographic business expansion goals, cost targets, market share, premium levels, surplus levels,  customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, management of employment practices and employee  benefits, sales units, agent growth and goals relating to acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures; (19)  satisfaction of hiring goals; (20) financial or credit ratings; (21) results of objective customer satisfaction  surveys; (22) satisfaction of diversity goals; (23) enterprise risk management; or (24) succession planning.  ii. The Committee may provide in any Performance Award that any evaluation of performance may include  or exclude any of the following items:  (1) unusually large catastrophe losses which aggregate (net of  reinsurance) in excess of &#8220;planned&#8221; catastrophe losses; (2) asset write-downs; (3) litigation or claim  judgments or settlements; (4) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles, regulations, or  other laws or regulations affecting reported results; (5) any reorganization and restructuring programs; (6)  acquisitions or divestitures;  (7) extraordinary, or unusual or infrequently occurring items identified in the  Company&#8217;s audited financial statements, including footnotes, (8) annual incentive payments, other  bonuses or benefit plan charges; or (9) capital charges. c. Performance Award Pool. The Committee may establish a Performance Award pool, which shall be an unfunded  pool, for purposes of measuring performance in connection with Performance Awards. The amount of such  Performance Award pool may be based upon the achievement of one or more performance goals based on one  or more of the business criteria set forth in Section 8.02(b) during the performance period, as specified by the  Committee. The Committee may specify the amount of the Performance Award pool as a percentage of any of  such business criteria, a percentage thereof in excess of a threshold amount, or as another amount which need  not bear a strictly mathematical relationship to such business criteria. The maximum amount payable to any  Participant shall be a stated percentage of the bonus pool; provided the sum of such percentages shall not  exceed 100%. IX.   Deferred Cash Sub-Plan 9.01 Deferred Cash Sub-Plan This Article IX providing for deferrals of certain amounts otherwise payable in cash shall constitute the Deferred Cash  Sub-Plan (&#8220;Sub Plan&#8221;) within the Plan. To the extent the Sub-Plan results in deferral of income by employees to the  termination of covered employment or beyond, the Sub-Plan is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing  deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Except as otherwise  provided, the terms and conditions of this Sub-Plan apply solely to the Sub-Plan. Horace Mann Educators Corporation      17  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">9.03 Sub-Plan Administration a. The Sub-Plan shall be administered by the Administrator. The action of a majority of the committee shall be  deemed to be the action of the Administrator; provided that no member of the committee shall vote on any  discretionary action with respect to such member&#8217;s own Deferred Stock Equivalent Account or status or action  as a Deferred Cash Participant. In addition to the powers and subject to the limitations  contained elsewhere in  the Plan and the Sub-Plan, the Administrator shall have the sole and complete authority: (a) to impose such  limitations,  restrictions and conditions as the Administrator shall deem appropriate, (b) to interpret the Sub-Plan  and to adopt, amend and rescind administrative guidelines, forms, and other rules and regulations relating to the  Sub-Plan, (c) to correct defects in the Sub-Plan, supply omissions and correct administrative errors, and (d) to  make all other determinations and to take all other actions necessary or advisable for the implementation and  administration of the Sub-Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator shall have no authority,  discretion or power to alter or amend any terms or conditions specified in the Sub-Plan. The Administrator&#8217;s  determinations on matters within the Administrator&#8217;s authority shall be conclusive and binding upon the  Company, the Deferred Cash Participants, Beneficiaries and all other persons. 9.04 Deferral Elections a. LTIP Employees. An LTIP Employee may elect to defer receipt of all or a specified portion of any Long-Term  Bonus Compensation otherwise payable in cash.  b. Non-Employee Directors. A Non-Employee Director may elect to defer receipt of all or a specified portion of the  Non-Employee Director&#8217;s cash annual retainer, cash annual committee chair&#8217;s fee, cash annual Chairman of the  Board&#8217;s fee, cash Board meeting fees, cash Committee meeting fees, or other Director compensation otherwise  payable in cash. c. Deferral Election. Deferral elections must be timely filed with the Company on forms (which may be electronic)  approved by the Administrator. An LTIP Employee&#8217;s election shall include: the percentage or dollar amount of  each applicable Long-Term Bonus Compensation payment to be deferred. A Non-Employee Director&#8217;s election  shall include the percentage or dollar amount of cash fees to be deferred (which may be designated separately  with respect to each type of cash fees). Each Deferred Cash Participant shall designate (i) the Distribution Date  for such deferred payments and (ii) the form of distribution thereof. 9.05 Timing of Deferral Elections a. Initial Elections. An election to defer Long-Term Bonus Compensation payments shall be made on or before  December 31 of the calendar year preceding the first calendar year in the performance period during which the  Long-Term Bonus Compensation is earned. An election to defer cash Non-Employee Directors fees must be  filed no later than December 31 preceding the calendar year in which the fees to be deferred are to be earned.  Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, deferral elections do not carry over from year to year. A new  deferral election must be made with respect to amounts earned in each calendar year (or where longer than one  year, each performance period). b. New LTIP Employees. Notwithstanding Section 9.05(a), with respect to an individual who first becomes an LTIP  Employee during a calendar year, the LTIP Employee&#8217;s election must be made and filed within thirty (30) days of  the date such individual first becomes an LTIP Employee; provided, however, that if the LTIP Employee has or  ever had a Deferred Stock Equivalent Account under the Plan or has or ever had deferred compensation any  other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with his or her Deferred Stock Equivalent Account,  the preceding portion of this sentence shall not apply and the LTIP Employee may not make a deferral election  with respect to Long-Term Bonus Compensation until the next calendar year, unless:  i. he or she was not eligible to make a deferral election under this Sub-Plan (or under any other plan  required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with this Sub-Plan) at any time during the twenty-four  (24)-month period ending on the date he or she again becomes an LTIP Employee, or  ii. he or she was paid all nonqualified deferred compensation amounts previously due under the Sub-Plan  (or under any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with this Sub-Plan) and, on  and before the date of the last such payment, was not eligible to continue to participate in this Sub-Plan  (and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with this Sub-Plan) for periods  after such payment.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">A deferral election under this Section 9.05(b) will be effective only with respect to Long-Term Bonus  Compensation paid for services performed after such election. For this purpose, the amount of the bonus  payable to the LTIP Employee for services rendered subsequent to the LTIP Employee&#8217;s election will be  determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days  remaining in the performance period after the election and the denominator of which is the total number of  calendar days in such performance period. For this purpose, the date the executed election form (which may be  electronic) is received by the Company.  c. New Non-Employee Directors. Notwithstanding Section 9.05(a), with respect to the calendar year in which an  individual first becomes a Non-Employee Director (either by election or appointment), the Non-Employee  Director&#8217;s election must be made and filed: i. with respect to the annual Director&#8217;s fee, the annual committee chair&#8217;s fee, the annual Chairman of the  Board&#8217;s fee, or other fees paid on an annual basis, prior to the date the individual becomes a Director;  and ii. with respect to the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s meeting fees, within thirty (30) days after the date the  individual becomes a Non-Employee Director (either by election or appointment), but only with respect  to fees for meetings which occur after the date of such deferral election.  An individual who was a Non-Employee Director, ceased being a Director, and again becomes a Non-Employee  Director (either by election or appointment), shall be considered a new Non-Employee Director only if: iii. he or she was not eligible to make deferral elections under this Sub-Plan (or any other plan or  arrangement required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with this Sub-Plan) at any time during the  twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the date he or she again becomes a Non-Employee Director, or  iv. he or she was paid all nonqualified deferred compensation amounts previously due under the Sub-Plan  (or under any other plan or arrangement required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Sub- Plan) and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was not eligible to continue to participate in  the Sub-Plan (or any other plan or arrangement required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with  the Sub-Plan) for periods after such payment.  9.06 Accounts a. Deferred Stock Equivalent Accounts. A Deferred Stock Equivalent Account and related Subaccounts shall be  established for each Deferred Cash Participant. Amounts deferred by a Deferred Cash Participant  shall be  converted into fully vested RSUs as of the applicable Payment Date in a number determined by dividing the  amount deferred (net of any applicable withholding) by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the  applicable Payment Date (rounded to two decimal places), and shall be credited to the Deferred Stock  Equivalent Account as of such date. The Deferred Stock Equivalent Account shall be credited with Dividend  Equivalents as provided in Section 9.06(b) and shall be reduced by the amount of any distributions as of the date  of distribution.  b. Dividend Equivalents. A Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Deferred Stock Equivalent Account shall be credited with  Dividend Equivalents on the dividend distribution date with respect to each fully vested RSU credited to such  Account on the applicable record date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Dividend Equivalents shall be credited  to the Account of a Non-Employee Director Participant whose Separation from Service occurs prior to the  applicable record date. c. Fractional Shares. Fractional shares shall be credited to a Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Deferred Stock Equivalent  Account cumulatively, but distribution of the Deferred Stock Equivalent Account shall be made in accordance  with Section 9.08.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">9.07 Distributions a. Timing of Payment. Each Subaccount in a Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Deferred Stock Equivalent Account shall  be distributed or shall commence to be distributed promptly upon and in no event more than ninety (90) days  following the Distribution Date; provided that if the applicable Distribution Date is the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s  Separation from Service and as of the date of such Separation from Service the Deferred Cash Participant is a  Specified Employee, the Subaccount shall be distributed or shall commence to be distributed on the Delayed  Distribution Date. If the Deferred Cash Participant did not make an affirmative election as to the Distribution Date  of any Subaccount, he or she shall be deemed to have elected the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Separation from  Service as the Distribution Date.  b. Form of Payment. Each Subaccount in a Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Deferred Stock Equivalent Account shall be  distributed in the form selected by the Deferred Cash Participant within the time period for making an initial  deferral election with respect to such Subaccount, which shall be one of the following, subject to the remaining  provisions of this Article IX.  i. a single lump sum; or  ii. installments over a period designated by the Deferred Cash Participant (not to exceed five (5) years).  Except as otherwise provided in the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s deferral form, the first such installment  shall be based on the number of fully vested RSUs credited to the Account on the first Distribution Date,  divided by the number of installments. Subsequent installment payments shall be based on the same  number of RSUs as the first installment (subject to adjustments as provided in Section 12.05), plus  Dividend Equivalents accumulated on such number of RSUs since payment of the prior installment. The  last installment shall include all amounts not previously distributed. For purposes of this Sub-Plan and  Code Section 409A, the entitlement to installment payments is treated as the entitlement to a single  payment.  If the Deferred Cash Participant does not make an affirmative election as to the form of election of any  Subaccount, he or she shall be deemed to have elected distribution of such Subaccount in a lump sum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for avoidance of doubt, Accounts are subject to the provisions of Article XI  (regarding Change in Control). 9.08 Medium of Payment a. Deferred Cash Participant Election. Distributions from a Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Deferred Stock Equivalent  Account shall be made in shares of Stock (one share of Stock for each RSU subject to such distribution), or in  cash in an amount equal to the number of RSUs subject to such distribution multiplied by the Fair Market Value  of a share of Stock, as of the date of the distribution, as the Deferred Cash Participant may choose at such time  and in such manner as may be permitted by the Administrator. b. Cash is Default Election. If the Deferred Cash Participant does not make an affirmative election as to the medium  of payment, the Deferred Cash Participant shall be deemed to have elected a distribution in cash. 9.09 No Subsequent Elections as to Time and Form of Distribution a. Pre-2009 Subaccounts. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Distribution Date and form of  payment with respect to any Subaccount in existence as of January 1, 2009 shall be in accordance with the last  election made or deemed made by the Deferred Cash Participant on or before December 31, 2008 with respect  to such Subaccount.  b. No Subsequent Deferral Elections. After December 31, 2008, no Deferred Cash Participant may change his or  her Distribution Date or form of payment with respect to any Subaccount at any time after he or she makes the  initial election.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">9.10 Payment Upon the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Death In the event a Deferred Cash Participant dies before his or her entire Deferred Stock Equivalent Account is distributed, all  undistributed amounts remaining in such Account shall be distributed to the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Beneficiary  promptly and in no event more than ninety (90) days after the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s death in a lump sum cash  payment or other manner permitted by the Administrator.  9.11 Unforeseeable Emergencies a. Application for Distribution. In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, to the extent the Administrator  determines that such action is necessary to alleviate the Unforeseeable Emergency, the Administrator may pay  all or a part of a Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s Account to the Deferred Cash Participant in cash, plus amounts  necessary to pay federal, state or local income taxes and penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the  distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such need is or may be relieved through  reimbursement or compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s assets (to the  extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by cessation of  deferrals under the Sub-Plan or another plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Sub- Plan. Such action shall be taken only if the Deferred Cash Participant (or the Deferred Cash Participant&#8217;s legal  representative or successor) submits a signed application describing fully the circumstances which are deemed  to justify the payment, together with an estimate of the amounts necessary to alleviate the Unforeseeable  Emergency (together with taxes on the distribution), which application shall be approved or denied by the  Administrator after making such inquiries as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate.  b. Application for Cessation of Deferrals. In the event a Deferred Cash Participant requests a distribution due to an  Unforeseeable Emergency, or the Deferred Cash Participant requests a cancellation of deferrals under the Plan  in order to alleviate his or her Unforeseeable Emergency, and the Administrator determines that the Deferred  Cash Participant&#8217;s Unforeseeable Emergency may be relieved through the cessation of some or all the Deferred  Cash Participant&#8217;s deferral elections under the Plan for such calendar year, the Administrator shall permit  cancellation of such deferral elections as appropriate to alleviate the Unforeseeable Emergency, shall be  cancelled as soon as administratively practicable following such determination by the Administrator. 9.12 Claims Procedures Any Deferred Cash Participant or Beneficiary of a Deferred Cash Participant (&#8220;Applicant&#8221;) who believes he or she is  entitled to a distribution from an Account or who desires to clarify his or her rights under this Sub-Plan may file a written  claim for benefits with the Administrator. If a claim for benefits is denied, the Administrator shall furnish to the Applicant  within 90 days after its receipt of such claim (or within 180 days after such receipt if special circumstances require an  extension of time), a written notice which: (a) specifies the reasons for the denial, (b) refers to the pertinent provisions of  the Sub-Plan on which the denial is based, (c) describes any additional material or information necessary for the  perfection of the claim and explains why such material or information is necessary, and (d) explains the claim review  procedures. Upon the written request of the Applicant submitted within 60 days after receipt of such written notice, the  Administrator shall afford the Applicant a full and fair review of the decision denying the claim and, if so requested: (1)  permit the Applicant to review any documents which are pertinent to the claim, (2) permit the Applicant to submit to the  Administrator issues and comments in writing and (3) afford the Applicant an opportunity to meet with the Administrator  as a part of the review procedure. Within 60 days after the Administrator&#8217;s receipt of a request for review (or within 120  days after such receipt if special circumstances, such as the need to hold a meeting, require an extension of time) the  Administrator shall notify the Applicant in writing of the Administrator&#8217;s decision on appeal and the reasons for such  decision, and shall refer the Applicant to the provisions of the Plan which form the basis for such decision. 9.13 Deferred Compensation Plan The Sub-Plan is a non-qualified plan of deferred compensation and Accounts represent 409A Compensation. No  benefits under the Sub-Plan shall be subject to &#8220;grandfathering&#8221; treatment under Code Section 409A, even if such  benefits were deferred and vested under the Employees&#8217; Plan or the Directors&#8217; Plan before January 1, 2005. The  Company intends that amounts deferred under the Sub-Plan shall either be exempt from or comply with the restrictions  of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan (including the Sub-Plan) shall be administered, interpreted and construed at  all times consistent with that intent.

The last such designation received by the Committee prior to the Participant&#8217;s death  shall be controlling. If no such Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of the Participant&#8217;s death, or if no  designated Beneficiary survives the Participant, the Participant&#8217;s estate shall be deemed to have been designated his or  her Beneficiary and the executor or administrator thereof shall receive the amount, if any, payable hereunder or exercise  or receive settlement of an Award after the Participant&#8217;s death. If the Committee is in doubt as to the right of any person  as Beneficiary, the Company may retain any amount in question until the rights thereto are determined, or the Company  may pay such amount into any court of appropriate jurisdiction and such payment shall be a complete discharge of the  liability of the Company therefor.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">12.05 Adjustments In the event that any large, special and non-recurring dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash or  property other than Stock), recapitalization, forward or reverse split, Stock dividend, reorganization, merger,  consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate  transaction or event affects the Stock such that an adjustment is appropriate, or, in the case of any outstanding Award,  necessary, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the Participant, then the Committee shall, in an  equitable manner as determined by the Committee, adjust any or all of (i) the aggregate number and kind of shares of  Stock which may be delivered in connection with Awards granted or Accounts established under the Plan, (ii) the number  and kind of shares of Stock by which annual per person Award limitations are measured under Section 5.03, (iii) the  number and kind of shares of Stock subject to or deliverable in respect of outstanding Awards or Accounts, (iv) the  exercise price, grant price or purchase price relating to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, the Committee may make  provision for a payment of cash or property to the holder of an outstanding Option, and (v) in the terms of RSUs under  the Plan. 12.06 Tax Provisions a. Withholding. The Company and any Affiliate is authorized to withhold, at the time of grant or settlement or other  time as appropriate, from any Award or Account, any payment relating to an Award or Account, including from a  distribution of Stock, or any payroll or other payment to a Participant, amounts of withholding and other taxes  required to be withheld by the Company or Affiliate. This authority shall include authority to withhold or receive  Stock or other property and to make cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of the Company&#8217;s (or an  Affiliate&#8217;s) withholding obligations, either on a mandatory or elective basis in the discretion of the Committee.  The Committee is specifically authorized to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax amounts by electing to  have the Company (or an Affiliate) withhold from the shares of Stock to be delivered upon exercise of an Option  or vesting or settlement of a Stock Award or Account that number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value  equal to the amount required to be withheld. b. Required Consent to and Notification of Code Section 83(b) Election. No election under Code Section 83(b) (to  include in gross income in the year of transfer the amounts specified in Code Section 83(b)) or under a similar  provision of the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States may be made unless expressly permitted by the  terms of the Award Agreement or by action of the Committee in writing prior to the making of such election. In  any case in which a Participant is permitted to make such an election in connection with an Award, the  Participant shall notify the Committee of such election within ten days of filing notice of the election with the  Internal Revenue Service or other governmental authority, in addition to any filing and notification required  pursuant to regulations issued under Code Section 83(b) or other applicable provision. c. Requirement of Notification Upon Disqualifying Disposition Under Code Section 421(b). If any Participant shall  make any disposition of shares of Stock delivered pursuant to the exercise of an ISO under the circumstances  described in Code Section 421(b) (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions), such Participant shall notify the  Committee of such disposition within ten days thereof.  d. Payment of Tax Amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the Internal Revenue  Service should finally determine that part or all of the value of a Participant&#8217;s Account which has not actually  been distributed or an Award that has not been settled is nevertheless required to be included in the  Participant&#8217;s or Beneficiary&#8217;s gross income for federal income tax purposes, then an amount necessary to pay  applicable federal, state or local income taxes on such includible value shall be distributed from the Account or  with respect to the Award in a lump sum cash payment within sixty (60) days after such determination, without  the requirement of separate approval by the Committee. A &#8220;final determination&#8221; of the Internal Revenue Service  is a determination in writing ordering the payment of additional tax, reporting of additional gross income or  otherwise requiring an Account or portion thereof to be included in gross income, which is not appealable or  which the Participant  or Beneficiary does not appeal within the time prescribed for appeals. For avoidance of  doubt, this Section 12.06(d) applies to all Awards and Accounts both 409A Compensation and non-409A  Compensation. 12.07 Amendment and Termination of the Plan The Company, acting through its Board on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, may at any time  terminate, and from time to time may amend or modify the Plan; provided, however, that no amendment or modification  Horace Mann Educators Corporation      26  </FONT></DIV>

In no event may any amendment or termination of the Plan accelerate the date of payment or  distribution of 409A Compensation, except as may be permitted under Code Section 409A. 12.08 No Repricing Without the approval of Shareholders, the Committee will not amend or replace previously granted Options in a  transaction that constitutes a &#8220;repricing,&#8221; as such term is used in Section 303A.08 of the Listed Company Manual of the  New York Stock Exchange, including but not limited to by means of cashing out options that whose exercise price is  above the current Fair Market Value of a share of Stock. 12.09 Clawback; Right of Setoff Awards and Accounts are subject to the Company&#8217;s policy on recoveries and such other terms and conditions as the  Committee may impose in the event the Committee determines a participant&#8217;s own misconduct contributed materially to  his or her receipt of unearned amounts of cash, Stock or other property. The Company or any Affiliate may, to the extent  permitted by applicable law, deduct from and set off against any amounts the Company or an Affiliate may owe to the  Participant from time to time, including amounts payable in connection with any Award, owed as wages, fringe benefits,  or other compensation owed to the Participant, such amounts as may be owed by the Participant to the Company,  although the Participant shall remain liable for any part of the Participant&#8217;s payment obligation not satisfied through such  deduction and setoff. By accepting any Award granted hereunder, the Participant agrees to any deduction or setoff  under this Section 12.09. Any such setoff shall be subject to Section 12.12. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no setoff  form 409A Compensation may be made if it results in acceleration or deferral of the permitted payment date under Code  Section 409A. 12.10 Nonexclusivity of the Plan Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board nor its submission to the Shareholders of the Company for approval shall  be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or a committee thereof to adopt such other incentive  arrangements, apart from the Plan, as it may deem desirable, including incentive arrangements, and such other  arrangements may be either applicable generally or only in specific cases. 12.11 Successors All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any  successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase,  merger, consolidation, or otherwise of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 12.12 Nature of Payments Unless otherwise specified in the Award Agreement, Awards shall be special incentive payments to the Participant and  shall not be taken into account in computing the amount of salary or compensation of the Participant for purposes of  determining any pension, retirement, death or other benefit under (a) any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, bonus,  insurance or other employee benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan shall otherwise expressly  provide, or (b) any agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, except as such agreement shall  otherwise expressly provide. 12.13 Electronic Media Under procedures authorized or approved by the Committee, any form for any notice, election, designation, or similar  communication required or permitted to be given to or received from a Participant under this Plan may be given or  received in an electronic medium (including computer network, e-mail or voice response system) and any such  communication to or from a Participant through such electronic media shall be fully effective under this Plan for such  purposes as such procedures shall prescribe. Any record of such communication retrieved from such electronic medium  under its normal storage and retrieval parameters shall be effective as a fully authentic executed writing for all purposes  of this Plan absent manifest error in the storage or retrieval process.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">12.14 Payments in the Event of Forfeitures; Fractional Shares Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of a forfeiture of an Award with respect to which a  Participant paid cash consideration, the Participant shall be repaid the amount of such cash consideration, or if less, the  Fair Market Value on the date of forfeiture of the shares of Stock for which the Participant paid. Distributions in Stock  shall be made in whole shares only, with the value of any fractional share distributed in cash.  12.15 Code Section 409A Considerations a. Construction in Compliance with Code Section 409A. The Company intends that none of the grant, exercise,  settlement or amendment or termination of any Award under the Plan will cause the Participant to be liable for  payment of interest or a tax penalty under Code Section 409A. The provisions of the Plan and any Award  Agreement shall be construed consistent with that intent. b. Six-Month Delay. Any distribution or settlement of 409A Compensation triggered by the Separation from Service  of a Specified Employee that would otherwise be made prior to the Deferred Distribution Date (as defined below)  shall not occur earlier than the Deferred Distribution Date. The &#8220;Deferred Distribution Date&#8221; is the day that is six  (6) month and one (1) day after a Participant&#8217;s Separation from Service. c. Certain Grandfathered Awards. Awards that are &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; under Code Section 409A and that, but for such  grandfathered status, would be deemed to be subject to Code Section 409A shall be subject to the terms and  conditions of the 2002 Incentive Plan as amended and restated at May 26, 2005 other than Sections 6(b)(ii) and  6(c)(ii) thereof, provided that if any provision adopted by amendment to the 2002 Incentive Plan or an Award  Agreement after October 3, 2004, would constitute a material modification of such grandfathered Award, such  provision will not be effective as to such Award unless so stated by the Committee in writing with specific  reference to revoking such grandfathered status. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Accounts shall be  &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; under Code Section 409A. 12.16 Governing Law The Plan and all agreements and forms hereunder shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of  the State of Delaware without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable provisions of federal law.  12.17 Awards to Participants Outside the United States The Committee may adopt rules and procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to  accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures for a Participant or group of participants who are  then resident or primarily employed outside of the United States. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the  Committee is specifically authorized (A) to adopt the rules and procedures regarding the conversion of local currency,  withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates which vary with local requirements and (B) to adopt sub-plans  in addition to the Sub-Plan, and Plan addenda as the Committee deems desirable, to accommodate foreign laws,  regulations and practice; and (C) to modify the terms of any Award under the Plan in any manner deemed by the  Committee to be necessary or appropriate in order that such Award shall conform to laws, regulations, and customs of  the country in which the Participant is then resident or primarily employed, or so that the value and other benefits of the  Award to the Participant, as affected by foreign tax laws and other restrictions applicable as a result of the Participant&#8217;s  residence or employment abroad shall be comparable to the value of such an Award to a Participant who is resident or  primarily employed in the United States.  12.18 Limitation on Rights Conferred under Plan Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as (i) giving any Eligible Person or Participant the  right to continue as an Eligible Person or Participant or in the employ or service of the Company or an Affiliate, (ii)  interfering in any way with the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate any Eligible Person&#8217;s or Participant&#8217;s  employment or service at any time, (iii) giving an Eligible Person or Participant any claim to be granted any Award under  the Plan or to be treated uniformly with other Participants and employees, or (iv) conferring on a Participant any of the  rights of a shareholder of the Company unless and until the Participant is duly issued or transferred shares of Stock in  accordance with the terms of an Award. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, neither the  Plan nor any Award Agreement shall confer on any person other than the Company and the Participant any rights or  remedies thereunder.

The Plan and  any Award Agreements contain the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and  supersede all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations and warranties  between them, whether written or oral with respect to the subject matter thereof. 12.20 Plan Term Unless earlier terminated by action of the Board of Directors, the Plan will remain in effect until such time as no Stock  remains available for delivery under the Plan, and the Company has no further rights or obligations under the Plan with  respect to outstanding Awards under the Plan; subject to Section 7.02 regarding Incentive Stock Options.  12.21 Gender and Number Except when otherwise indicated by the context, the masculine gender shall also include the feminine gender, and the  definitions of any term herein in the singular shall also include the plural. 12.22 General Creditor Status With respect to Awards and Accounts not denominated in Stock or Restricted Stock, each Participant and Beneficiary  shall be and remain an unsecured general creditor of the Company with respect to any payments due and owing to such  Participant or Beneficiary hereunder. All payments to persons entitled to benefits hereunder shall be made out of the  general assets of the Company and shall be solely the obligation of the Company. To the extent the Plan is a promise by  the Company to pay benefits in the future and it is the intention of the Company and Participants that the Plan be  &#8220;unfunded&#8221; for tax purposes (and for the purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as  amended).
