            SECTION 2.01 Revolving Commitments. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the
Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period in an
aggregate principal amount that will not result in such Lender's Revolving
Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment. Within the foregoing
limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower
may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

            SECTION 2.02 Revolving Loans and Revolving Borrowings.

            (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Revolving
Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans of the same Type made by the Lenders
ratably in accordance with the amounts of their respective Revolving
Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan required to be
made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided that the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender
shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Revolving Loans as
required.

            (b) Subject to Section 2.13, each Revolving Borrowing shall be
comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request
in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan
by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make
such Eurodollar Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect
any obligation or liability of any Loan Party with respect to such Eurodollar
Loan, including the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Eurodollar Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Borrowing, such Eurodollar Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000. At the time that
each ABR Borrowing is made, such ABR Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount
that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $500,000; provided
that an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is (i) equal to the
entire unused balance of the total Revolving Commitments, (ii) required to
finance the reimbursement of an LC

                                                                              31

Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.04(e) or (iii) required to refund the
Swing Line Loans as contemplated by Section 2.07(d). Revolving Borrowings of
more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there
shall not at any time be more than a total of ten (10) Eurodollar Borrowings
outstanding.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Eurodollar Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto
would end after the Maturity Date.

            SECTION 2.03 Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a
Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the
proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such
telephonic Revolving Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be
confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a
written Revolving Borrowing Request in substantially a form reasonably approved
by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and
written Revolving Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in
compliance with Section 2.02:

            (i) the aggregate amount of such Revolving Borrowing;

            (ii) the date of such Revolving Borrowing, which shall be a Business
Day;

            (iii) whether such Revolving Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or
a Eurodollar Borrowing;

            (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest
Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the
definition of "Interest Period" hereunder; and

            (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds
are to be disbursed.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. Promptly following receipt of a Revolving Borrowing Request in
accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender
of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Revolving Loan to be
made as part of the requested Revolving Borrowing.

                                                                              32

            SECTION 2.04 Letters of Credit.

            (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter or Credit) for its own account (or
for the account of any of the Subsidiaries), in a form (including the terms
governing presentation and payment) reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Bank,
at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period. In
the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit
application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by
the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

            (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been reasonably approved by the Issuing Bank) to
the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the
requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting
the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be
amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such
Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this
Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare,
amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank,
the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing
Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A
Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower
shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed
$5,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Exposure shall not exceed the total
Revolving Commitments. No Letter of Credit (or an amendment to increase the face
amount of, the renewal of or the extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit)
may be requested or issued when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.

            (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date unless (in the case of
this clause (ii)) such Letter of Credit has been cash collateralized to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Issuing Bank; provided, however, that any Letter
of Credit may provide for the automatic renewal thereof for additional periods
(subject to the right of the Issuing Bank to give the beneficiary notice of
termination of such Letter of Credit at the end of the then-current term
thereof); provided that the expiry date of any such automatically renewable
Letter of Credit shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause
(ii) above.

                                                                              33

            (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC
Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the
date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.04, or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or
reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such
payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
whatsoever.

            (e) Reimbursement.

                  (i) If the Issuing Bank, with respect to a LC Disbursement,
notifies the Borrower at or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date
that it intends to make such a disbursement, the Borrower, if it intends to
reimburse such disbursement directly, shall provide written or telephonic notice
(promptly confirmed by written notice) of such intention to the Administrative
Agent and the Issuing Bank and shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount
equal to such LC Disbursement, in each case no later than 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, on such date (the "Same Day Deadline").

                  (ii) If the Issuing Bank, with respect to a LC Disbursement,
notifies the Borrower after 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date that it
intends to make such a disbursement, the Borrower, if it intends to reimburse
such disbursement directly, shall provide written or telephonic notice (promptly
confirmed by written notice) of such intention to the Administrative Agent and
the Issuing Bank and shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to
such LC Disbursement, in each case, no later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on next Business Day following the date of such LC Disbursement (the "Next
Day Deadline").

                  (iii) If the Borrower does not reimburse the Administrative
Agent at or prior to the Same Day Deadline or the Next Day Deadline, as the case
may be, the Borrower will be deemed, automatically, to have made an ABR
Borrowing in the equivalent amount of such LC Disbursement at such time (without
regard to the requirements set forth in Section 4.02, to the minimum and
multiples requirements set forth in Section 2.02(c) or the notice requirement
set forth in Section 2.03) and the Borrower's obligations with respect to such
LC


<PAGE>

                                                                              34

Disbursement shall be deemed satisfied in full; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing no such ABR Borrowing shall be made if an Event of
Default under clause (o) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing at such
time. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of any
ABR Borrowing that is deemed to have been made pursuant to this paragraph. Such
notice shall include the principal amount in respect thereof and such Lender's
Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
Lender (in the manner provided in Section 2.05) shall pay to the Administrative
Agent its Applicable Percentage of the ABR Borrowing that is deemed to have been
made under this paragraph, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to
the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders.

                  (iv) The Issuing Bank shall also notify the Administrative
Agent of each such LC Disbursement at the same time it notifies the Borrower
pursuant to either clause (i) or (ii) above.

            (f) Obligations Absolute. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
the Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section
2.04(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or
provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment
by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section 2.04, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right
of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related
Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that nothing in this Section 2.04(f) shall be construed
to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any
direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which
are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law)
suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence
or willful misconduct or its failure to exercise care when determining whether
drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the
terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the


<PAGE>

                                                                              35

Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

            (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that, subject to Section
2.04(e), any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve
the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

            (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full pursuant to Section 2.04(e), the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest,
for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but
excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the
rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower
fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.04(e),
then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph
shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on
and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(e) to
reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent
of such payment.

            (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(d). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                                                                              36

            (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives written notice
demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph from the
Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, or from the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank (with notice to the Administrative
Agent), in each case without any action of the Required Lenders, if it in good
faith believes that time is of the essence, the Borrower shall deposit in an
account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent
and for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, an amount in cash equal
to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid letter of credit
fees thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral in an
account shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become
immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon
the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in
paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII. The Borrower also shall deposit cash
collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section
2.04(j) (i) at any time it elects to do so (any such deposit at the Borrower's
election, a "Voluntary Deposit") or (ii) as and to the extent required by
Section 2.09(b). Each such account shall be held by the Administrative Agent as
collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower
under this Agreement, and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in each such account and any
investments thereof and proceeds of the foregoing to secure such obligations.
The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including
the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account in accordance with the
terms of this Section 2.04(j). Other than any interest earned on the investment
of the amounts on deposit in such account, which investments shall be made in
Permitted Cash Equivalents at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent (provided that, at any time when no Default or Event of
Default is in existence, the Borrower shall have the right to select the
Permitted Cash Equivalents to be invested in) and at the Borrower's risk and
expense, such amounts on deposit in such account shall not bear interest.
Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such
account. The amounts on deposit in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for
which it has not been reimbursed in accordance with Section 2.04(e) (and any
accrued and unpaid letter of credit fees thereon not paid when due) and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of
the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an
amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the existence of an Event of
Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid), together with any
interest actually earned on such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid
during the continuance of such Event of Default), shall be returned to the
Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured
or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
hereunder pursuant to Section 2.09(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid), together with any interest actually earned on such amount (to the
extent not applied as aforesaid during the continuance of such Event of
Default), shall be returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that, after
giving effect to such return, the Borrower


<PAGE>

                                                                              37

would remain in compliance with Section 2.09(b) and no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing. If the Borrower makes a Voluntary Deposit, the
amount of such Voluntary Deposit, together with any interest actually earned
thereon, shall be disbursed to the Borrower as a New Extension of Revolver
Credit within one Business Day of demand therefor if and only if the conditions
set forth in Section 4.02 have been met on the date of such disbursement.

            SECTION 2.05 Funding of Revolving Borrowings.

            (a) Each Lender shall make each Revolving Loan to be made by it
hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative
Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;
provided that each ABR Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e)(iii) shall be made by each Lender by
2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date such ABR Loan is deemed to have been
made thereunder. The Administrative Agent will make such Revolving Loans
available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like
funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the
applicable Revolving Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Loans made to finance
the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e)(i) shall
be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank and ABR Loans made
to refund Swing Line Loans as provided in Section 2.07(d) shall be remitted by
the Administrative Agent to the Swing Line Lender.

            (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing that such Lender
will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.05(a) and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Revolving Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent,
then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent
at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective
Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lender's Revolving Loan included in such Revolving Borrowing. Payment by the
Borrower shall not constitute a waiver by the Borrower of any claim the Borrower
may have against the Lender that failed to make any payment required to be made
by it under this Agreement.

                                                                              38

            SECTION 2.06 Interest Elections.

            (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type
specified in the applicable Revolving Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Revolving Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such
Revolving Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Revolving Borrowing
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor,
all as provided in this Section 2.06. The Borrower may elect different options
with respect to different portions of the affected Revolving Borrowing, in which
case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders, and the
Revolving Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
Revolving Borrowing.

            (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.06, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Revolving Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the
Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic
Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly
by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
Election Request in substantially a form reasonably approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

            (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                  (i) the Revolving Borrowing to which such Interest Election
      Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect
      to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
      each resulting Revolving Borrowing (in which case the information to be
      specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for
      each resulting Revolving Borrowing);

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
      Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii) whether the resulting Revolving Borrowing is to be an
      ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                  (iv) if the resulting Revolving Borrowing is a Eurodollar
      Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving
      effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the
      definition of "Interest Period" hereunder.

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                                                                              39

            (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Revolving Borrowing.

            (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Eurodollar Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Eurodollar Borrowing
shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the
Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing
and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

            SECTION 2.07 Swing Line Loans.

            (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Borrower may request Swing Line Loans from the Swing Line Lender, at any
time and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period; provided
that Swing Line Loans shall be extended by the Swing Loan Lender only if (and
upon extension of each Swing Line Loan the Borrower shall be deemed to represent
and warrant that), after giving effect to such extension, (i) the Swing Line
Exposure shall not exceed $10,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Exposure
shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments. No Swing Line Loan may be
requested or extended when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swing Line Loans. Swing
Line Loans shall be ABR Loans only; provided that interest on Swing Line Loans
shall be computed in accordance with Section 2.12(a).

            (b) Expiration Date. The Borrower shall repay all outstanding Swing
Line Loans on the Maturity Date.

            (c) Swing Line Borrowings; Funding. To request a Swing Line
Borrowing, the Borrower shall give the Swing Line Lender irrevocable telephonic
notice confirmed promptly in writing (which telephonic notice must be received
by the Swing Line Lender not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
proposed date of such Swing Line Borrowing), specifying (i) the aggregate amount
of such Swing Line Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Swing Line Borrowing (which
shall be a Business Day) and (iii) the location and number of the Borrower's
account to which funds are to be disbursed. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be
in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less
than $500,000. Not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of any
Swing Line Borrowing specified in such Swing Line Borrowing Request, the Swing
Line Lender shall make each Swing Line Loan to be made by it by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the Administrative Agent most
recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Swing Line Lender.
The Administrative Agent will make such Swing Line Loans available to the

                                                                              40

Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Swing Line
Borrowing Request.

            (d) Refunding of Swing Line Loans. The Swing Line Lender, at any
time and from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion may, on behalf of
the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swing Line Lender to act on
its behalf), on one Business Day's notice given by the Swing Line Lender to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, request each Lender to make, and each Lender hereby agrees to make, a
Revolving Loan (which shall be an ABR Loan), in an amount equal to (i) such
Lender's Applicable Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal
amount of Swing Line Loans outstanding on the date of such notice, to repay the
Swing Line Lender. Each Lender shall make the amount of such Revolving Loans
available to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by
it for such purpose in immediately available funds, not later than 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, one Business Day after the date of such notice. The proceeds
of such Revolving Loans shall be made immediately available by the
Administrative Agent to the Swing Line Lender for application by the Swing Line
Lender to the repayment of the then outstanding Swing Line Loans and all of the
Borrower's obligations with respect to such Swing Line Loans shall be deemed
satisfied in full.

            (e) Participations. If prior to the time a Revolving Loan would have
otherwise been made pursuant to Section 2.07(d), one of the events described in
paragraphs (h) and (i) of Article VII shall have occurred and be continuing with
respect to the Borrower, or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swing
Line Lender in its sole discretion, Revolving Loans may not be made as
contemplated by Section 2.07(d), each Lender shall, on the date that such
Revolving Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in
Section 2.07(d) (the "Refunding Date"), purchase for cash an undivided
participating interest in the then outstanding Swing Line Loans by paying to the
Swing Line Lender an amount (the "Swing Line Participation Amount") equal to (i)
such Lender's Applicable Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate
principal amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding which were to have been
repaid with such Revolving Loans. Whenever, at any time after the Swing Line
Lender has received from any Lender such Lender's Swing Line Participation
Amount, the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of the Swing Line
Loans, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Swing Line
Participation Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments,
to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's participating interest
was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments,
to reflect such Lender's pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not
sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all Swing Line Loans then
due); provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the
Swing Line Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the
Swing Line Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swing
Line Lender.

            (f) Obligations Absolute. Each Lender's obligation to make the
Revolving Loans referred to in Section 2.07(d) and to purchase participating
interests pursuant to Section 2.07(e) shall be absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected


<PAGE>

                                                                              41

by any circumstance whatsoever, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing
Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii)
the reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments; (iii) the occurrence
or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default; (iv) any adverse change in
the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower; (v) any breach of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or
any other Lender; or (vi) any other circumstance, happening or event, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing.

            (g) Resignation of the Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender may
resign at any time upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Such resignation shall become
effective upon the earlier of (i) the appointment by the resigning Swing Line
Lender without the consent of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or the Borrower of a successor Swing Line Lender who is (or, at the time of
such appointment, will be) a Lender or (ii) the appointment by the Borrower with
the consent of the Required Lenders (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of a successor Swing Line Lender which is a commercial bank
or other financial institution organized under the laws of the United States of
America or any political subdivision thereof with an office in New York, New
York and which has combined capital and reserves in excess of $100,000,000;
provided that the Borrower shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to consult
with the resigning Swing Line Lender before any appointment is made pursuant to
clause (i) above. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Swing Line Lender
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Line Lender,
and the retiring Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Swing
Line Lender shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After a Swing Line
Lender's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 2.07 and Section
9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Swing Line
Lender, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as the
Swing Line Lender.

            SECTION 2.08 Termination and Optional Reduction of Revolving
Commitments.

            (a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall
terminate on the Maturity Date.

            (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Revolving Commitments without premium or penalty; provided that (i)
each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the
Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after
giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of Revolving Loans and Swing Line
Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Exposures would
exceed the total Revolving Commitments.


<PAGE>

                                                                              42

            (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of
this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(c) shall be irrevocable; provided that a
notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may
state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied.

            (d) Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall
be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with each Lender's Applicable Percentage. Any
termination of the Revolving Commitments shall result in the automatic
termination of all obligations of the Swing Line Lender to make Swing Line Loans
and all obligations of the Issuing Bank to issue, increase the face amount of,
renew or extend any outstanding Letter of Credit.

            SECTION 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

            (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date.

            (b) In the event and on such occasion that the sum of the Revolving
Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall prepay
Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral
in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(j)) in an
aggregate amount equal to such excess.

            (c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

            (e) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to Section
2.09(c) or Section 2.09(d) shall, to the extent permitted by law, be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided that


<PAGE>

                                                                              43

the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts
or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            (f) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested
by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered permitted assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered permitted assigns).

            SECTION 2.10 Optional Prepayment of Loans.

            (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Borrowing (or any accrued interest thereon) in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty, subject to the requirements of this Section
2.10.

            (b) Prior to any optional prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the
Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall
specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to Section
2.10(c); provided that if the Type of Borrowing is not specified, ABR Borrowings
shall be prepaid first. Any reduction of the Revolving Commitments under Section
2.08 shall be accompanied by prepayment of Loans to the extent the aggregate
amount of such Loans outstanding exceeds the total amount of the Revolving
Commitments as so reduced.

            (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment and (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on
the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment is
given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving
Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may
be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section
2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.12.

                                                                              44

            SECTION 2.11 Fees.

            (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at a rate of 0.50%
per annum on the average daily unused amount of each Revolving Commitment of
such Lender for each day during the period from and including the date hereof to
but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates. Accrued
commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the date on which any Revolving
Commitments of such Lender shall expire or terminate, commencing on the first
such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed
on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes
of computing commitment fees payable hereunder, the Revolving Commitment of each
Lender shall be deemed to be used only to the extent of the outstanding
Revolving Loans and LC Exposure (but not the outstanding Swing Line Loans) of
such Lender.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

            (c) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Bank
in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment
fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall
not be refundable under any circumstances.

            (d) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Margin as interest on Eurodollar Loans on the average daily amount of such
Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed
LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date hereof to but
excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and
the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the
Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates separately
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Issuing Bank on the average daily
amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date
hereof to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving
Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as
the Issuing Bank's customary fees with respect to the administration, issuance,
negotiation, payment, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
any processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the


<PAGE>

                                                                              45

Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on
which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other
fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable
within ten days after written demand. All participation fees and fronting fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for
the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day).

            SECTION 2.12 Interest.

            (a) The Loans (other than the Swing Line Loans) comprising each ABR
Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
Margin. The Swing Line Loans comprising each Swing Line Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; provided that
the Borrower may request the Swing Line Lender to offer a lower rate in respect
of any Swing Line Loan, which the Swing Line Lender may, but shall not be
obligated to, do, and if a lower rate is so offered, such Swing Line Loan shall
bear interest at such rate.

            (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in Section 2.12(a) or Section
2.12(b) or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to
ABR Loans as provided in Section 2.12(a).

            (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Revolving
Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.10(c)
shall be payable on demand and (ii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such
conversion.

            (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.13 Alternate Rate of Interest.

            If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar
Borrowing:


<PAGE>

                                                                              46

            (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
be conclusive absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances arising
after the date hereof affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest
Period; or

            (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included
in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (provided that the
Administrative Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to determine
whether or not the circumstances which have caused the notice, continue to exist
and to notify the Borrower and the Lenders when such circumstances cease to
exist) (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any
Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Revolving Borrowing
Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.14 Increased Costs.

            (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
      deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
      account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
      requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank any other
      condition (other than a condition relating to any Tax, it being understood
      that any Change in Law relating to an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax shall
      be governed by Section 2.16 hereof) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar
      Loans made by such Lender (or any Letter of Credit or participation
      therein);

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay in accordance with, and subject to the notice requirements and
limitations specified in, Sections 2.14(c) and 2.14(d) to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.


<PAGE>

                                                                              47

            (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by,
such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level
below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's
holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such
Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy),
then from time to time the Borrower will pay in accordance with, and subject to
the notice requirements and limitations specified in, Sections 2.14(c) and
2.14(d) to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

            (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.14(a) and 2.14(b),
the Borrower shall not be required to make any payment otherwise required by
such Sections to any Lender unless such Lender is generally demanding payment
under comparable provisions of its agreements with similarly situated borrowers.
A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of (and method of calculation of) the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may
be, as specified in Section 2.14 (a) or 2.14(b) shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. The Borrower shall
pay such Lender or Issuing Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within 15 days after receipt thereof.

            (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall not constitute a waiver
of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section 2.14 for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention
to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

            SECTION 2.15 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
2.10(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any
Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then,
in any such event,

                                                                              48

the Borrower shall compensate each affected Lender for the loss, cost and
expense attributable to such event. In the case of any applicable Eurodollar
Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an
amount reasonably determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the then-effective Adjusted LIBO Rate (for the
avoidance of doubt, without the addition of any Applicable Margin) that would
have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to
the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such
Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of (and method of calculation of) any amount or amounts that such
Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15
days after receipt thereof.

                  SECTION 2.16 Taxes.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all payments
by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower to any Lender (including the
Administrative Agent, if applicable), the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to withhold or deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16(a)) the
Administrative Agent, Lender, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions or
withholding and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, except for
any Taxes or other liabilities that the Borrower is contesting in good faith by
appropriate proceedings; provided, however, that the Borrower shall indemnify
within 30 days of written demand therefor the Administrative Agent, each Lender,
the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and hold each
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, fees and additional expenses
with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying, or omission to pay, such
Taxes.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Borrower shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender, the Swing Line Lender and the
Issuing Bank within 30 days after receipt of written demand therefor, for the
full amount of any

<PAGE>
                                                                              49

Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender,
the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank, on or with respect to any payment by
or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other
Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on or asserted
on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The
Administrative Agent, each Lender, the Swing Line Lender or Issuing Bank, as
applicable, shall include with any such demand a statement setting forth the
basis and calculation of any such payment or indemnity hereunder, which
statement shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as
to the amount thereof.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall, upon request, deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment (to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor), a copy of the
return reporting such payment or such other evidence of such payment that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Each Foreign Lender that is eligible for any exemption
from or reduction of any withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in
which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party, with respect to payments under this Agreement or under any other Loan
Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
completed and duly executed tax forms, certificates and other documentation
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Each
Domestic Lender that is not a domestic corporation (as such terms are defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) an original Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any
successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, properly
completed and duly executed, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law.
Each such Person shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) such new tax forms, certificates and other documentation
upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered tax forms,
certificates or other documentation, or after the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the most recent tax forms, certificates or other
documentation delivered by such Person, as applicable. Each such Person shall
provide written notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
at any time it determines that it is no longer legally able to provide any
previously delivered tax form, certificate or other documentation (or any other
form of certification adopted by the Internal Revenue Service for such purpose).

                  (f) If the Borrower is required to indemnify the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank,
pursuant to Section 2.16(c), for any Indemnified Tax whose full grossed-up
amount was accurately and actually withheld or deducted by the Borrower in
accordance with Section 2.16(a); and the

<PAGE>
                                                                              50

Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting
such Indemnified Tax, then such Person shall cooperate with the Borrower in
challenging such Indemnified Tax at the Borrower's expense if so requested, in
writing, by the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Swing
Line Lender or the Issuing Bank receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with
respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.16 and provided evidence thereof pursuant to Section 2.16(d), such
Person shall within 30 days from the date of the receipt of such refund pay over
to the Borrower (i) such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with
respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net
of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Person and (ii)
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund; provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank
shall repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties, interest or
other charges) to such Person in the event such Person is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.16(f) shall not be
construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Swing Line
Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other
information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower
or any other Person.

                  SECTION 2.17 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing
of Setoffs.

                  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made
by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal,
interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under
Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or
counterclaim subject to Section 2.16 hereof. Any amounts received after 3:00
p.m., New York City time, on any date may, in the reasonable discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 745 Seventh Avenue,
New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and
payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified
therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by
it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due
on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first,

<PAGE>
                                                                              51

towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in
such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon
than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and the
accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent
of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section
2.17(c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower
pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise (to the extent
permitted hereunder) against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender or
the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank, the amount
due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each
of the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank severally agrees to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed
to such Lender, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

                                                                              52

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                  SECTION 2.18 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

                  (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
then such Person shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the reasonable judgment of such Person, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the
case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Person to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Person. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any such Person in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, or if, in
compliance with the requirements of the last sentence of Section 9.02(b), any
Lender fails or refuses to consent to any waiver or amendment of any provision
of this Agreement that (i) would otherwise require the consent of a greater
percentage of Lenders than the percentage specified in the definition of
"Required Lenders" hereunder and (ii) is actually consented to or approved by
the Required Lenders, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and, if necessary
the Issuing Bank, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon
notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment
of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations
in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the
case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction
in such compensation or payments. No Lender shall be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Person or

<PAGE>
                                                                              53

otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

Borrower or such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law.

                  SECTION 3.03 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as
have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and filings

material agreement or material instrument binding upon any Loan Party or any of
their assets, or given rise to a right thereunder to require any material
payment to be made by any Loan Party and (d) have not and will not result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of any Loan Party, except Liens
created under the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 3.04 Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Effect.

                  (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders
audited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of operations,

Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower and
each of its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in
accordance with GAAP.

                  (b) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred
to above or the notes thereto or in the Borrower's annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003, except for the Disclosed Matters, after giving effect to the
Transactions, none of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries has, as of date hereof,
any material contingent liabilities, unusual long-term commitments or material
unrealized losses.

                  (c) Since December 31, 2003 no event has occurred which has
had, or which could reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  SECTION 3.05 Properties.

                  (a) Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has good title
to, or valid leasehold interests or license rights in, all real and personal
property material to its business, except for minor defects in title that do not
interfere in any material respect with its ability to conduct its business as
currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes
and except for Permitted Liens.

                  (b) As of the date hereof, neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has received notice of, or has knowledge of, any pending or
contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any material real property owned
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any sale or disposition thereof in lieu of

                  SECTION 3.06 Litigation and Environmental Matters.

                  (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before
any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened (including any investigations relating to any potential
action, suit or proceeding) against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (i) that
could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve
any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

                  (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect
to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, none of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law
or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit,

<PAGE>
                                                                              55

license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become
subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim
with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any
Environmental Liability.

                  (c) Since the date hereof, there has been no change in the
status of the Disclosed Matters which change, individually or in the aggregate,
has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  SECTION 3.07 Compliance with Laws and Agreements; No Default.

                  (a) Each Loan Party is in compliance with (i) all laws,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
property (including, without limitation, with any licenses, consents or
approvals issued by any Governmental Authority necessary for such Loan Party to
operate its Systems and conduct its business in the manner in which it is being
conducted), except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) the terms of all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

                  SECTION 3.08 Investment and Holding Company Status. No Loan
Party is (a) an "investment company" subject to regulation under, and as defined
in, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (b) a "holding company,"
subject to regulation under, and as defined in, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended.

                  SECTION 3.09 Taxes. Each Loan Party has timely filed or caused
to be timely filed all material Tax returns that are required to have been filed
and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to be paid by it and any
assessments made against it or any of its property by any Governmental
Authority, except, in each case, (a) Taxes that are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Loan Party,
as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with
GAAP or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan for which there exists an
accumulated benefit obligation (based on the assumptions used for purposes of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of
the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair
market value of the assets of such Plan as of such date by an amount that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and the present value
of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the
assumptions

<PAGE>
                                                                              56

used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did
not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such
amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded
Plans as of such date by an amount that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.11 Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the
Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which
any Loan Party is subject, and all other matters known to any of them, that, as
of the date hereof in each case, individually or in the aggregate could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the
reports, financial statements, certificates or other written information
furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented by
other information so furnished, taken as a whole) contained as of the date
furnished any material misstatement of material fact or omitted to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading as of the
date thereof; provided that, with respect to projected financial information and
other projections and forward looking information, the Borrower represents only
that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed
to be reasonable at the time made (it being understood that no assurance has

or Contractual Obligation (other than, in the case of clause (b) below, any
restriction under Section 6.08) applicable to the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a)

hereof.

                  SECTION 3.15 Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of

the Subsidiaries to) promptly notify the Administrative Agent and, upon the
reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, provide duly completed and

Agent and the Lenders as the Administrative Agent reasonably may request in

knowledge of the Borrower, threatened. With such exceptions as could not

have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other
applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters and
(ii) all payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any
claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages,
employee health and welfare benefits and/or other employee benefits, including

or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.

unconsolidated basis, and the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis,
respectively; (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of the Borrower,
on an unconsolidated basis, and the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis, will
be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability
of the Borrower, on an unconsolidated basis, and the Loan Parties, on a
consolidated basis, respectively, on such liabilities as they become absolute

Borrower, on an unconsolidated basis, and the Loan Parties, on a consolidated
basis, will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the
business in which they are engaged as such business is now conducted or is about
to be conducted following the date hereof. With respect to any such contingent
liabilities, such liabilities shall be computed at the amount which, in light of
all the facts and circumstances existing at the time, represents the amount
which can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

                  SECTION 3.19 FCC Compliance.

                  (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19, the Borrower and

                  (b) The Borrower holds all of the Licenses required to operate
its System and to conduct its business in the manner in which it is being

full force and effect. There are pending at the FCC no applications for the
modification, transfer or assignment of any of such Licenses other than those
proposed or consented to by the Borrower that if granted by the FCC would not
cause a Default or an Event of Default to occur. None of such Licenses is
subject to any condition other than conditions generally applicable to stations
of the same class and type by virtue of the Communications Act or conditions
contained in such licenses.

                  (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19, the Borrower and
each Subsidiary have no knowledge of any investigation, notice of apparent
liability, violation, forfeiture or other order or formal complaint issued by or
before the FCC, or of any other proceedings (other than proceedings relating to
the commercial wireless communications industries generally) of or before the
FCC, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) No event has occurred which (i) results in, or after
notice or lapse of time or both would result in, revocation, suspension, adverse
modification, non-renewal, impairment, restriction or termination of, or order
of forfeiture with respect to, any License in any respect which could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) affects or could
reasonably be expected in the future to affect any of the rights of the Borrower
or any Subsidiary under any License held by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in
any respect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (e) The Borrower and each Subsidiary have duly filed all
filings (including reports, applications, notices, documents, instruments and
other information) required to be filed by it under the Communications Act, and
all such filings were when made timely, true, correct and complete in all
respects, except where the failure to file or to be timely, true, correct and
complete could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                                                              59

                  (f) The Borrower and each Subsidiary have duly filed and paid
all fees (including charges, fines, assessments and contributions) required to
be filed and paid by them under the Communications Act and all such fees were
when filed timely and complete in all respects, except where the failure to file
and pay or to be timely and complete could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (g) The Borrower has no reason to believe that each License of
the Borrower or any Subsidiary will not be renewed in the ordinary course except
as individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (h) The Borrower has no reason to believe that its status as a
carrier eligible to receive federal universal service support funds will be
revoked or adversely modified with respect to any Service Region where it has
been designated by the FCC as being eligible to receive such funds, except where
such revocation or modification could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.20 Security Documents.

                  (a) The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement is effective to
create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the
Collateral (as defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement) and (i) when
financing statements in appropriate form are filed in the offices specified in
the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, such security interest shall constitute
a perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of
the grantors thereunder in such Collateral in which a security interest can be
perfected by filing under the Uniform Commercial Code and (ii) when the
Collateral which may be perfected by possession or control is delivered to the
Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent obtains control over such
Collateral, such security interest shall constitute a perfected Lien on, and
security interest in, all right, title and interest of the pledgors thereunder
in such Collateral, in each case subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens;
provided that, in the case of any Permitted Junior Liens on any assets or
property included in the Collateral, the Liens securing the Obligations take
priority over such Permitted Junior Liens and, in the case of Liens permitted
under clause (n) of the definition of "Permitted Encumbrances" hereunder on any
assets or property included in the Collateral, such Permitted Liens are equal
and ratable with the Liens securing the Obligations.

                  (b) When the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (or any short
form thereof mutually agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
for purposes of such filing) is filed in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and the United States Copyright Office and steps are taken under
applicable foreign law to the extent of Intellectual Property created under such
law, and, with respect to Intellectual Property in which a security interest
cannot be perfected solely by such filings, upon the filing of the financing
statements referred to in Section 3.20(a) above, the security interest granted
pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement shall constitute a perfected
Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of the grantors

<PAGE>
                                                                              60

thereunder in the Intellectual Property included in the Collateral (it being
understood that subsequent recordings in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and the United States Copyright Office and steps taken under applicable
foreign law with respect to Intellectual Property included in the Collateral
created under such law may be necessary to perfect a lien on registered
trademarks, trademark applications, patents, patent applications and registered
copyrights and copyright applications acquired by the grantors after the date
hereof), in each case subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens; provided
that, in the case of any Permitted Junior Liens on any Intellectual Property
included in the Collateral, the Liens securing the Obligations take priority
over such Permitted Junior Liens and, in the case of Liens permitted under
clause (n) of the definition of "Permitted Encumbrances" hereunder on any
Intellectual Property included in the Collateral, such Permitted Liens are equal
and ratable with the Liens securing the Obligations.

                  SECTION 3.21 Copyrights, Trademarks, etc. The Borrower and the
Subsidiaries own, or are licensed to use, all copyrights, trademarks, trade
names, patents, technology, know-how and processes, service marks and rights
with respect to the foregoing that are (a) used in or necessary for the conduct
of their respective businesses as currently conducted and (b) material to the
business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
properties or business prospects of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, taken as a whole. To the knowledge of the Borrower the use
of such copyrights, trademarks, trade names, patents, technology, know-how and
processes, service marks and rights with respect to the foregoing by the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries do not infringe on the rights of any Person, in
any respect that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.22 Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, there is
no preferred stock of the Borrower or any Subsidiary issued and outstanding
except as set forth in the definition of "Existing Preferred Stock" hereunder.

                  SECTION 3.23 Senior Debt. The Obligations constitute "Senior
Indebtedness" under the terms of the Existing Subordinated Notes, "First Lien
Obligations" under the terms of the New Senior Secured Notes and "Senior Lender
Claims" under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

                  (r) any termination (prior to the expiration of its term),
revocation, impairment, modification or non-renewal by the FCC of one or more
Licenses of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, or any grant by the Borrower of
any interests in, or filing by the Borrower of any application for FCC consent
to the transfer of, any License, if such termination, revocation, impairment,
modification, non-renewal, grant or transfer could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (s) the FCC shall deliver to the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries an order to show cause why an order of revocation should not be
issued to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to any Licenses,
and (i) such order shall not have been rescinded within 120 days after such
delivery or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the Required Lenders, proceedings
by or before the FCC related to such order are reasonably likely to result in
one or more orders of revocation and would constitute an Event of Default under
clause (r) hereof;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent, at the request
of the Required Lenders, shall, or if the Administrative Agent in good faith
believes that time is of the essence, then without any action of the Required
Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, by notice to the Borrower, take either or
both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)
declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part,
in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter
be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any
event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) (other than an
event described in subclause (vi) of clause (i)) of this Article, the
Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then
outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other
obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due
and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

                  Each of the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuing
Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to
exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms
of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto.

                                                                              91

                  The institution serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder
shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent,
and such institution and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary
or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing (a) the Administrative Agent shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the
Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing
by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c)
except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries
that is communicated to or obtained by the institution serving as Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the
Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in
connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan
Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability to any Lender for relying upon, any notice,
request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper
Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it
orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it in its reasonable discretion, and
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with
the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts selected by it in its
reasonable discretion.

                                                                              92

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion. The
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such
sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any legal counsel, independent accountant or other
expert or any agent or attorney in fact, in each case, that it selects in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, (i) the Administrative Agent
may resign at any time upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders, the Swing Line
Lender, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower, (ii) the Borrower, with the consent
of the Required Lenders, may elect to remove the Administrative Agent in the
event that the Administrative Agent's Commitment is less than $5,000,000 upon 30
days notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender and
the Issuing Bank and (iii) the Required Lenders may elect to remove the
Administrative Agent at any time upon 30 days notice to the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the Issuing Bank. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the
Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long
as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to appoint a successor
from among the Lenders which is a commercial bank organized under the laws of
the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof with an office
in New York, New York and which has combined capital and reserves in excess of
$500,000,000. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may with the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be required if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing), on behalf of the Lenders, the Swing
Line Lender and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a commercial bank or other financial institution that in each case has
and will continue to have the ability to fund revolving bank loans in the
ordinary course of its business on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Loan Documents and is organized under the laws of the United States of America
or any political subdivision thereof with an office in New York, New York and
with combined capital and reserves in excess of $200,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to

<PAGE>
                                                                              93

its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After an Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

                  None of the Lenders identified on the facing page of this
Agreement or elsewhere herein as a "Documentation Agent" shall have any right,
power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other
than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any other Lender (including any Lender
identified as a "Documentation Agent") and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any other Lender (including any Lender
identified as a "Documentation Agent") and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder
or thereunder.

Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number or electronic mail
address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other

in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
given on the date of receipt. Electronic mail and Internet and intranet websites
may be used only to distribute the financial statements and other information as

parties thereto, and may not be used for any other purpose unless consented to
by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing prior to any applicable
distribution, notice or other communication.

                  SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments.

                  (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

<PAGE>
                                                                              95

exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or the
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default
or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
such Default or Event of Default at the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders unless
such Loan Document provides otherwise; provided that no such agreement shall (i)
increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such
Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of
interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written
consent of each Lender whose Loan, interest or fees are so reduced, (iii)
postpone the Maturity Date (or the scheduled date of payment of the principal
amount of any Loan if this Agreement is amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified to include scheduled principal payment dates other than the Maturity
Date), postpone the scheduled date of payment of any interest on any Loan, or
any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such
payment without the consent of each Lender whose payments of principal, interest
or fees are so postponed, reduced, waived or excused, (iv) postpone the
scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment of any Lender, without the
written consent of such Lender, (v) amend, supplement or otherwise modify any
provisions of or directly applicable to any Letter of Credit or Section 2.04
without the written consent of the Issuing Bank, (vi) change Section 2.08(d),
2.17(b) or 2.17(c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of
commitment reductions or payments required thereby within a single tranche of
Loans, without the written consent of each Lender holding Loans in such tranche,
(vii) change the percentage specified in the definition of "Required Lenders"
hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) release any
Guarantor that owns assets with an aggregate value greater than $1,000,000 from
its Guarantee under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (except as expressly
provided in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and except in connection with
any sale or other disposition of the equity of any Guarantor permitted hereunder
or consented to by the Required Lenders) without the written consent of each
Lender or (ix) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens
of the Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender; provided,
further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise directly affect
the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of the

<PAGE>
                                                                              96

Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be
amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required
Lenders, (and, if its rights or obligations are directly affected thereby, the
Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may
be) if (i) by the terms of such agreement the Revolving Commitment of each
Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon
the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at the time such amendment becomes
effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the
principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts
owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Section 9.02, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the
written consent of the Borrower and the Required Lenders (x) to increase the
aggregate Revolving Commitments of the Lenders, (y) to add one or more
additional tranches of Loans or other loans to this Agreement and to permit the
extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued
interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the other then outstanding
Obligations and (z) to include appropriately the Lenders or other financial
institutions holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required
Lenders; provided that at no time shall the respective Revolving Commitment of
any Lender be increased without the consent of such Lender.

                  SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

                  (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, including due diligence expenses,
and the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for the
Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the revolving credit
facility provided for herein, the preparation, execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions
thereof (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank
in connection with the negotiation, payment, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Swing Line
Lender and the Issuing Bank in connection with any restructuring or workout of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
including, prior to the occurrence and continuation of any Event of Default, the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of one counsel for the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders and, during the occurrence and continuation of any Event of
Default, one counsel for the Administrative Agent and one counsel for the
Lenders, and (iv) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any Lender,
including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any Lender, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection
with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder. The Borrower shall
also pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the creation and perfection of the security interests
contemplated by the

<PAGE>
                                                                              97

Loan Documents, including all filing, recording and similar fees and the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection therewith.

                  (b) The Borrower shall, without duplication of amounts
indemnified under Section 2.16, indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank, the Swing Line Lender and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of
the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of any actual or threatened claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory
and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto) in respect of (i)
the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or
instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan
Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the
Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any
Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any
failure of the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of
Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit) or (iii) any actual or alleged
presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or
operated by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental
Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the extent permitted by law, the Borrower and each
Lender agree that if any indemnification or reimbursement sought pursuant to
paragraph (b) above is judicially determined to be unavailable for a reason
other than the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, then,
whether or not any Lender is the Indemnitee, the Borrower, on the one hand, and
the Lenders, on the other hand, shall contribute to the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification or reimbursement is held
unavailable (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits to the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders, on the other hand, in
connection with the transactions to which such indemnification or reimbursement
relates, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is judicially
determined not to be permitted, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative
faults of the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders, on the other hand, as well
as any other equitable considerations.

                  (d) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swing Line Lender under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the

<PAGE>
                                                                              98

Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may
be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line
Lender in its capacity as such and provided, further, that payments by the
Lenders to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this sentence shall be returned
to the Lenders to the extent the Borrower subsequently pays such unpaid amount.

shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Transactions, any
Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (f) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable within
ten Business Days of written demand therefor.

unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

                           (A) the Borrower; provided, that no consent of the
                  Borrower shall be required for an assignment (i) by the
                  Administrative Agent or the Documentation Agent or their
                  Affiliates until the earlier of the date determined pursuant

                  such clause (f) that arises from an event or condition
                  described in clause (g)) has occurred and is continuing, any
                  other assignee; and

                           (B) the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank;
                  provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent and the
                  Issuing Bank shall be required for an assignment to an
                  assignee that is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, or an
                  Approved Fund.

                           (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following
         additional conditions:

                           (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender,
                  an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, the amount of
                  the Revolving Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender

                  delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
                  $2,500,000 or, if smaller, the entire remaining amount of the
                  assigning Lender's Revolving Commitment or Loans, unless each
                  of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall otherwise
                  consent; provided, that (i) no such consent of the Borrower
                  shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is
                  continuing , (ii) in the event of concurrent assignments to
                  two or more assignees that are Affiliates of one another, or
                  to two or more Approved Funds managed by the same investment
                  advisor or by affiliated investment advisors, all such
                  concurrent assignments shall be aggregated in determining
                  compliance with this subsection and (iii) no assignment may be
                  made without (subject to clause (i) of this proviso) the
                  consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent if the
                  assigning Lender would have, after giving effect to such
                  assignment, Revolving Commitments and, without duplication,
                  Loans owing to it of less than the lesser of (A) $5,000,000

                  (B) 5.0% of the Revolving Commitments and, without
                  duplication, Loans of all Lenders;

                           (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an
                  assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
                  Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
                  other Loan Documents;

                           (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
                  deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
                  Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
                  $4,500, which fee shall not be payable (i) by any Affiliate of
                  an assigning Lender or (ii) by any Loan Party (except in the
                  case where a Lender is required to make an assignment pursuant
                  to Section 2.18(b)); provided that in the event of concurrent
                  assignments to two or more assignees that are Affiliates of
                  one another, or to two or more Approved Funds managed by the
                  same investment advisor or by affiliated investment advisors,
                  only one such fee shall be payable;

                           (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
                  deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
                  Questionnaire;

                           (E) the assignee shall be a financial institution, or
                  any other entity that has and will continue to have the
                  ability to fund revolving bank loans (including the Loans) in
                  the ordinary course of its business on the terms and
                  conditions set forth in the Loan Documents; and

                           (F) in the case of an assignment by a Lender to a CLO
                  managed by such Lender or by an Affiliate of such Lender,
                  unless such assignment (or an assignment to a CLO managed by
                  the same manager or an Affiliate of such manager) shall have
                  been approved by the Borrower in writing (the Borrower hereby
                  agreeing that such approval, if requested, will not be
                  unreasonably withheld or delayed), the assigning Lender shall
                  retain the sole right to approve any amendment, modification
                  or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, except that the
                  Assignment and Acceptance between such Lender and such CLO may
                  provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of such
                  CLO, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described
                  in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such CLO.

                           (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
         pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, from and after the effective
         date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee
         thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
         assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
         obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
         Documents, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of
         the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released
         from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
         Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this

<PAGE>
                                                                             101

         Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
         continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16
         and 9.03 for claims arising before it ceased to be a party hereto) and
         the other Loan Documents.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New
York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving
Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line
Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 9.04(a), 9.04(b) or 9.04(e), the Loans, drawn Letters of Credit, any
participations in issued or amended Letters of Credit deemed purchased pursuant
to Section 2.04(d), any Revolving Loans deemed to have been made pursuant to
Section 2.07(d), any undivided participation interests in Swing Line Loans
purchased pursuant to Section 2.07(e) and any participations sold pursuant to
Section 9.04(f) are registered obligations and the right, title, and interest of
the Lenders, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuing Bank and their assignees in and
to such Loans shall be transferable only upon notation of such transfer in the
Register. Any promissory note issued by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.09(f)
shall only evidence the Lender's or its registered permitted assign's right,
title and interest in and to the related Loan, and in no event is any such
promissory note to be considered a bearer instrument or obligation. This Section
9.04 shall be construed so that the Loans, drawn Letters of Credit, deemed
participations in issued or amended Letters of Credit, deemed Revolving Loans,
undivided participation interests in Swing Line Loans or participations sold
pursuant to Section 9.04(f), as the case may be, are at all times maintained in
"registered form" within the meaning of sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2)
of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations. Solely for purposes of this
and for tax purposes only, the Administrative Agent shall act as the Borrower's
agent for purposes of maintaining the Register and such notations of transfer in
the Register.

                  (e) (i) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) of this Section and any written consents to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                                                                             102

                           (ii) By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be
deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as
follows: (A) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial
owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim
created by such assigning Lender and that its Revolving Commitment and the
outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case without giving effect to
assignments thereof that have not become effective, are as set forth in such
Assignment and Acceptance; (B) except as set forth in clause (A) above, such
assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, or the
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of any of the foregoing, or the financial condition of the Loan Parties or the
performance or observance by the Loan Parties of any of their obligations under
this Agreement or under any other Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (C) each of the assignee and the
assignor represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into
such Assignment and Acceptance; (D) such assignee confirms that it has received
a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of any amendments or consents
entered into prior to the date of such Assignment and Acceptance and copies of
the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (E)
such assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (F) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents as are delegated to it by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) such
assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the
obligations that by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (f) Any Lender may, without the consent of or notice to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Lender,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each, a
"Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing
to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, Swing Line Lender and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan
Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of

<PAGE>
                                                                             103

the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in
clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that
affects such Participant. Subject to Section 9.04(g), the Borrower agrees that
each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits and obligations of Sections
2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired
its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18 and to the obligations of
Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16, in each case, as though it were a Lender. To the
extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits
of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to
be subject to Section 2.17(c) and Section 2.18 as though it were a Lender.

                  (g) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender,
or would be a Domestic Lender that is not a domestic corporation (as such terms
are defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) if it were a Lender, shall not
be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of
the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16 and Section 2.18 as though
it were a Lender.

                  (h) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not
apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no
such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any
of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto; and provided further, that any foreclosure or similar
action by such Federal Reserve Bank shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.04 concerning assignments.

                  (i) In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in
revolving bank loans, such Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights
under the Loan Documents, including the Loans and any instrument evidencing its
rights as a Lender under the Loan Documents, to any holder of, trustee for, or
any other representative of holders of obligations owed or securities issued by
such fund, as security for such obligations or securities; provided that any
foreclosure or similar action by such trustee or representative shall be subject
to the provisions of this Section 9.04 concerning assignments; and provided,
further, that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release
a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                  SECTION 9.05 Survival. All representations and warranties made
by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other
parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents and the making of any Loans and

<PAGE>
                                                                             104

issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank, Swing Line Lender or any Lender may have had
constructive (but not actual) notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
not cash collateralized and so long as the Revolving Commitments have not
expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and
Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit
and the Revolving Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

                  SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
and expenses payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract
among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and
all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall
become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto,
and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time
and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender
to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held
by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender under this Section 9.08 are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. Any

                                                                             105

Lender exercising a set-off pursuant to this Section 9.08 shall give notice
thereof to the Borrower as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

                  SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service
of Process.

                  (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
(subject to any right to appeal) in any such action or proceeding may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner

action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of

SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE

                  SECTION 9.12 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank, Swing Line Lender and the Lenders agrees to maintain
the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential and be bound by the provisions hereof), in each
case, as need to know, (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority,
(c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena
or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with and in furtherance of the exercise of any remedies hereunder or
any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section
(or an agreement to otherwise comply with the provisions of this Section), to
any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant
in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent
of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes
available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, Swing Line Lender or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower;
provided that prior to disclosure pursuant to clause (c), the relevant party
shall (to the extent that is lawfully permitted to do so, as determined by it in
consultation with counsel) give reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to
the Borrower to give the Borrower the opportunity to seek a protective order.
For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received
from the Borrower or any Loan Party relating to the Borrower, any other Loan
Party or the business of any Loan Party, other than any such information that is
available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, Swing Line Lender or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any
Loan Party. Subject to the foregoing, any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised
reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information.
