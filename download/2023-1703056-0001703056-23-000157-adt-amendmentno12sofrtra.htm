<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Execution Version    AMENDMENT AGREEMENT NO. 12  Dated as of May 10, 2023  between  PRIME SECURITY SERVICES BORROWER, LLC,  as Borrower,  and  BARCLAYS BANK PLC,  as Administrative Agent                          1  AMENDMENT AGREEMENT NO. 12    This AMENDMENT AGREEMENT NO. 12 (this &#8220;Agreement&#8221;), dated as of May 10,  2023, is made by and between Prime Security Services Borrower, LLC, a Delaware limited liability  company (the &#8220;Borrower&#8221;), and Barclays Bank PLC, as Administrative Agent under the Existing Credit  Agreement (as defined below) (in such capacity, the &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221;).  PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:  (1) Prime Security Services Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company  (&#8220;Holdings&#8221;), the Borrower, The ADT Security Corporation, a Delaware corporation, the Lenders party  thereto from time to time and the Administrative Agent are party to that certain Eleventh Amended and  Restated First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015, as amended and restated on May 2, 2016,  June 23, 2016, December 28, 2016, February 13, 2017, June 29, 2017, March 16, 2018, December 3, 2018,  March 15, 2019 (effective as of April 4, 2019), September 23, 2019, January 27, 2021 and July 2, 2021 (as  may be further amended, restated, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time prior to  the Effective Date (as defined below), the &#8220;Existing Credit Agreement&#8221;).  (2) The Administrative Agent and the Borrower have determined that a public  statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Rate  (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) has announced that all available tenors of such benchmark  (or such component thereof) will no longer be representative as of July 1, 2023. The Administrative Agent  and the Borrower have therefore determined in accordance with Section 2.14(b)(i) of the Existing Credit  Agreement that a Benchmark Transition Event shall occur on July 1, 2023 (such time, the &#8220;Amendment  Effective Time&#8221;) and therefore the LIBO Rate should be replaced with Adjusted Term SOFR as an  alternative benchmark rate for purposes of the Existing Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents  for settings of benchmark rates that occur on or after the Amendment Effective Time pursuant to a  benchmark replacement amendment in accordance with the benchmark replacement provisions set forth in  any applicable Loan Document without any further action or consent of any other party to the Existing  Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, and pursuant thereto the Administrative Agent is exercising  its right to make certain benchmark replacement conforming changes in connection with the  implementation of the applicable benchmark replacement as set forth herein.   (3) The Administrative Agent and the Borrower desire to memorialize the terms of  this Agreement and to make certain other changes set forth herein and in the Amended and Restated Credit  Agreement (as defined below), by amending and restating, in accordance with Section 9.08 of the Existing  Credit Agreement, the Existing Credit Agreement as set forth below, such amendment and restatement to  become effective at the Amendment Effective Time.  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and for  other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, and  subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:  SECTION 1. Defined Terms.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the  meanings assigned to such terms in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.    SECTION 2. Transition to Adjusted Term SOFR. Notwithstanding any other provision herein  or in any other Loan Document, any Loan that constitutes a Eurocurrency Loan (as defined in the Existing  Credit Agreement) that is outstanding as of the Amendment Effective Time shall continue until the end of  the applicable Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan and the provisions of the Existing Credit  Agreement applicable thereto shall continue and remain in effect (notwithstanding the occurrence of the    2    Amendment Effective Time) until the end of the applicable Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan,  after which time such provisions shall have no further force or effect; provided that, for the avoidance of  doubt, at any time on and after the Amendment Effective Time, the Borrower shall not be permitted to  request a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of, any Eurocurrency Loan that is a Loan outstanding  as of the Amendment Effective Time.   SECTION 3. Representations and Warranties.

Such Spot Rate shall  become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rate employed in converting any  amounts between the Dollars and each Alternate Currency until the next Revaluation Date to occur.

Each Revolving Facility Lender shall notify  the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m., 10 Business Days after receipt of such request  whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Revolving Loans in such requested currency.  (c) Any failure by a Revolving Facility Lender to respond to such request within  the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Revolving  Facility Lender to permit Revolving Loans to be made in such requested currency.  If the Administrative  Agent and all the Revolving Facility Lenders consent to making Revolving Loans in such requested  currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and such currency shall thereupon be  deemed for all purposes to be an Alternate Currency hereunder for purposes of any Borrowings of  Revolving Loans.

If, in relation to the currency of any such member  state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be  inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of  interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice  with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided  that if any Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such  date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing, at the end of the then current  Interest Period.  (b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes  of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect  the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market  conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

On or after the Eleventh Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement Effective Date,  Revolving Facility Loans may be allocated between the Borrower and any Co-Borrower by the Borrower  in its sole discretion so long as the Borrower will continue to remain a Borrower hereunder or become a  Guarantor.  (b) Each Borrower&#8217;s obligations with respect to Revolving Facility Loans made or  allocated to it, and each Borrower&#8217;s obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of such  Borrower hereunder, with respect to Obligations with respect to Revolving Facility owing by the other  Borrower hereunder, shall be separate and distinct obligations, but all such obligations shall be primary  obligations of each Borrower.  (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the  Administrative Agent and the Revolving Facility Lenders may proceed directly and at once, without  notice, against any Borrower to collect and recover the full amount, or any portion of, the Obligations  with respect to the Revolving Facility, without first proceeding against any other Borrower or any other  person, or against any security or collateral for the Obligations with respect to the Revolving Facility.   Each Borrower waives all suretyship defenses and consents and agrees that the Administrative Agent and  the Lenders shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Borrower or against or in  payment of any or all of the Obligations with respect to the Revolving Facility.

The  Administrative Agent and the Revolving Facility Lenders may rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,  on any certificate, report, information or any notice or communication made or given by the Borrower,  whether in its own name or on behalf of any Co-Borrower, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any  Revolving Facility Lender shall have any obligation to make any inquiry or request any confirmation from  or on behalf of any Co-Borrower as to the binding effect on it of any such notice or request.  ARTICLE II    The Credits  Section 2.01 Commitments.

Each Lender at its option may make any ABR Loan or SOFR Loan by causing any domestic or foreign  branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided, that any exercise of such option shall  not affect the obligation of the Borrower or any Co-Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with  the terms of this Agreement and such Lender shall not be entitled to any amounts payable under  Section 2.15 or 2.17 solely in respect of increased costs resulting from such exercise and existing at the  time of such exercise.    (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any SOFR Revolving  Facility Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the  Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum.  At the time that each ABR Revolving  Facility Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple  of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; provided, that an ABR Revolving  Facility Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused available balance  of the Revolving Facility Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an L/C  Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e).  Each Swingline Borrowing shall be in an amount  that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum.   </FONT></DIV>

Each Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to  acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and  unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment,  renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event  of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments or the fact that, as a result of changes in  currency exchange rates, such Revolving Facility Lender&#8217;s Revolving Facility Credit Exposure at any  time might exceed its Revolving Facility Commitment at such time (in which case Section 2.11(g)  would apply), and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or  reduction whatsoever.

(f) Obligations Absolute.  The obligation of the Borrower and each Co-Borrower  to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,  unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or  83  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft  or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any  respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the  applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that  does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance  whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this  Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower&#8217;s  or any Co-Borrower&#8217;s obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any  Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or  in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make  any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence),  or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or  other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to  make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising  from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank, or any of the circumstances referred to in clauses  (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence; provided, that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the  applicable Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower and each Co-Borrower to the extent of any direct  damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the  Borrower and each Co-Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower  and each Co-Borrower that are determined by final and binding decision of a court of competent  jurisdiction to have been caused by such Issuing Bank&#8217;s failure to exercise care when determining  whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.   The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the  part of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each  such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the  parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial  compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion,  either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation,  regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon  such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  (g) Disbursement Procedures.  The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly  following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment  under a Letter of Credit.  Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the  Borrower by written notice (including by electronic means) of any such demand for payment under a  Letter of Credit and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder;  provided, that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower or any  Co-Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Facility Lenders with  respect to any such L/C Disbursement.  (h) Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement, then,  unless the Borrower or any applicable Co-Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on  the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day  from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower  or any applicable Co-Borrower reimburses such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then  applicable to ABR Revolving Loans of the applicable Class; provided, that, if such L/C Disbursement  is not reimbursed by the Borrower or such Co-Borrower when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this  Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the  account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment  by any Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing  Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Facility Lender to the extent of such payment.  84  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (i) Replacement and Removal of an Issuing Bank.    (i) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written  agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the  successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such  replacement of an Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the  Borrower and each Co-Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced  Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12.  From and after the effective date of any such replacement,  (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank  under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references  herein to the term &#8220;Issuing Bank&#8221; shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous  Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.   After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party  hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this  Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement but shall not be  required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  (ii) An Issuing Bank may be removed at any time by written  agreement among the Borrower or any applicable Co-Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the  removed Issuing Bank.  At the time any such removal shall become effective, the Borrower shall  pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to  Section 2.12.  After the removal of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the removed Issuing Bank shall  remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank  under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such removal but shall  not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  (j) Cash Collateralization Following Certain Events.  If and when the Borrower  or any applicable Co-Borrower is required to Cash Collateralize any Revolving L/C Exposure relating  to any outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to any of Section 2.05(c), 2.11(e), 2.11(f), 2.11(g),  2.22(a)(v) or 7.01, the Borrower or such Co-Borrower shall deposit in an account with or at the direction  of the Collateral Agent, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an  amount in cash in Dollars equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of such date (or, in the case of  Sections 2.05(c), 2.11(e), 2.11(f), 2.11(g) and 2.22(a)(v), the portion thereof required by such sections).   Each deposit of Cash Collateral (x) made pursuant to this paragraph or (y) made by the Administrative  Agent pursuant to Section 2.22(a)(ii), in each case, shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral  for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower and each Co-Borrower under this  Agreement.  The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive  right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such  deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of (i) for so long as an Event  of Default shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent and (ii) at any other time, the Borrower, in each  case, in Permitted Investments and at the risk and expense of the Borrower, such deposits shall not bear  interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in  such account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for L/C  Disbursements for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied,  shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower and each Co- Borrower for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been  accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure representing greater  than 50% of the total Revolving L/C Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower  and each Co-Borrower under this Agreement.  If the Borrower or any Co-Borrower is required to  provide an amount of Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or  the existence of a Defaulting Lender or the occurrence of a limit under Section 2.11(e) or (f) being  85  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    exceeded, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower or such  Co-Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or the  termination of the Defaulting Lender status or the limits under Sections 2.11(e) and (f) no longer being  exceeded, as applicable.  (k) Cash Collateralization Following Termination of the Revolving Facilities.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of the prepayment in full of all outstanding  Revolving Facility Loans and the termination of all Revolving Facility Commitments (a &#8220;Revolving  Facility Termination Event&#8221;) in connection with which the Borrower notifies any one or more Issuing  Banks that it intends to maintain one or more Letters of Credit initially issued under this Agreement in  effect after the date of such Revolving Facility Termination Event (each, a &#8220;Continuing Letter of  Credit&#8221;), then the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral under the Security  Documents may be terminated in accordance with Section 9.18 if each such Continuing Letter of Credit  is Cash Collateralized in an amount equal to the Minimum L/C Collateral Amount, which shall be  deposited with or at the direction of each such Issuing Bank.   (l) Additional Issuing Banks.  From time to time, the Borrower may by notice to  the Administrative Agent designate any Lender (in addition to the initial Issuing Bank) each of which  agrees (in its sole discretion) to act in such capacity and is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative  Agent as an Issuing Bank.  Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart of this  Agreement upon the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld) and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes.  (m) Reporting.  Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each  Issuing Bank shall (i) provide to the Administrative Agent copies of any notice received from the  Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(b) no later than the next Business Day after receipt thereof and  (ii) report in writing to the Administrative Agent (A) on or prior to each Business Day on which such  Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance,  amendment or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended  or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension occurred  (and whether the amount thereof changed), and such Issuing Bank shall be permitted to issue, amend  or extend such Letter of Credit if the Administrative Agent shall not have advised such Issuing Bank  that such issuance, amendment or extension would not be in conformity with the requirements of this  Agreement, (B) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement, the  date of such L/C Disbursement and the amount of such L/C Disbursement and (C) on any other  Business Day, such other information with respect to the outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such  Issuing Bank as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.  Section 2.06 Funding of Borrowings.  (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made  by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon,  New York City Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such  purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04;  provided, further, that, with respect to all Alternate Currency Loans, Lenders shall make each Loan to be  made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 8:00  a.m. New York City Time.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower or  the applicable Co-Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of  the Borrower or the applicable Co-Borrower as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided,  that ABR Revolving Loans and Swingline Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of a L/C  Disbursement and reimbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative  Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">86  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender  prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the  Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume  that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with clause (a) of this  Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower or the applicable  Co-Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the  Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower or the  applicable Co-Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand  (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including  the date such amount is made available to the Borrower or the applicable Co-Borrower to but excluding  the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such  Lender, the greater of (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the  Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in  the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower or a Co-Borrower, the interest rate applicable to  ABR Loans at such time.  If the Borrower or a Co-Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to  the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall  promptly remit to the Borrower or the applicable Co-Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the  Borrower or such Co-Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative  Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any  payment by the Borrower or any Co-Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower or  such Co-Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the  Administrative Agent.  (c) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent, in its sole  discretion, may from its own funds make a Revolving Facility Loan on behalf of the Lenders (including  by means of Swingline Loans to the Borrower or a Co-Borrower).  In such event, the applicable Lenders  on behalf of whom the Administrative Agent made the Revolving Facility Loan shall reimburse the  Administrative Agent for all or any portion of such Revolving Facility Loan made on its behalf upon  written notice given to each applicable Lender not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the Business  Day such reimbursement is requested.  The entire amount of interest attributable to such Revolving  Facility Loan for the period from and including the date on which such Revolving Facility Loan was  made on such Lender&#8217;s behalf to but excluding the date the Administrative Agent is reimbursed in  respect of such Revolving Facility Loan by such Lender shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for  its own account.  Section 2.07 Interest Elections.  (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type  specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, shall have an initial  Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower or the applicable Co- Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in  the case of a SOFR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The  Borrower or the applicable Co-Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of  the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders  holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be  considered a separate Borrowing.  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower or the applicable  Co-Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election in writing, by the time that a  Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower or such Co-Borrower were  requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of  such election.  Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable.  87  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (c) Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in  compliance with Section 2.02:  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies  and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions  thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified  pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest  Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a  SOFR Borrowing; and  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a SOFR Borrowing, the Interest  Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period  contemplated by the definition of the term &#8220;Interest Period.&#8221;  If any such Interest Election Request requests a SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period,  then the Borrower or the applicable Co-Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of  one month&#8217;s duration.  If less than all the outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing shall be converted  or continued, then each resulting Borrowing shall be in an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and  not less than the Borrowing Minimum and satisfy the limitations specified in Section 2.02(c) regarding the  maximum number of Borrowings of the relevant Type.  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative  Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest Election Request relates of the details thereof  and of such Lender&#8217;s portion of each resulting Borrowing.  (e) If the Borrower or the applicable Co-Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest  Election Request with respect to a SOFR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable  thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period  such Borrowing shall be (x) converted to an ABR Borrowing and (y) in the case of any Borrowing of  any Alternate Currency Loans, converted to Dollar-denominated ABR Loans.  Notwithstanding any  contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative  Agent, at the written request (including a request through electronic means) of the Required Lenders,  so notifies the Borrower or the applicable Co-Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is  continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a SOFR Borrowing and  (ii) unless repaid, each SOFR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the  Interest Period applicable thereto.  Section 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments.  (a) Unless previously  terminated, the Revolving Facility Commitments of each Class shall terminate on the applicable Revolving  Facility Maturity Date for such Class.  On the Tenth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement  Effective Date, after giving effect to the funding of the 2021 Refinancing Term B-1 Loans, the 2021  Refinancing Term B-1 Loan Commitment (as defined in the Tenth Amended and Restated Credit  Agreement) of each Lender terminated.  (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the  Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class; provided, that (i) each reduction of the Revolving  Facility Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and  not less than $1,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Revolving Facility Commitments of  88  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    such Class) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments of  any Class if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Facility Loans in  accordance with Section 2.11 and any Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit in accordance with  Section 2.05(j) or (k), the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of such Class (excluding any Cash  Collateralized Letter of Credit) would exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class.   (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to  terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class under paragraph (b) of this  Section 2.08 at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction (or  such shorter period acceptable to the Administrative Agent), specifying such election and the effective  date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the  applicable Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this  Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable; provided, that a notice of termination or reduction of the Revolving  Facility Commitments of any Class delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned  upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures or similar agreements or other transactions,  in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on  or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction  of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be  made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.  Section 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a) The Borrower and each Co- Borrower hereby unconditionally promise to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each  Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Facility Loan to the  Borrower or any Co-Borrower on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date applicable to such Revolving  Facility Loans, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal  amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline Lender  the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan applicable to any Class of Revolving Facility  Commitments on the earlier of the Revolving Facility Maturity Date for such Class and the first date after  such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least five Business  Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided, that on each date that a Revolving Facility Borrowing  is made by the Borrower or any Co-Borrower, the Borrower or such Co-Borrower shall repay all Swingline  Loans then outstanding and the proceeds of any such Borrowing shall be applied by the Administrative  Agent to repay any Swingline Loans outstanding.  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or  accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Co-Borrower to such Lender resulting  from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid  to such Lender from time to time hereunder.  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record  (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Facility and Type thereof and the Interest Period (if  any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due  and payable from the Borrower or any Co-Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount  received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender&#8217;s share  thereof.  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of  this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded  therein; provided, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts  or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower or any Co-Borrower  to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  89  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory  note (a &#8220;Note&#8221;).  In such event, the Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver  to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such  Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and reasonably  acceptable to the Borrower.  Thereafter, unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable Lender, the Loans  evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment  pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the  payee named therein (or, if requested by such payee, to such payee and its registered assigns).  Section 2.10 Repayment of Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.  (a) Subject to  the other clauses of this Section 2.10 and to Section 9.08(e),   (i) the Borrower shall repay 2021 Refinancing Term B-1 Loans  incurred on the Tenth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement Effective Date on the  last day of each March, June, September and December of each year (commencing on the last day  of June 30, 2021) and on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date or, if any such date is not a  Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day (each such date being referred to as a &#8220;Term B- 1 Loan Installment Date&#8221;), in an aggregate principal amount of such Term B-1 Loans equal to (A)  in the case of quarterly payments due prior to the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date, an  amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such Term B-1 Loans outstanding  immediately after the Tenth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement Effective Date,  and (B) in the case of such payment due on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date, an amount  equal to the then unpaid principal amount of such Term B-1 Loans outstanding;  (ii) in the event that any Incremental Term Loans are made after the  Tenth Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement, the Borrower shall repay such  Incremental Term Loans on the dates and in the amounts set forth in the related Incremental  Assumption Agreement (each such date being referred to as an &#8220;Incremental Term Loan Installment  Date&#8221;); and  (iii) to the extent not previously paid, outstanding Term Loans shall be due and  payable on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date.  (b) To the extent not previously paid, outstanding Revolving Facility Loans shall  be due and payable on the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity Date.   (c) Prepayment of the Loans from:  (i) all Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 2.11(b) and Excess Cash Flow  pursuant to Section 2.11(c) shall be allocated to the Class or Classes of Term Loans determined  pursuant to Section 2.10(d), with the application thereof to reduce in direct order amounts due on  the succeeding Term Loan Installment Dates under such Classes as provided in the remaining  scheduled amortization payments under such Classes; and  (ii) any optional prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a)  shall be applied to the remaining installments of the Term Loans under the applicable Class or  Classes as the Borrower may in each case direct.  (d) Any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or  (c) shall be applied so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated among the Term B-1  Loans and the Other Term Loans, if any, pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of  outstanding Term B-1 Loans and Other Term Loans, if any.

Each repayment of a Borrowing (x) in the case of the Revolving Facility of  any Class, shall be applied to the Revolving Facility Loans included in the repaid Borrowing such that  each Revolving Facility Lender receives its ratable share of such repayment (based upon the respective  Revolving Facility Credit Exposures of the Revolving Facility Lenders of such Class at the time of such  repayment) and (y) in all other cases, shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid  Borrowing.  All repayments of Loans shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid  to the extent required by Section 2.13(d).  Section 2.11 Prepayment of Loans.  (a) The Borrower and the Co-Borrowers shall have  the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Loan in whole or in part, without premium or  penalty (but subject to Section 2.12(d) and Section 2.16), in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral  multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum or, if less, the amount  outstanding, subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 2.10(d).  Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary herein, any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) may be allocated  among the Term B-1 Loans and Other Term Loans, if any, at the option of the Borrower.  (b) The Borrower shall apply all Net Proceeds promptly upon receipt thereof to  prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of Section 2.10.  Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the Borrower may use a portion of such Net Proceeds to prepay or repurchase any Other  First Lien Debt, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (x) the amount of such Net  Proceeds and (y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such  Other First Lien Debt and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount  of such Other First Lien Debt and the outstanding principal amount of all Classes of Term Loans.    (c) Not later than five Business Days after the date on which the annual financial  statements are, or are required to be, delivered under Section 5.04(a) with respect to each Excess Cash  Flow Period, the Borrower shall calculate Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow Period and, if  and to the extent the amount of such Excess Cash Flow exceeds $1,000,000 (the &#8220;ECF Threshold  Amount&#8221;), the Borrower shall apply an amount equal to (i) the Required Percentage of such excess  portion of such Excess Cash Flow minus (ii) to the extent not financed using the proceeds of the  incurrence of funded term Indebtedness, the sum of (A) the amount of any voluntary payments during  such Excess Cash Flow Period (plus, without duplication of any amounts previously deducted under  this clause (A), the amount of any voluntary payments after the end of such Excess Cash Flow Period  but before the date of prepayment under this clause (c)) of (x) Term Loans (it being understood that the  amount of any such payment constituting a below-par Permitted Loan Purchase shall be calculated to  equal the amount of cash used and not the principal amount deemed prepaid therewith) and (y) Other  First Lien Debt (provided that in the case of the prepayment of any revolving Indebtedness, there was  a corresponding reduction in commitments; provided, further, that the maximum amount of each such  prepayment of Other First Lien Debt that may be counted for purposes of this clause (A)(y) shall not  exceed the amount that would have been prepaid in respect of such Other First Lien Debt if such  prepayment had been applied on a ratable basis among the Term Loans and such Other First Lien Debt  91  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (determined based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans and the aggregate  principal amount of such Other First Lien Debt on the date of such prepayment)) and (B) the amount  of any permanent voluntary reductions during such Excess Cash Flow Period (plus, without duplication  of any amounts previously deducted under this clause (B), the amount of any permanent voluntary  reductions after the end of such Excess Cash Flow Period but before the date of prepayment under this  clause (c)) of Revolving Facility Commitments to the extent that an equal amount of Revolving Facility  Loans was simultaneously repaid, (I) to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of  Section 2.10 or (II) to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of Section 2.10 and to  prepay any Other First Lien Debt in accordance with the agreement(s) governing such Other First Lien  Debt so long as the prepayments under this clause (II) are applied in a manner such that the Term Loans  are prepaid on at least a ratable basis (determined based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount  of Term Loans and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Other First Lien Debt being  prepaid under this clause (II) on the date of such prepayments).  Such calculation will be set forth in a  certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent setting  forth the amount, if any, of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year, the amount of any required  prepayment in respect thereof and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail.  (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.11 to the contrary, (i) to  the extent that any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Foreign Subsidiary or Excess Cash Flow  attributable to a Foreign Subsidiary would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to  Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) but is prohibited, restricted or delayed by applicable local law from  being repatriated to the United States of America, the portion of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash  Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in  Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) but may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long,  but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States of America,  and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under  the applicable local law, such repatriation will be effected and such repatriated Net Proceeds or Excess  Cash Flow will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result  thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c), to the extent  provided therein and (ii) to the extent that the Borrower has determined in good faith in consultation  with the Administrative Agent that repatriation of any or all of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow  that would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) would  have a material adverse tax cost consequence with respect to such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow,  the Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary  (the Borrower hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Subsidiary to promptly use commercially  reasonable efforts to take all actions within the reasonable control of the Borrower that are reasonably  required to eliminate such tax effects).  (e) In the event that the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Credit Exposure  of any Class exceeds the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class (other than as a result of  changes in currency exchange rates), the Borrower and the Co-Borrowers shall prepay Revolving  Facility Borrowings of such Class or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding,  provide Cash Collateral in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an  aggregate amount equal to such excess.  (f) In the event that the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit  Sublimit (other than as a result of changes in currency exchange rates), at the request of the  Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral pursuant to  Section 2.05(j) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.  92  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (g) If as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, on any Revaluation Date,  (i) the total Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any Class exceeds the total Revolving Facility  Commitments of such Class or (ii) the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit,   the Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, within 10 days of  such Revaluation Date (A) prepay Revolving Facility Borrowings of such Class or Swingline  Borrowings or (B) provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.05(j), in an aggregate amount such  that the applicable exposure does not exceed the applicable commitment sublimit or amount set forth  above.  Section 2.12 Fees.  (a) The Borrower and each Co-Borrower agrees to pay to each  Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the Administrative Agent, on the date that is the last  Business Day of March, June, September and December in each year and on the date on which the  Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a commitment  fee (a &#8220;Commitment Fee&#8221;) on the daily amount of the applicable Available Unused Commitment of such  Lender during the preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the  date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be terminated) at a rate equal to the  Applicable Commitment Fee.  All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number  of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.  For the purpose of calculating any Lender&#8217;s Commitment Fee, the  outstanding Swingline Loans during the period for which such Lender&#8217;s Commitment Fee is calculated  shall be deemed to be zero.  The Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence to accrue on the  Closing Date and shall cease to accrue on the date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender  shall be terminated as provided herein.  (b) The Borrower and each Co-Borrower from time to time agrees to pay (i) to  each Revolving Facility Lender of each Class (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the  Administrative Agent, on the date that is the last Business Day of March, June, September and  December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders  shall be terminated as provided herein, a fee in Dollars (an &#8220;L/C Participation Fee&#8221;) on such Lender&#8217;s  Revolving Facility Percentage of the daily aggregate Revolving L/C Exposure (excluding the portion  thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements) of such Class, during the preceding quarter  (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the Revolving Facility Maturity  Date or the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class shall be terminated) at  the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for SOFR Revolving Facility Borrowings of such  Class effective for each day in such period, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account (x) on the  date that is the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the  date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated, a fronting  fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from and including  the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the termination of such Letter of Credit,  computed at a rate equal to 1/8 of 1.00% per annum of the Dollar Equivalent of the daily stated amount  of such Letter of Credit, plus (y) in connection with the issuance, amendment or transfer of any such  Letter of Credit or any L/C Disbursement thereunder, such Issuing Bank&#8217;s customary documentary and  processing fees and charges (collectively, &#8220;Issuing Bank Fees&#8221;).  All L/C Participation Fees and Issuing  Bank Fees that are payable on a per annum basis shall be computed on the basis of the actual number  of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.  (c) The Borrower and each Co-Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative  Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent, the &#8220;First Lien Facilities Administration Fee&#8221; as  set forth in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter, as it may be amended, restated, supplemented or  otherwise modified from time to time, at the times specified therein (the &#8220;Administrative Agent Fees&#8221;).  93  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (d) In the event that, on or prior to the date that is six months after the Tenth  Incremental Assumption and Amendment Agreement Effective Date, the Borrower shall (x) make a  prepayment of the Term B-1 Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a) with the proceeds of any new or  replacement tranche of long-term secured term loans that are broadly syndicated to banks and other  institutional investors in financings similar to the Term B-1 Loans and have an All-in Yield that is less  than the All-in Yield of such Term B-1 Loans, or (y) effect any amendment to this Agreement which  reduces the All-in Yield of the Term B-1 Loans (other than, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y),  in connection with a Qualified IPO, a Change in Control or a transformative acquisition referred to in  the last sentence of this paragraph), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable  account of each of the applicable Lenders, (A) in the case of clause (x), a prepayment premium of  1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term B-1 Loans  so prepaid and (B) in the case of  clause (y), a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable Term B-1 Loans  for which the All-in Yield has been reduced pursuant to such amendment.  Such amounts shall be due  and payable on the date of such prepayment or the effective date of such amendment, as the case may  be.  For purposes of this Section 2.12(d), a &#8220;transformative acquisition&#8221; is any acquisition by the  Borrower or any Subsidiary that is (i) not permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents immediately  prior to the consummation of such acquisition or (ii) if permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents  immediately prior to the consummation of such acquisition, would not provide the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries with adequate flexibility under the Loan Documents for the continuation and/or expansion  of their combined operations following such consummation, as determined by the Borrower in good  faith.   (e) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the  Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders, except that Issuing  Bank Fees shall be paid directly to the applicable Issuing Banks.  Once paid, none of the Fees shall be  refundable under any circumstances.  Section 2.13 Interest.  (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each  Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the ABR plus the Applicable Margin.  (b) The Loans comprising each SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at Adjusted  Term SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or  any Fees or other amount payable by the Borrower or any Co-Borrower hereunder is not paid when  due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,  after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any  Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding clauses of  this Section 2.13 or (ii) in the case of any other overdue amount, 2.00% plus the rate applicable to ABR  Loans as provided in clause (a) of this Section; provided, that this clause (c) shall not apply to any  Event of Default that has been waived by the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.08.  (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) on each Interest  Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of Revolving Facility Loans, upon termination of the  applicable Revolving Facility Commitments and (iii) in the case of the Term Loans, on the applicable  Term Facility Maturity Date; provided, that (A) interest accrued pursuant to clause (c) of this  Section 2.13 shall be payable on demand, (B) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan  (other than a prepayment of a Revolving Facility Loan that is an ABR Loan that is not made in  conjunction with a permanent commitment reduction), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid  or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (C) in the event of any  </FONT></DIV>

(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days,  except that interest computed by reference to the ABR shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365  days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed  (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable ABR or Adjusted Term SOFR shall  be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest  error.  (f) In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, the  Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to make Conforming  Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan  Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without  any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  The  Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any  Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR.  Section 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest.    (a) Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Section 2.14, if on or  prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any SOFR Loan:  i. the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding  absent manifest error) that &#8220;Adjusted Term SOFR&#8221; cannot be determined pursuant to the  definition thereof; or  ii. the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a  SOFR Loan or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR  for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan does not  adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making and maintaining such Loan,  and the Required Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative  Agent;  then the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make  SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower and any Co-Borrower to continue SOFR Loans or to convert  ABR Loans to SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or affected  Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (b), at the instruction of the Required  Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower and any Co-Borrower may  revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent  of the affected SOFR Loans or affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower or the applicable Co- Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion  to ABR Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed  to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period.  Upon any such  conversion, the Borrower and the applicable Co-Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so  converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.16. If the Administrative  Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that  &#8220;Adjusted Term SOFR&#8221; cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the  95  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    interest rate on ABR Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause  (c) of the definition of &#8220;ABR&#8221; until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination.  (b)  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan  Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred  prior to any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in  accordance with clause (a) of the definition of &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221; for such Benchmark  Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder  and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings  without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other  Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the  definition of &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221; for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark  Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in  respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business  Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any  amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan  Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection  to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.  (ii) No swap agreement shall be deemed to be a &#8220;Loan Document&#8221; for purposes of this  Section 2.21.  (c) In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a  Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from  time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any  amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or  consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  (d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of  (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming  Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark  Replacement.  The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower of (x) the removal or reinstatement of  any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.14(e) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark  Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative  Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.14, including any  determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event,  circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be  conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without  consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as  expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.14.  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document,  at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then- current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for  such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time  to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor  for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information  announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative  Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous definition) for any  Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if  a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or  96  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer,  subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a  Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221;  (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such  previously removed tenor.  (f) Upon the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark  Unavailability Period, the Borrower and any Co-Borrower may revoke any pending request for a SOFR  Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any  Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower and such Co-Borrower will be deemed to  have converted any such request for a SOFR Loan into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR  Loans denominated in Dollars. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for  the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current  Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR.  (g) Furthermore, if any Loan in any Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of  the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, then (i) if  such SOFR Loan is denominated in Dollars, then on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such  Loan (or the next succeeding U.S. Government Securities Business Day if such day is not a U.S.  Government Securities Business Day), such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and  shall constitute an ABR Loan on such day or (ii) if such Loan is denominated in any Agreed Currency  (other than Dollars), then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or  the next succeeding U.S. Government Securities Business Day if such day is not a U.S. Government  Securities Business Day), at the Borrower&#8217;s election prior to such day; (A) be prepaid by the Borrower on  such day or (B) be exchanged for an equivalent amount of Dollars and be converted by the Administrative  Agent to, and (subject to the remainder of this subclause (B)) shall constitute, an ABR Loan on such day  (it being understood and agreed that if the Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12:00  noon New York City time the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such exchange and conversion  of such Loan into an ABR Loan), and, in the case of such subclause (B), upon any subsequent  implementation of a Benchmark Replacement in respect of such Agreed Currency pursuant to this Section  2.14, such ABR Loan shall then be exchanged for an equivalent amount of such Agreed Currency and  converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, a Loan denominated in such original Agreed  Currency on the day of such implementation, giving effect to such Benchmark Replacement in respect of  such Agreed Currency.  Section 2.15 Increased Costs.  (a) If any Change in Law shall:  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or  similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any  Lender or Issuing Bank; or   (ii) subject any Lender to any Tax with respect to any Loan Document  (other than (i) Taxes indemnifiable under Section 2.17 or (ii) Excluded Taxes); or   (iii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank any other condition  affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or  participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining  any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such  Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the  97  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal,  interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such  additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such  additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding  capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such  Lender&#8217;s or Issuing Bank&#8217;s capital or on the capital of such Lender&#8217;s or Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding  company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters  of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank,  to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s  holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such  Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s policies and the policies of such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s  holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower  shall pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as  will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s holding  company for any such reduction suffered.  (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or  amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as applicable,  as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive  absent manifest error; provided, that any such certificate claiming amounts described in clause (x) or  (y) of the definition of &#8220;Change in Law&#8221; shall, in addition, state the basis upon which such amount has  been calculated and certify that such Lender&#8217;s or Issuing Bank&#8217;s demand for payment of such costs  hereunder, and such method of allocation is not inconsistent with its treatment of other borrowers  which, as a credit matter, are similarly situated to the Borrower and which are subject to similar  provisions.  The Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable,  the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  (d) Promptly after any Lender or any Issuing Bank has determined that it will  make a request for increased compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15, such Lender or Issuing Bank  shall notify the Borrower thereof.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand  compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s or Issuing  Bank&#8217;s right to demand such compensation; provided, that the Borrower shall not be required to  compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs or  reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable,  notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of  such Lender&#8217;s or Issuing Bank&#8217;s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the  Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period  referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  Section 2.16 Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal  of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result  of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest  Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow (other than due to the default of the relevant Lender),  convert, continue or prepay any SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto  or (d) the assignment of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto  as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower and  the Co-Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In  the case of a SOFR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be the amount  determined by such Lender (it being understood that the deemed amount shall not exceed the actual amount)  </FONT></DIV>

(a) Any and all payments made by or on behalf of a Loan Party  under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction  or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes; provided, that if a Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or  any other applicable withholding agent shall be required by applicable Requirement of Law to deduct or  withhold any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the applicable withholding agent shall make such  deductions or withholdings as are reasonably determined by the applicable withholding agent to be required  by any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full  amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority within the time allowed and in  accordance with applicable Requirement of Law, and (iii) to the extent withholding or deduction is required  to be made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Loan Party shall be  increased as necessary so that after all required deductions and withholdings have been made (including  deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) the  Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.  Whenever any Indemnified Taxes or Other  Taxes are payable by a Loan Party, as promptly as possible thereafter, such Loan Party shall send to the  Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of a Lender, as the case may be, a certified  copy of an official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, acting  reasonably) received by the Loan Party showing payment thereof.  Without duplication, after any payment  of Taxes by any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this  Section 2.17, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account  of a Lender, as the case may be, or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may  be, a copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any  return required by applicable Requirements of Law to report such payment or other evidence of such  payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (b) The Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes.  (c) The Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the  Administrative Agent and each Lender within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the  full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or such  Lender, as applicable, as the case may be (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or  asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17), and any reasonable expenses  arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were  correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate setting  forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered  to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent (as applicable) on its own behalf or on  behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  99  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (d) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at  such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly  completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and such other reasonably  requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to  determine (A) whether or not any payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are  subject to withholding of Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and  (C) such Lender&#8217;s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, any such withholding  of Taxes in respect of any payments to be made to such Lender by any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan  Document or otherwise to establish such Lender&#8217;s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable  jurisdiction.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall  deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower  or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine  whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.17(d), each Foreign Lender with  respect to any Loan made to the Borrower shall, to the extent it is legally eligible to do so:  (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, prior to the  date on which the first payment to the Foreign Lender is due hereunder, two copies of (A) in the  case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under  Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of &#8220;portfolio interest,&#8221; United States  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any applicable successor  form) (together with a certificate (substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto, such certificate, the  &#8220;Non-Bank Tax Certificate&#8221;) certifying that such Foreign Lender is not a bank for purposes of  Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a &#8220;10-percent shareholder&#8221; (within the meaning of  Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a CFC related to the Borrower (within  the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code), and that the interest payments in question are not  effectively connected with the conduct by such Lender of a trade or business within the United  States of America), (B) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or  Form W-8ECI (or any applicable successor form), in each case properly completed and duly  executed by such Foreign Lender claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S.  federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement, (C) Internal Revenue  Service Form W-8IMY (or any applicable successor form) and all necessary attachments (including  the forms described in clauses (A) and (B) above, provided that if the Foreign Lender is a  partnership, and one or more of the partners is claiming portfolio interest treatment, the Non-Bank  Tax Certificate may be provided by such Foreign Lender on behalf of such partners) or (D) any  other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in  United States federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary  documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and  (ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further  copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor form) on or before the date  that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of  any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower  and the Administrative Agent, and from time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  Any Foreign Lender that becomes legally ineligible to update any form or  certification previously delivered shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in  writing of such Foreign Lender&#8217;s inability to do so.  100  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    Each person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 9.04 or a Lender  pursuant to Section 9.04 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all the  forms and statements required pursuant to this Section 2.17(e); provided that a Participant shall furnish all  such required forms and statements to the person from which the related participation shall have been  purchased.  In addition, each Agent shall deliver to the Borrower (x)(I) prior to the date on  which the first payment by the Borrower is due hereunder or (II) prior to the first date on or after the date  on which such Agent becomes a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.09 on which  payment by the Borrower is due hereunder, as applicable, two copies of a properly completed and executed  IRS Form W-9 certifying its exemption from U.S. federal backup withholding or such other properly  completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law certifying its entitlement to an  available exemption from applicable U.S. federal withholding taxes in respect of any payments to be made  to such Agent by any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document including, as applicable, an IRS Form  W-8IMY certifying that the Agent is a U.S. branch and intends to be treated as a U.S. person for purposes  of withholding under Chapter 3 of the Code pursuant to Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) of the Treasury  Regulations, and (y) on or before the date on which any such previously delivered documentation expires  or becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent  documentation previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and from time to time if reasonably requested  by the Borrower, two further copies of such documentation.  (f) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, determines, in its  sole discretion, that it has received a refund of an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax for which a payment  has been made by a Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, which refund  in the good faith judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is  attributable to such payment made by such Loan Party, then the Lender or the Administrative Agent,  as the case may be, shall reimburse the Loan Party for such amount (net of all reasonable out-of-pocket  expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other  than any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such  refund) as the Lender or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines in its sole discretion to  be the proportion of the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position  (taking into account expenses or any Taxes imposed on the refund) than it would have been in if the  Indemnified Tax or Other Tax giving rise to such refund had not been imposed in the first instance;  provided that the Loan Party, upon the request of the Lender or the Administrative Agent agrees to  repay the amount paid over to the Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by  the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event the Lender  or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  In such  event, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrower&#8217;s request,  provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to  repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority (provided that such Lender or  the Administrative Agent may delete any information therein that it deems confidential).  A Lender or  the Administrative Agent shall claim any refund that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes  in its sole discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim.  No Lender nor the  Administrative Agent shall be obliged to make available its tax returns (or any other information  relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party in connection with this clause (f) or  any other provision of this Section 2.17.  (g) If the Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists for contesting an  Indemnified Tax or Other Tax for which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts or indemnification  payments, each affected Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate  with the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request in challenging such Tax.  The Borrower  101  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    and the Co-Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Lender and Agent harmless against any out-of- pocket expenses incurred by such person in connection with any request made by the Borrower pursuant  to this Section 2.17(g).  Nothing in this Section 2.17(g) shall obligate any Lender or Agent to take any  action that such person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in a material detriment to such  person.  (h) Each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent  two Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 (or substitute or successor form), properly completed and  duly executed, certifying that such U.S. Lender is exempt from United States federal backup  withholding (i) on or prior to the Closing Date (or on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this  Agreement), (ii) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, (iii) after  the occurrence of a change in the U.S. Lender&#8217;s circumstances requiring a change in the most recent  form previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and (iv) from time to  time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  (i) If a payment made to any Lender or any Agent under this Agreement or any  other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such  Lender or such Agent were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA  (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or  such Agent shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed  by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent  such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by  Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has or has  not complied with such Lender&#8217;s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to  deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(i), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall  include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.  (j) The agreements in this Section 2.17 shall survive the termination of this  Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable under any Loan Document.  For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; includes any Issuing Bank and the  terms &#8220;applicable law&#8221; and &#8220;applicable Requirement of Law&#8221; include FATCA.  Section 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.  (a) Unless  otherwise specified, the Borrower and each Co-Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by  it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts  payable under Sections 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to (x) with respect to all payments made in  Dollars, 2:00 p.m., New York City Time, (y) with respect to all payments made in Alternate Currencies  (other than Canadian Dollars), 8:00 a.m., New York City Time and (z) with respect to all payments made  in Canadian Dollars, 1:00 p.m., New York City Time, in each case, on the date when due, in immediately  available funds.  Each such payment shall be made without condition or deduction for any defense,  recoupment, set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the  discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business  Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative  Agent to the applicable account designated to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent, except payments  to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein  and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the persons  entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account  of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">102  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    expressly provided herein, if any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the  date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment  accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments made  under the Loan Documents shall be made in Dollars (or in the case of Alternate Currency Loans or Alternate  Currency Letters of Credit, in the applicable Alternate Currency).  Any payment required to be made by  the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the  Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment  in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the  Administrative Agent to make such payment.  (b) Subject to Section 7.02, if at any time insufficient funds are received by and  available to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or the Co-Borrowers to pay fully all amounts  of principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees then due from the Borrower and the  Co-Borrowers hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then  due from the Borrower and the Co-Borrowers hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in  accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, (ii) second, towards payment  of principal of Swingline Loans and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due from the Borrower and  the Co-Borrowers hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts  of principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to such parties, and (iii) third, towards  payment of principal then due from the Borrower and the Co-Borrowers hereunder, ratably among the  parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or  otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of, or interest on, any of its Term Loans,  Revolving Facility Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements of a given Class or Swingline Loans  resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term  Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements of such Class and Swingline  Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender entitled to receive  the same proportion of such payment, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase  participations in the Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements of  such Class and Swingline Loans of such other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all  such payments shall be shared by all such Lenders ratably in accordance with the principal amount of  each such Lender&#8217;s respective Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C  Disbursements of such Class and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon; provided, that (i) if  any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is  recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such  recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this clause (c) shall not be construed to apply to  any payment made by the Borrower or any Co-Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express  terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of  or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements to any assignee or  participant.  The Borrower and the Co-Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it  may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the  foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower or the Co-Borrower rights of set-off and  counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the  Borrower or such Co-Borrower in the amount of such participation.  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower  prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders  or the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower or the Co-Borrower will not make such  payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or the Co-Borrower has made such  payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to  103  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount due.  In such event, if the  Borrower or the Co-Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the  applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith  on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day  from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the  Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the  Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant  to Section 2.04(b), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06 or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion  (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the  Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender&#8217;s obligations under such  Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.  Section 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) If any Lender  requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower or the Co-Borrower is required to pay any  additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to  Section 2.17 or any event that gives rise to the operation of Section 2.20, then such Lender shall use  reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to  assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the  reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts  payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17 or mitigate the applicability of Section 2.20, as applicable, in the  future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not  otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect.  The Borrower and the Co-Borrower  hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such  designation or assignment.  (b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or gives notice  under Section 2.20, (ii) the Borrower or the Co-Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to  any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or  (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon  notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require any such Lender to assign and delegate,  without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its  interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations  (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the  Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if in respect  of any Revolving Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and the  Issuing Bank), to the extent consent would be required under Section 9.04(b) for an assignment of  Loans or Commitments, as applicable, which consent, in each case, shall not unreasonably be withheld,  (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its  Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued  fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding  principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower or the Co-Borrower (in the case of all other  amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under  Section 2.15, payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17 or a notice given under Section  2.20, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  Nothing in this  Section 2.19 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender  that is a Defaulting Lender.  No action by or consent of the removed Lender shall be necessary in  connection with such assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon  payment of such purchase price.  In connection with any such assignment the Borrower, Administrative  Agent, such removed Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04,  104  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    provided, that if such removed Lender does not comply with Section 9.04 within one Business Day  after the Borrower&#8217;s request, compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be required to effect such  assignment.  (c) If any Lender (such Lender, a &#8220;Non-Consenting Lender&#8221;) has failed to consent  to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08  requires the consent of all of the Lenders affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall  have granted their consent, then the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting Lender  grants such consent) at its sole expense (including with respect to the processing and recordation fee  referred to in Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non- Consenting Lender to (and any such Non-Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Borrower&#8217;s  request) assign its Loans and its Commitments (or, at the Borrower&#8217;s option, the Loans and  Commitments under the Facility that is the subject of the proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or  termination) hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably acceptable to (i) the Administrative Agent  (unless such assignee is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund) and (ii) if in respect  of any Revolving Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan, the Swingline Lender and the  Issuing Banks; provided, that: (a) all Loan Obligations of the Borrower and the Co-Borrower owing to  such Non-Consenting Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender  concurrently with such assignment, (b) the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying  to such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid  interest thereon and the replacement Lender or, at the option of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay  any amount required by Section 2.12(d)(y), if applicable, and (c) the replacement Lender shall grant its  consent with respect to the applicable proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination.  No  action by or consent of the Non-Consenting Lender shall be necessary in connection with such  assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon payment of such purchase  price.  In connection with any such assignment the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non- Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04; provided,  that if such Non-Consenting Lender does not comply with Section 9.04 within one Business Day after  the Borrower&#8217;s request, compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be required to effect such assignment.  Section 2.20 Illegality.  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law  has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is  unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make or maintain any SOFR Loans, then, on  notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligations of such  Lender to make or continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Borrowings to SOFR Borrowings shall be  suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances  giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall upon  demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), convert all SOFR Borrowings  (including any Alternate Currency Loans) of such Lender to Dollar-denominated ABR Borrowings, either  on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR  Borrowings to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans.   Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall also pay accrued  interest on the amount so converted.  Section 2.21 Incremental Commitments.  (a) The Borrower may, by written notice to  the Administrative Agent from time to time, request Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or  Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as applicable, in an amount not to exceed the Incremental  Amount available at the time such Incremental Commitments are established (or, at the option of the  Borrower, at the time of incurrence of the Incremental Loans thereunder) from one or more Incremental  Term Lenders and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders (which may include any existing Lender)  willing to provide such Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as  105  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    the case may be, in their own discretion; provided, that each Incremental Revolving Facility Lender  providing a commitment to make revolving loans shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative  Agent and, to the extent the same would be required for an assignment under Section 9.04, the Issuing  Banks and the Swingline Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless such  Incremental Revolving Facility Lender is a Revolving Facility Lender.

Any amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan  Document that is necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.21 and any such collateral and other  107  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    documentation shall be deemed &#8220;Loan Documents&#8221; hereunder and may be memorialized in writing by the  Administrative Agent with the Borrower&#8217;s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the  other parties hereto.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment or  Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment shall become effective under this Section 2.21 unless  (i) on the date of such effectiveness, (A) to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption  Agreement, the conditions set forth in clause (c) of Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the  Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a  Responsible Officer of the Borrower and (B) if such Incremental Term Loan Commitment or  Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment is established for a purpose other than financing any  Permitted Business Acquisition or any other acquisition that is permitted by this Agreement, no Event  of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing or would result  therefrom and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received customary legal opinions, board  resolutions and other customary closing certificates and documentation as required by the relevant  Incremental Assumption Agreement and, to the extent required by the Administrative Agent, consistent  with those delivered on the Closing Date pursuant to the First Incremental Assumption and Amendment  Agreement and such additional customary documents and filings (including amendments to the  Mortgages and other Security Documents and title endorsement bringdowns) as the Administrative  Agent may reasonably request to assure that the Incremental Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility  Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are secured by the Collateral ratably  with (or, to the extent set forth in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, junior to) one or  more Classes of then-existing Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.  (d) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may  take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that (i) all Incremental Term Loans  (other than Other Term Loans of a different Class), when originally made, are included in each  Borrowing of the outstanding applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and (ii) all Revolving  Facility Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments (other than Revolving  Facility Loans of a different Class), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the  applicable Class of outstanding Revolving Facility Loans on a pro rata basis.  The Borrower agrees that  Section 2.16 shall apply to any conversion of SOFR Loans to ABR Loans reasonably required by the  Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including  Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (e) through (i) of this Section 2.21),  pursuant to one or more offers made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders of any Class of  Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitments, on a pro rata basis (based, in the case of an offer  to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, on the aggregate outstanding Term Loans of such Class  and, in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, on the aggregate outstanding  Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility, as applicable) and on the same terms  (&#8220;Pro Rata Extension Offers&#8221;), the Borrower is hereby permitted to consummate transactions with  individual Lenders from time to time to extend the maturity date of such Lender&#8217;s Loans and/or  Commitments of such Class and to otherwise modify the terms of such Lender&#8217;s Loans and/or  Commitments of such Class pursuant to the terms of the relevant Pro Rata Extension Offer (including,  without limitation, increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Lender&#8217;s Loans and/or  Commitments and/or modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such Lender&#8217;s Loans).  For the  avoidance of doubt, the reference to &#8220;on the same terms&#8221; in the preceding sentence shall mean, (i) in  the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, that all of the Term Loans of such  Class are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees  payable with respect to such extension are the same and (ii) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under  108  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    any Revolving Facility, that all of the Revolving Facility Commitments of such Facility are offered to  be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect  to such extension are the same.  Any such extension (an &#8220;Extension&#8221;) agreed to between the Borrower  and any such Lender (an &#8220;Extending Lender&#8221;) will be established under this Agreement by  implementing an Incremental Term Loan for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Term  Loan (such extended Term Loan, an &#8220;Extended Term Loan&#8221;) or an Incremental Revolving Facility  Commitment for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Revolving Facility Commitment  (such extended Revolving Facility Commitment, an &#8220;Extended Revolving Facility Commitment&#8221; and  the loans thereunder, &#8220;Extended Revolving Loans&#8221;).  Each Pro Rata Extension Offer shall specify the  date on which the Borrower proposes that the Extended Term Loan shall be made, which shall be a date  not earlier than five Business Days after the date on which notice is delivered to the Administrative  Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion).   (f) The Borrower, each applicable Co-Borrower and each Extending Lender shall  execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other  documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Extended Term  Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments of such Extending Lender.  Each Incremental  Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable Extended Term Loans and/or Extended  Revolving Facility Commitments; provided, that (i) except as to interest rates, fees and any other  pricing terms (which interest rates, fees and other pricing terms shall not be subject to the provisions  set forth in Section 2.21(b)(vii)), and amortization, final maturity date and participation in prepayments  and commitment reductions (which shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this proviso, be determined  by the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), the Extended Term Loans shall have  (x) the same terms as an existing Class of Term Loans or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) the final maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall  be no earlier than the latest Term Facility Maturity Date in effect on the date of incurrence, (iii) the  Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining  Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Class of Term Loans to which such offer relates, (iv) except  as to interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms, participation in mandatory prepayments and  commitment reductions and final maturity (which shall be determined by the Borrower and set forth in  the Pro Rata Extension Offer), any Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall have (x) the same  terms as an existing Class of Revolving Facility Commitments or (y) have such other terms as shall be  reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and, in respect of any other terms that would affect  the rights or duties of any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, such terms as shall be reasonably  satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, (v) any Extended Revolving Facility  Commitments may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro  rata basis) than the 2021 Revolving Loans in any voluntary or mandatory prepayment or commitment  reduction hereunder and (vi) any Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less  than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) than the Term B-1 Loans in any mandatory  prepayment hereunder.  Upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this  Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and  terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments evidenced  thereby as provided for in Section 9.08(e).  Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in  writing by the Administrative Agent with the Borrower&#8217;s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld)  and furnished to the other parties hereto.  If provided in any Incremental Assumption Agreement with  respect to any Extended Revolving Facility Commitments, and with the consent of each Swingline  Lender and Issuing Bank, participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit shall be reallocated  to lenders holding such Extended Revolving Facility Commitments in the manner specified in such  Incremental Assumption Agreement, including upon effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Facility  Commitment or upon or prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving Facility Commitments.  109  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (g) Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable Extending  Lender&#8217;s Term Loan will be automatically designated an Extended Term Loan and/or such Extending  Lender&#8217;s Revolving Facility Commitment will be automatically designated an Extended Revolving  Facility Commitment.  For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if such  Extending Lender is extending a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an  Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Extended Term Loan and (ii) if such Extending  Lender is extending a Revolving Facility Commitment, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have  an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of such Extended Revolving Facility  Commitment.  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any  other Loan Document (including, without limitation, this Section 2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of  Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Facility Commitments will not be included in the  calculation of the Incremental Amount, (ii) no Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility  Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, (iii) any Extending  Lender may extend all or any portion of its Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitment  pursuant to one or more Pro Rata Extension Offers (subject to applicable proration in the case of over  participation) (including the extension of any Extended Term Loan and/or Extended Revolving Facility  Commitment), (iv) there shall be no condition to any Extension of any Loan or Commitment at any  time or from time to time other than notice to the Administrative Agent of such Extension and the terms  of the Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment implemented thereby, (v) all  Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof  shall be Loan Obligations of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all other Obligations relating  to an existing Class of Term Loans of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other  Loan Documents, (vi) no Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender shall be obligated to provide Swingline  Loans or issue Letters of Credit under such Extended Revolving Facility Commitments unless it shall  have consented thereto and (vii) there shall be no obligor in respect of any such Extended Term Loans  or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments that is not a Loan Party.   (i) Each Extension shall be consummated pursuant to procedures set forth in the  associated Pro Rata Extension Offer; provided, that the Borrower shall cooperate with the  Administrative Agent prior to making any Pro Rata Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures  with respect to mechanical provisions relating to such Extension, including, without limitation, timing,  rounding and other adjustments.  (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including  Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (j) through (o) of this Section 2.21),  the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional  tranches of term loans under this Agreement (such loans, &#8220;Refinancing Term Loans&#8221;), the net cash  proceeds of which are used to Refinance in whole or in part any Class of Term Loans.  Each such notice  shall specify the date (each, a &#8220;Refinancing Effective Date&#8221;) on which the Borrower proposes that the  Refinancing Term Loans shall be made, which shall be a date not earlier than five Business Days after  the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed  to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided, that:  (i) before and after giving effect to the borrowing of such Refinancing Term  Loans on the Refinancing Effective Date each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be  satisfied to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such  Refinancing Term Loans;  </FONT></DIV>

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including  Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (l) through (o) of this Section 2.21),  the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional  Facilities providing for revolving commitments (&#8220;Replacement Revolving Facilities&#8221; and the  commitments thereunder, &#8220;Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments&#8221; and the revolving loans  thereunder, &#8220;Replacement Revolving Loans&#8221;), which replace in whole or in part any Class of Revolving  Facility Commitments under this Agreement.  Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a  &#8220;Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date&#8221;) on which the Borrower proposes that the  Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall become effective, which shall be a date not less  than five Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent  (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided  that: (i) before and after giving effect to the establishment of such Replacement Revolving Facility  Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, each of the conditions set forth  in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption  Agreement governing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; (ii) after giving effect to  the establishment of any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and any concurrent reduction  in the aggregate amount of any other Revolving Facility Commitments, the aggregate amount of  Revolving Facility Commitments shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Facility  Commitments outstanding immediately prior to the applicable Replacement Revolving Facility  Effective Date; (iii) no Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall have a final maturity date  (or require commitment reductions or amortizations) prior to the Revolving Facility Maturity Date in  effect at the time of incurrence for the Revolving Facility Commitments being replaced; (iv) all other  terms applicable to such Replacement Revolving Facility (other than provisions relating to (x) fees,  interest rates and other pricing terms and prepayment and commitment reduction and optional  redemption terms which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such  Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and (y) the amount of any letter of credit sublimit and  swingline commitment under such Replacement Revolving Facility, which shall be as agreed between  the Borrower, the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments, the  Administrative Agent and the replacement issuing bank and replacement swingline lender, if any, under  such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to,  or not materially less favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a whole,  applicable to the 2021 Revolving Loans (except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply  solely to any period after the latest Revolving Facility Maturity Date in effect at the time of incurrence);  112  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    and (v) there shall be no obligor in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility that is not a Loan  Party.  In addition, the Borrower may establish Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments to  refinance and/or replace all or any portion of a Term Loan hereunder (regardless of whether such Term  Loan is repaid with the proceeds of Replacement Revolving Loans or otherwise), so long as the  aggregate amount of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments does not exceed the aggregate  amount of Term Loans repaid at the time of establishment thereof (it being understood that such  Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment may be provided by the Lenders holding the Term Loans  being repaid and/or by any other person that would be a permitted Assignee hereunder) so long as  (i) before and after giving effect to the establishment such Replacement Revolving Facility  Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date each of the conditions set forth in  Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent required by the relevant agreement governing such  Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments, (ii) the remaining life to termination of such  Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to  Maturity then applicable to the refinanced Term Loans, (iii) the final termination date of the  Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall be no earlier than the Term Facility Maturity Date  of the refinanced Term Loans, (iv) with respect to Replacement Revolving Loans secured by Liens on  Collateral that rank junior in right of security to the 2021 Revolving Loans, such Liens will be subject  to a Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement and (v) the requirement of clause (v) in the preceding  sentence shall be satisfied mutatis mutandis.  Solely to the extent that an Issuing Bank or Swingline  Lender is not a replacement issuing bank or replacement swingline lender, as the case may be, under a  Replacement Revolving Facility, it is understood and agreed that such Issuing Bank or Swingline  Lender shall not be required to issue any letters of credit or swingline loans under such Replacement  Revolving Facility and, to the extent it is necessary for such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender to  withdraw as an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, at the time of the establishment  of such Replacement Revolving Facility, such withdrawal shall be on terms and conditions reasonably  satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, in its sole discretion.  The  Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, in full upon  demand, for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket cost or expense attributable to such  withdrawal.  (m) The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other person that would be a  permitted Assignee of a Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a  portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; provided that any Lender offered or  approached to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments may elect  or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment.

Subject to the terms of any applicable  Intercreditor Agreement, any amount received by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent from  any Loan Party (or from proceeds of any Collateral) following any acceleration of the Obligations under  this Agreement or any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower under Section 7.01(h) or (i), in each  case that is continuing, shall be applied: (i) first, ratably, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense  reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent from the Borrower (other  than in connection with any Secured Cash Management Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement),  (ii) second, towards payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the  parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties,  (iii) third, towards payment of principal of Swingline Loans and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due  from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of  principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to such parties, (iv) fourth, towards payment of  other Obligations (including Obligations of the Loan Parties owing under or in respect of any Secured Cash  Management Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement) then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably  among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of such Obligations then due to such  parties and (v) last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrower  or as otherwise required by Requirements of Law.

If, after giving effect to the adjustments in this Section 7.03, the  Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the Financial Covenant, the Borrower shall  be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Financial Covenant as of the relevant date of  determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date,  and the applicable breach or default of the Financial Covenant that had occurred shall be deemed cured for  the purposes of this Agreement.  ARTICLE VIII    The Agents  Section 8.01 Appointment.  (a) Each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and the  Swingline Lender (if applicable) and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to  Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements), each Issuing Bank (in such  capacities and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Secured Cash Management  Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements) and, to the extent a Lender is unable to act on behalf of its  Affiliates, each other Secured Party (for all purposes of this Article VIII and Article IX, by virtue of its  acceptance of the benefits of the Loan Documents) hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the  Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  including as the Collateral Agent for such Lender and the other Secured Parties under the Security  Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to  take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to  exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by  the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are  reasonably incidental thereto.  In addition, to the extent required under the laws of any jurisdiction other  than the United States of America, each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby grants to the  Administrative Agent any required powers of attorney to execute any Security Document governed by the  laws of such jurisdiction on such Lender&#8217;s or Issuing Bank&#8217;s behalf.  Notwithstanding any provision to the  contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or  responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and  no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this  Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.  164  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (b) In furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and  the Swingline Lender (if applicable) and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties  to Secured Cash Management Agreements or Secured Hedge Agreements), each Issuing Bank (in such  capacities and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Secured Cash  Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements) and, to the extent a Lender is unable to act  on behalf of its Affiliates, each other Secured Party hereby appoints and authorizes the Collateral Agent  to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens  on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such  powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.  In this connection, the Collateral Agent  (and any Subagents appointed by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 for purposes of holding  or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents,  or for exercising any rights or remedies thereunder at the direction of the Collateral Agent) shall be  entitled to the benefits of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, Section 8.07) as though the  Collateral Agent (and any such Subagents) were an &#8220;Agent&#8221; under the Loan Documents, as if set forth  in full herein with respect thereto.  Section 8.02 Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent  may execute any of their respective duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including  for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) by or through  agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact) and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or  experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence  or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.  Each Agent may also  from time to time, when it deems it to be necessary or desirable, appoint one or more trustees, co-trustees,  collateral co-agents, collateral subagents or attorneys-in-fact (each, a &#8220;Subagent&#8221;) with respect to all or any  part of the Collateral; provided, that no such Subagent shall be authorized to take any action with respect  to any Collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by the Administrative  Agent or the Collateral Agent.  Should any instrument in writing from the Borrower or any other Loan Party  be required by any Subagent so appointed by an Agent to more fully or certainly vest in and confirm to  such Subagent such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party  to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by such Agent.   If any Subagent, or successor thereto, shall become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all rights,  powers, privileges and duties of such Subagent, to the extent permitted by law, shall automatically vest in  and be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent until the appointment of a new  Subagent.  No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, attorney-in-fact  or Subagent that it selects with reasonable care.  Section 8.03 Exculpatory Provisions.  None of the Agents, or their respective Affiliates  or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be  (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or in connection  with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found  by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such  person&#8217;s own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders  for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof  contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other  document referred to or provided for in, or received by any Agent under or in connection with, this  Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability  or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party  thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent shall be under any obligation to any  Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained  in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or  records of any Loan Party.  No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth  165  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent  shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default  has occurred and is continuing, and (b) no Agent shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other  Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information  relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by such Agent or any  of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Agents shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or  Event of Default unless and until written notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the  Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or an Issuing Bank.  No Agent shall be responsible for or  have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in  connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or  other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the  performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein  or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability,  effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement,  instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the  Security Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction of any  condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly  required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  Section 8.04 Reliance by Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall  not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument,  document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other  distribution) or conversation believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise  authenticated by the proper person.  Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by  telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for  relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to any Credit Event, that by its  terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or any Issuing Bank, each Agent may presume that  such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless such Agent shall have received notice  to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to such Credit Event.  Each Agent may consult with  legal counsel (including counsel to Holdings or the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts  selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice  of any such counsel, accountants or experts.  Each Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the  Register with respect to any amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written  notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent.  Each Agent  shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan  Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified  by this Agreement, all or other Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its  satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of  taking or continuing to take any such action.  Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or  in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request  of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders), and such request and  any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders  of the Loans.  Section 8.05 Notice of Default.  Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or  notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless such Agent has received written notice  from a Lender, Holdings or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of  Default and stating that such notice is a &#8220;notice of default.&#8221;  In the event that the Administrative Agent  receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.  The  Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be  reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders);  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">166  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    provided, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the  Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such  action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of  the Lenders.  Section 8.06 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.  Each Lender and Issuing  Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors,  employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that  no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of  a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender.   Each Lender and Issuing Bank represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon  any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,  made its own appraisal of, and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other  condition and creditworthiness of, the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make  its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently  and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information  as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions  in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such  investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and  other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates.  Except for notices, reports and  other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder,  the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or  other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise),  prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the  possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in- fact or affiliates.  Section 8.07 Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent and the  Revolving Facility Lenders agree to indemnify each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender, in each case,  in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by Holdings or the Borrower and without limiting the  obligation of Holdings or the Borrower to do so), in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its aggregate  Revolving Facility Credit Exposure and, in the case of the indemnification of each Agent, outstanding Term  Loans and unused Commitments hereunder; provided, that the aggregate principal amount of Swingline  Loans owing to the Swingline Lender and of L/C Disbursements owing to any Issuing Bank shall be  considered to be owed to the Revolving Facility Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective  Revolving Facility Credit Exposure) (determined at the time such indemnity is sought), from and against  any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or  disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the  Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender in  any way relating to or arising out of the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents  or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby  or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender under or in  connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion  of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or  disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to  have resulted from such Agent&#8217;s, Issuing Bank&#8217;s or Swingline Lender&#8217;s gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  The failure of any Lender to reimburse any Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the  case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be paid by the Lenders  to such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve  any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender,  as the case may be, for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure  167  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    of any other Lender to reimburse such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, for  such other Lender&#8217;s ratable share of such amount.  The agreements in this Section 8.07 shall survive the  payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  Section 8.08 Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  Each Agent and its affiliates may make  loans to, accept deposits from, and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though  such Agent were not an Agent.  With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any  Letter of Credit issued, or Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan participated in, by it, each Agent shall have  the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may  exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms &#8220;Lender&#8221; and &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall include each  Agent in its individual capacity.  Section 8.09 Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may resign  as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent upon 10 days&#8217; notice to the Lenders and the Borrower.  If  the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent under this Agreement  and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to the reasonable  consent of the Borrower, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (so long as no Event of Default under  Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing), to appoint a successor which shall be  a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United  States, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative  Agent and Collateral Agent, and the term &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221; shall mean such successor agent effective  upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent&#8217;s rights, powers and duties as  Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former  Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans.  If no successor  agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring  Administrative Agent&#8217;s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation shall  nevertheless thereupon become effective (except in the case of the Collateral Agent holding collateral  security on behalf of such Secured Parties, the retiring Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such collateral  security as nominee until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed), and the Lenders shall  assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereunder until such  time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

Furthermore, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties hereby authorize  the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to release any Lien on any property granted to or held  by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (i) to the holder of any Lien  on such property that is permitted by clauses (c)(i), (i), (j) and (aa) of Section 6.02 or Section 6.02(a) (if the  Liens thereunder are of a type that is contemplated by any of the foregoing clauses) in each case to the  extent the contract or agreement pursuant to which such Lien is granted prohibits any other Liens on such  property or (ii) that is or becomes Excluded Property; and the Administrative Agent and the Collateral  Agent shall do so upon request of the Borrower; provided, that prior to any such request, the Borrower shall  have in each case delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the  Borrower certifying (x) that such Lien is permitted under this Agreement, (y) in the case of a request  pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, that the contract or agreement pursuant to which such Lien is granted  prohibits any other Lien on such property and (z) in the case of a request pursuant to clause (ii) of this  sentence, that (A) such property is or has become Excluded Property and (B) if such property has become  Excluded Property as a result of a contractual restriction, such restriction does not violate Section 6.09(c).  Section 8.12 Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guarantees.  In case of the  pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,  adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, (i) the Administrative  169  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein  expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have  made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding  or otherwise (A) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and  unpaid in respect of any or all of the Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents  as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the  Administrative Agent and any Subagents allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (B) to collect and receive  any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and  (ii) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such  judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and Issuing Bank to make such payments to the  Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments  directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the  reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents  and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.  Nothing  contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept  or adopt on behalf of any Lender or Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or  composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or Issuing Bank or to authorize the  Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or Issuing Bank in any such proceeding.  Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the  Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Secured Party (other than the Agent)  hereby agree that (a) no Secured Party (other than the Agent) shall have any right individually to realize  upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Guarantee, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights  and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured  Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security  Documents may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent, and (b) in the event of a foreclosure by the  Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the  Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such  sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties  (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders  shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or  payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use  and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by  the Collateral Agent at such sale or other Disposition.   Section 8.13 Withholding Tax.  To the extent required by any applicable Requirement  of Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to  any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United States or  other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts  paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not  delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of  a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective),  such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not  already been reimbursed by any applicable Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any applicable  Loan Party to do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax  or otherwise, including penalties, fines, additions to Tax and interest, together with all expenses incurred,  including legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket expenses.  Each Lender hereby  authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such  Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative  Agent under this Section 8.13.  </FONT></DIV>

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each party  hereto shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of  such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.   Without limitation of the requirements of Section 9.04(d), no Lender shall have any obligation to  disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any person (including the identity of any  Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any Commitments, Loans or  other Loan Obligations under any Loan Document), except to the extent that such disclosure is  necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other Loan Obligation is in registered form  for U.S. federal income tax purposes or is otherwise required by applicable law.  For the avoidance  of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no  responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (iii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under  Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with  respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such  Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent, which consent shall state that it is  being given pursuant to this Section 9.04(d)(iii); provided, that each potential Participant shall  provide such information as is reasonably requested by the Borrower in order for the Borrower to  determine whether to provide its consent.  (e) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any  portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge  or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction  over it and in the case of any Lender that is an Approved Fund, any pledge or assignment to any holders  of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Lender, including to any trustee for, or any other  representative of, such holders, and this Section 9.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment  176  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    of a security interest; provided, that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a  Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender  as a party hereto.  (f) The Borrower and the Co-Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the  relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the  type described in clause (e) above.  (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of  the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the consent of the Borrower  or the Administrative Agent.  Each of Holdings, the Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative  Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other person in  instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or  liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the  payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided,  however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold  harmless each other party hereto and each Loan Party for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out  of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of  forbearance.  (h) If the Borrower wishes to replace the Loans or Commitments under any  Facility with ones having different terms, it shall have the option, with the consent of the Administrative  Agent and subject to at least three Business Days&#8217; advance notice to the Lenders under such Facility,  instead of prepaying the Loans or reducing or terminating the Commitments to be replaced, to  (i) require the Lenders under such Facility to assign such Loans or Commitments to the Administrative  Agent or its designees and (ii) amend the terms thereof in accordance with Section 9.08 (with such  replacement, if applicable, being deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 9.08(d)).  Pursuant to  any such assignment, all Loans and Commitments to be replaced shall be purchased at par (allocated  among the Lenders under such Facility in the same manner as would be required if such Loans were  being optionally prepaid or such Commitments were being optionally reduced or terminated by the  Borrower and the Co-Borrower), accompanied by payment of any accrued interest and fees thereon and  any amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.05(b).  By receiving such purchase price, the Lenders under  such Facility shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans or Commitments under such  Facility pursuant to the terms of the form of Assignment and Acceptance attached hereto as Exhibit A,  and accordingly no other action by such Lenders shall be required in connection therewith.  The  provisions of this clause (h) are intended to facilitate the maintenance of the perfection and priority of  existing security interests in the Collateral during any such replacement.  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including  Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (i) or (j) of this Section 9.04), any  of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower, may purchase by way of assignment and  become an Assignee with respect to Term Loans at any time and from time to time from Lenders in  accordance with Section 9.04(b) hereof (each, a &#8220;Permitted Loan Purchase&#8221;); provided, that, in respect  of any Permitted Loan Purchase, (A) no Permitted Loan Purchase shall be made from the proceeds of  any extensions of credit under any Revolving Facility, (B) upon consummation of any such Permitted  Loan Purchase, the Loans purchased pursuant thereto shall be deemed to be automatically and  immediately cancelled and extinguished in accordance with Section 9.04(j), (C) in connection with any  such Permitted Loan Purchase, any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower and such  Lender that is the assignor (an &#8220;Assignor&#8221;) shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a  Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance (and for the avoidance of doubt, (x) shall make  the representations and warranties set forth in the Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance  177  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    and (y) shall not be required to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to  Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) and shall otherwise comply with the conditions to assignments under this  Section 9.04 and (D) no Default or Event of Default would exist immediately after giving effect on a  Pro Forma Basis to such Permitted Loan Purchase.  (j) Each Permitted Loan Purchase shall, for purposes of this Agreement be  deemed to be an automatic and immediate cancellation and extinguishment of such Term Loans and  the Borrower shall, upon consummation of any Permitted Loan Purchase, notify the Administrative  Agent that the Register be updated to record such event as if it were a prepayment of such Loans.  (k) In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting  Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other  conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments  to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate  (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or  other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting  Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay  and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative  Agent, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued  thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations  in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Facility Percentage; provided  that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any  Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the  provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting  Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Section 9.05 Expenses; Indemnity.  (a) The Borrower agrees to pay   (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the  other Loan Documents, or by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the  administration of this Agreement and any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof  or thereof, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel LLP,  counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Arrangers and the Co-Manager, and, if  necessary, the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one local counsel per jurisdiction, and (ii) all  out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in  connection with the enforcement of their rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents, in connection with the Loans made or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including the  fees, charges and disbursements of a single counsel for all such persons, taken as a whole, and, if necessary,  a single local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction for all such persons, taken as a whole (and, in the  case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where such person affected by such conflict informs the  Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent  (not to be unreasonably withheld), of another firm of such for such affected person).  (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral  Agent, the Arrangers, the Co-Manager, the Joint Bookrunners, each Issuing Bank, each Lender, the  Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents, each of their respective Affiliates, successors and  assignors, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and  members (each such person being called an &#8220;Indemnitee&#8221;) against, and to hold each Indemnitee  harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including  reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements (excluding the allocated costs of in house counsel  </FONT></DIV>

None of the Indemnitees  (or any of their respective affiliates) shall be responsible or liable to the Fund, Holdings, the Borrower  or any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates or stockholders or any other person or entity for any  special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, which may be alleged as a result of the Facilities  or the ADT Transactions.  The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force  and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or  unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any  investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender.

(c) Except as expressly provided in Section 9.05(a) with respect to Other Taxes,  which shall not be duplicative with any amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.17, this Section 9.05 shall  not apply to any Taxes (other than Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related  expenses resulting from a non-Tax claim), which shall be governed exclusively by Section 2.17 and, to  the extent set forth therein, Section 2.15.  (d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Holdings and the Borrower  shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for  special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising  out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement  or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter  179  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising  from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through  telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this  Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.  (e) The agreements in this Section 9.05 shall survive the resignation of the  Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank, the replacement of any Lender, the  termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other  Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  Section 9.06 Right of Set-off.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing, each Lender and each Issuing Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to  the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or  demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other Indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or  such Issuing Bank to or for the credit or the account of Holdings (prior to a Qualified IPO), the Borrower  or any Subsidiary against any of and all the obligations of Holdings (prior to a Qualified IPO) or the  Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender  or such Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall have made any  demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although the obligations may be  unmatured; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff,  (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application  in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such  Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent  and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a  statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it  exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender and each Issuing Bank under this Section 9.06 are  in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender or such Issuing  Bank may have.  Section 9.07 Applicable Law.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSES OF ACTION  (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (OTHER THAN AS  EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN  ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,  WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PRINCIPLE OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT COULD REQUIRE THE  APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW.  Section 9.08 Waivers; Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative  Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any Loan  Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or  power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other  or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the  Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents  are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver  of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by Holdings,  the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be  permitted by clause (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific  instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand on Holdings, the Borrower or any other  Loan Party in any case shall entitle such person to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other  circumstances.  180  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision  hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except (x) as provided in Section 2.14 or  Section 2.21, (y) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing  entered into by Holdings (prior to a Qualified IPO), the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or, (A) in  respect of any waiver, amendment or modification of Section 6.11 (or any Default or Event of Default  in respect thereof) or of Section 4.01 after the Closing Date, the Required Revolving Facility Lenders  voting as a single Class, rather than the Required Lenders, or (B) in respect of any waiver, amendment  or modification of Section 2.11(b) or (c), the Required Prepayment Lenders, rather than the Required  Lenders), and (z) in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in  writing entered into by each Loan Party party thereto and the Administrative Agent and consented to  by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall:  (i) decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final maturity  of, or decrease the rate of interest on, any Loan or any L/C Disbursement, or extend the stated  expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity Date (except  as provided in Section 2.05(c)), without the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely  affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such Lender directly  adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to make such modification);  provided, that any amendment to the financial definitions in this Agreement shall not constitute a  reduction in the rate of interest for purposes of this clause (i),  (ii) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender, or decrease the  Commitment Fees, L/C Participation Fees, any other Fees or prepayment premium of any Lender  without the prior written consent of such Lender (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such  consent of such Lender shall be the only consent required hereunder to make such modification);  provided, that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or Events of  Default, mandatory prepayments or of a mandatory reduction in the aggregate Commitments shall  not constitute an increase or extension of the Commitments of any Lender for purposes of this  clause (ii),  (iii) extend or waive any Term Loan Installment Date or reduce the amount  due on any Term Loan Installment Date or extend any date on which payment of interest on any  Loan or any L/C Disbursement or any Fees is due, without the prior written consent of each Lender  directly adversely affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such  Lender directly adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to make  such modification),  (iv) amend the provisions of Section 7.02 in a manner that would by its terms  alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the prior written consent of each  Lender adversely affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such  Lender directly adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to make  such modification),  (v) amend or modify the provisions of this Section 9.08 or the definition of  the terms &#8220;Required Lenders,&#8221; &#8220;Majority Lenders&#8221; or any other provision hereof specifying the  number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make  any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender  adversely affected thereby (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders,  additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of  the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Loans and Commitments are included  on the Closing Date),   181  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (vi) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially all of  the Subsidiary Loan Parties from their respective Guarantees under the Subsidiary Guarantee  Agreement, unless, in the case of a Subsidiary Loan Party, all or substantially all the Equity  Interests of such Subsidiary Loan Party is sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted  by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of each Lender other than a Defaulting Lender;  (vii) effect any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms adversely  affects the rights in respect of payments or collateral of Lenders participating in any Facility  differently from those of Lenders participating in another Facility, without the consent of the  Majority Lenders participating in the adversely affected Facility (it being agreed that the Required  Lenders may waive, in whole or in part, any prepayment or Commitment reduction required by  Section 2.11 so long as the application of any prepayment or Commitment reduction still required  to be made is not changed);  provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the  Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent  of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank acting as such at the effective date  of such agreement, as applicable.  Each Lender shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification  authorized by this Section 9.08 and any consent by any Lender pursuant to this Section 9.08 shall bind any  Assignee of such Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have the right to approve or  disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which  by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be affected with the consent  of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting  Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver,  amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms  affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require  the consent of such Defaulting Lender.  (c) Without the consent of any Lender or Issuing Bank, the Loan Parties and the  Administrative Agent may (in their respective sole discretion, or shall, to the extent required by any  Loan Document) enter into any amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan Document, or enter  into any new agreement or instrument, to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or  enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for  the benefit of the Secured Parties, to include holders of Other First Liens in the benefit of the Security  Documents in connection with the incurrence of any Other First Lien Debt, or as required by local law  to give effect to, or protect any security interest for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in any property  or so that the security interests therein comply with applicable law or this Agreement or in each case to  otherwise enhance the rights or benefits of any Lender under any Loan Document.  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended  and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent, Holdings  (prior to a Qualified IPO) and the Borrower (a) to permit additional extensions of credit to be  outstanding hereunder from time to time and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations in  respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with  the Term Loans and the Revolving Facility Loans and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations  in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the holders of such extensions of credit in any  determination of the requisite lenders required hereunder, including Required Lenders and the Required  Revolving Facility Lenders.  </FONT></DIV>

(f) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may  take any and all action as may be necessary to ensure that all Term Loans established pursuant to  Section 2.21 after the Closing Date that will be included in an existing Class of Term Loans outstanding  on such date (an &#8220;Applicable Date&#8221;), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of  outstanding Term Loans of such Class (the &#8220;Existing Class Loans&#8221;), on a pro rata basis, and/or to ensure  that, immediately after giving effect to such new Term Loans (the &#8220;New Class Loans&#8221; and, together  with the Existing Class Loans, the &#8220;Class Loans&#8221;), each Lender holding Class Loans will be deemed to  hold its Pro Rata Share of each Class Loan on the Applicable Date (but without changing the amount  of any such Lender&#8217;s Term Loans), and each such Lender shall be deemed to have effectuated such  assignments as shall be required to ensure the foregoing.  The &#8220;Pro Rata Share&#8221; of any Lender on the  Applicable Date is the ratio of (1) the sum of such Lender&#8217;s Existing Class Loans immediately prior to  the Applicable Date plus the amount of New Class Loans made by such Lender on the Applicable Date  over (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Class Loans on the Applicable Date.   (g) With respect to the incurrence of any secured or unsecured Indebtedness  (including any Intercreditor Agreement relating thereto), the Borrower may elect (in its discretion, but  shall not be obligated) to deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer at  least three Business Days prior to the incurrence thereof (or such shorter time as the Administrative  Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion), together with either drafts of the material documentation  relating to such Indebtedness or a description of such Indebtedness (including a description of the Liens  intended to secure the same or the subordination provisions thereof, as applicable) in reasonably  sufficient detail to be able to make the determinations referred to in this paragraph, which certificate  shall either, at the Borrower&#8217;s election, (x) state that the Borrower has determined in good faith that  such Indebtedness satisfies the requirements of the applicable provisions of Sections 6.01 and 6.02  (taking into account any other applicable provisions of this Section 9.08), in which case such certificate  shall be conclusive evidence thereof, or (y) request the Administrative Agent to confirm, based on the  information set forth in such certificate and any other information reasonably requested by the  Administrative Agent, that such Indebtedness satisfies such requirements, in which case the  Administrative Agent may determine whether, in its reasonable judgment, such requirements have been  satisfied (in which case it shall deliver to the Borrower a written confirmation of the same), with any  such determination of the Administrative Agent to be conclusive evidence thereof, and the Lenders  hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to make such determinations.  (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended, waived or  otherwise modified with the written consent of the Required Revolving Facility Lenders, the  Administrative Agent, Holdings (prior to a Qualified IPO) and the Borrower with respect to (i) the  provisions of Section 4.01, solely as they relate to the Revolving Facility Loans, Swingline Loans and  Letters of Credit and (ii) the provisions of Section 6.11.  183  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended, with the  written consent of each Revolving Facility Lender, the Administrative Agent, Holdings and the  Borrower to the extent necessary to integrate any Alternate Currency with respect to the Revolving  Facility Loans or the Letters of Credit.

Section 9.10 Entire Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to  the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have  to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or  the other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court.

Section 9.17 Platform; Borrower Materials.  The Borrower hereby acknowledges that  (a) the Administrative Agent and/or the Arrangers will make available to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks  materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, &#8220;Borrower  Materials&#8221;) by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks or another similar electronic system (the  &#8220;Platform&#8221;), and (b) certain of the Lenders may be &#8220;public-side&#8221; Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to  receive material non-public information (or, if Holdings is not at the time a public reporting company,  material information of a type that would not reasonably be expected to be publicly available if Holdings  was a public reporting company) with respect to Holdings, the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or any of their  respective securities) (each, a &#8220;Public Lender&#8221;).  The Borrower hereby agrees that it will use commercially  reasonable efforts to identify that portion of the Borrower Materials that may be distributed to the Public  Lenders and that (i) all such Borrower Materials shall be clearly and conspicuously marked &#8220;PUBLIC&#8221;  which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word &#8220;PUBLIC&#8221; shall appear prominently on the first page  thereof, (ii) by marking Borrower Materials &#8220;PUBLIC,&#8221; the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized  the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Co-Manager, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders to treat such  Borrower Materials as solely containing information that is either (A) publicly available information or  (B) not material (although it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to Holdings, the Borrower or  its Subsidiaries or any of their respective securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities  laws (provided, however, that such Borrower Materials shall be treated as set forth in Section 9.16, to the  extent such Borrower Materials constitute information subject to the terms thereof), (iii) all Borrower  Materials marked &#8220;PUBLIC&#8221; are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform  designated &#8220;Public Investor;&#8221; and (iv) the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers shall be entitled to treat  any Borrower Materials that are not marked &#8220;PUBLIC&#8221; as being suitable only for posting on a portion of  the Platform not designated &#8220;Public Investor.&#8221;  Section 9.18 Release of Liens and Guarantees.  (a) The Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the other Secured Parties hereby  irrevocably agree that the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent by the Loan Parties on any Collateral  shall be automatically released: (i) in full upon the occurrence of the Termination Date as set forth in  Section 9.18(d) below; (ii) upon the Disposition of such Collateral by any Loan Party to a person that  is not (and is not required to become) a Loan Party in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement  (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan  Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,  with respect to any Disposition constituting an operating lease or license, the underlying property  retained by such Loan Party will not be so released, (iii) to the extent that such Collateral comprises  property leased to a Loan Party, upon termination or expiration of such lease (and the Collateral Agent  may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable  request without further inquiry), (iv) if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in  writing by the Required Lenders (or such other percentage of the Lenders whose consent may be  </FONT></DIV>

Any such release shall not in  any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those being released)  upon (or obligations (other than those being released) of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests  retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any Disposition, all of which shall continue to  constitute part of the Collateral except to the extent otherwise released in accordance with the provisions  of the Loan Documents.    (b) In addition, (i) the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the other Secured Parties  hereby irrevocably agree that the Guarantors shall be automatically released from the Guarantees (and  if such Guarantor is also a Co-Borrower, from its obligations as a Co-Borrower hereunder) upon  consummation of any transaction not prohibited hereunder resulting in such Subsidiary ceasing to  constitute a Subsidiary Loan Party or otherwise becoming an Excluded Subsidiary (and the Collateral  Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its  reasonable request without further inquiry), and (ii) immediately prior to the consummation of a  Qualified IPO of the Borrower, the Guarantee incurred by Holdings of the Obligations shall  automatically terminate and Holdings shall be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents,  shall cease to be a Loan Party and any Liens created by any Loan Documents on any assets or Equity  Interests owned by Holdings shall automatically be released (unless, in each case, the Borrower shall  elect in its sole discretion that such release of Holdings shall not be effected).  (c) The Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the other Secured Parties hereby authorize  the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to execute and deliver any  instruments, documents, and agreements necessary or desirable to evidence and confirm the release of  any Guarantor or Collateral pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.18, all without the  further consent or joinder of any Lender or any other Secured Party.  Any representation, warranty or  covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such Collateral or Guarantor shall no longer  be deemed to be made.  In connection with any release hereunder, the Administrative Agent and the  Collateral Agent shall promptly (and the Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent  and the Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably  requested by the Borrower and at the Borrower&#8217;s expense in connection with the release of any Liens  created by any Loan Document in respect of such Subsidiary, property or asset; provided, that the  Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower  containing such certifications as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan  Document, on the Termination Date, upon request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and/or  the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Secured Party)  take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all Collateral, and to release all  obligations under any Loan Document, whether or not on the date of such release there may be any  (i) obligations in respect of any Secured Hedge Agreements or any Secured Cash Management  Agreements and (ii) any contingent indemnification obligations or expense reimbursement claims not  then due; provided, that the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of a Responsible  Officer of the Borrower containing such certifications as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably  187  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    request.  Any such release of obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such obligations  shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the obligations  guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency,  bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as  a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for,  the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such  payment had not been made.  The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (and their respective  representatives) in connection with taking such actions to release security interest in all Collateral and  all obligations under the Loan Documents as contemplated by this Section 9.18(d).  (e) Obligations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any Secured Cash  Management Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement (after giving effect to all netting arrangements  relating to such Secured Hedge Agreements) shall be secured and guaranteed pursuant to the Security  Documents only to the extent that, and for so long as, the other Obligations are so secured and  guaranteed.  No person shall have any voting rights under any Loan Document solely as a result of the  existence of obligations owed to it under any such Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash  Management Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, no release of Collateral or Guarantors effected  in the manner permitted by this Agreement shall require the consent of any holder of obligations under  Secured Hedge Agreements or any Secured Cash Management Agreements.  Section 9.19 Judgment Currency.  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any  court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into  another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking  procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the  Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of the Borrower and the Co- Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or  under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the &#8220;Judgment  Currency&#8221;) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions  of this Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement Currency&#8221;), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day  following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency,  the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement  Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than  the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or such Co-Borrower in the  Agreement Currency, the Borrower and the Co-Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and  notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the person to whom such  obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater  than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees  to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower and the Co-Borrower (or to any other person who may  be entitled thereto under applicable law).  Section 9.20 USA PATRIOT Act Notice.  Each Lender that is subject to the USA  PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies  the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify  and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address  of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as  applicable, to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act.  188  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    Section 9.21 Affiliate Lenders.  (a) Each Lender who is an Affiliate of the Borrower, excluding (x) Holdings, the  Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries and (y) any Debt Fund Affiliate Lender (each, an &#8220;Affiliate  Lender&#8221;; it being understood that (x) neither Holdings, the Borrower, nor any of their Subsidiaries may  be Affiliate Lenders and (y) Debt Fund Affiliate Lenders and Affiliate Lenders may be Lenders  hereunder in accordance with Section 9.04, subject in the case of Affiliate Lenders, to this  Section 9.21), in connection with any (i) consent (or decision not to consent) to any amendment,  modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of any Loan Document,  (ii) other action on any matter related to any Loan Document or (iii) direction to the Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action)  with respect to or under any Loan Document, agrees that, except with respect to any amendment,  modification, waiver, consent or other action (1) described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the first  proviso of Section 9.08(b) or (2) that adversely affects such Affiliate Lender (in its capacity as a  Lender) in a disproportionately adverse manner as compared to other Lenders, such Affiliate Lender  shall be deemed to have voted its interest as a Lender without discretion in such proportion as the  allocation of voting with respect to such matter by Lenders who are not Affiliate Lenders.  Each  Affiliate Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being  coupled with an interest) as such Affiliate Lender&#8217;s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and  stead of such Affiliate Lender and in the name of such Affiliate Lender, from time to time in the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument that the  Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (a).  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Affiliate  Lender shall have any right to (1) attend (including by telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion  thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any Lender to which representatives of the Borrower are  not then present, (2) receive any information or material prepared by Administrative Agent or any  Lender or any communication by or among Administrative Agent and/or one or more Lenders, except  to the extent such information or materials have been made available to the Borrower or its  representatives, (3) make or bring (or participate in, other than as a passive participant in or recipient  of its pro rata benefits of) any claim, in its capacity as a Lender, against Administrative Agent, the  Collateral Agent or any other Lender with respect to any duties or obligations or alleged duties or  obligations of such Agent or any other such Lender under the Loan Documents, (4) purchase any Term  Loan if, immediately after giving effect to such purchase, Affiliate Lenders in the aggregate would own  Term Loans with an aggregate principal amount in excess of 25% of the aggregate principal amount of  all Term Loans then outstanding or (5) purchase any Revolving Facility Loans or Revolving Facility  Commitments.  It shall be a condition precedent to each assignment to an Affiliate Lender that such  Affiliate Lender shall have (x) represented to the assigning Lender in the applicable Assignment and  Acceptance, and notified the Administrative Agent, that it is (or will be, following the consummation  of such assignment) an Affiliate Lender and that the aggregate amount of Term Loans held by it giving  effect to such assignments shall not exceed the amount permitted by clause (d) of the preceding  sentence and (y) represented in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance that it is not in possession  of material non-public information (within the meaning of United States federal and state securities  laws) with respect to Holdings, the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or their respective securities (or, if  Holdings is not at the time a public reporting company, material information of a type that would not  be reasonably expected to be publicly available if Holdings were a public reporting company) that  (A) has not been disclosed to the assigning Lender or the Lenders generally (other than because any  such Lender does not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to Holdings, the  Borrower or its Subsidiaries) and (B) could reasonably be expected to have a material effect upon, or  otherwise be material to, the assigning Lender&#8217;s decision make such assignment.  189  Doc#: US1:18059326v3    Section 9.22 Agency of the Borrower for the Loan Parties.  Each of the other Loan  Parties hereby appoints the Borrower as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and the other  Loan Documents, including the giving and receipt of notices and the execution and delivery of all  documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and therein and all modifications hereto and  thereto.  Section 9.23 No Liability of the Issuing Banks.  The Borrower and the Co-Borrower  assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect  to its use of such Letter of Credit.  Neither any Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be  liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of  any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of  documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects  invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by such Issuing Bank against presentation of  documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to  bear any reference or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever  in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the Borrower and the Co- Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to the  Borrower and the Co-Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by the  Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by (i) such Issuing Bank&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross  negligence as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in  determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the Letter  of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Bank&#8217;s willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after  the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter  of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents  that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any  notice or information to the contrary.   Section 9.24 Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial  Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement,  arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of  any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is  unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority  and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:  (a)  the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the  applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by  any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and  (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:  (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or  other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a  bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other  instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability  under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the  exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.  </FONT></DIV>

To the extent that the  Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Obligation or any other  agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221; and each such QFC, a  &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated  thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit  Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported  QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States  or any other state of the United States):  (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a  &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer  of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in  or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such  Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same  extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported  QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were  governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.  In the event a Covered Party  or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special  Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such  Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are  permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the  U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the  laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
