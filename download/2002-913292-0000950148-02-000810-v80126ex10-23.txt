of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the satisfaction or waiver of

part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar
Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its

such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) each Lender shall use

pursuant to Section 2.11(1) or Section 2.11(6) or make Eurodollar Loans
unavailable under Section 2.11(3).

          (b) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $500,000 and not less than $4,000,000. At the time that each
Alternate Base Rate Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $1,000,000;
provided that an Alternate Base Rate Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount

required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by
Section 2.2(5). Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same
time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of five (5)
Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.

          (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the

          8.14;

               (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

               (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an Alternate Base Rate
          Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;

               (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest

part of the requested Borrowing.

          (4) Lending Offices. The Loans of each Lender shall be made and
maintained at such Lender's Applicable Lending Office for Loans of such Type.

          (5) Several Obligations. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan to

make a Loan to be made by such other Lender.

     thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its books and, prior to any
     transfer of the Note held by it, endorsed by such Lender on the schedule
     attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that the
     failure of such Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement shall
     not affect the obligations of Borrower to make a payment when due of any
     amount owing hereunder or under such Note in respect of such Loans.

          (c) Substitution, Exchange and Subdivision of Notes. No Lender shall
     be entitled to have its Note substituted or exchanged for any reason, or
     subdivided for promissory notes of lesser denominations, except in
     connection with a permitted assignment of all or any portion of such
     Lender's Commitment, Loans and Note pursuant to Section 11.24 and/or in
     connection with a Secondary Market Transaction pursuant to Section 11.9
     and/or pursuant to Section 11.10 (and, if requested by any Lender, Borrower
     agrees to so substitute or exchange any Note).

     the loss, theft or destruction of any Note, upon Borrower's receipt of a
     reasonably satisfactory indemnification agreement executed in favor of
     Borrower by the holder of such Note, or in the event of the mutilation of
     any Note, upon the surrender of such mutilated Note by the holder thereof

outstanding at any given time to exceed the ABR Limitation, except under the
circumstances provided in Sections 2.2(5), 2.11(1), 2.11(2) and 2.11(3) and as

<PAGE>

own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the

In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this

hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC
Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the
date due as provided in paragraph (5) of this Section, or of any reimbursement
payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant

the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

          (5) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement

notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided,
however, that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth
herein, request in accordance with Section 2.1(3) that such payment be financed
with an Alternate Base Rate Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent
so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged
and replaced by the resulting Alternate Base Rate Borrowing and, if such
Alternate Base Rate Borrowing would cause the aggregate amount of the Alternate
Base Rate Borrowings to exceed the ABR Limitation, then, to the extent required
to reduce the aggregate amount of the Alternate Base Rate Borrowings to the ABR
Limitation, such Alternate Base Rate Borrowing shall be Converted into a
Eurodollar Borrowing by either adding the principal amount of such Alternate
Base Rate Borrowing to the principal amount of the Eurodollar Borrowing which is
next scheduled to be Continued hereunder or, if no Eurodollar Borrowings are
outstanding, by Converting such Alternate Base Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Loan
on the earliest day on which the Borrower would be able to obtain a Eurodollar
Loan under Section 2.1. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement,
the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's
Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the
payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section
2.3 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.3 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than
the funding of Alternate Base Rate Loans as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

          (6) Obligations Absolute. Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (5) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein; (ii) any draft or
other


                                       31
<PAGE>

document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or
invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in
any respect; provided that payment by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of
Credit against presentation of such draft or document shall not have constituted
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (iii) payment by the
Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other
document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; provided
that such payment shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Issuing Bank; or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder;
provided that such other circumstance or happening shall not have been the
result of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (7) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

          (8) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower



                                       32
<PAGE>

reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to
Alternate Base Rate Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse
such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section, then
Section 2.6(3) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be
for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after
the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section to
reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent
of such payment.

          (9) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced
at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At
the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all
unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.13(2). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

          (10) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders demanding the deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account
with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for
the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of
such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the
obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately,
and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or
other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Borrower described in Sections 9.8 or 9.9. Such deposit shall be
held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance
of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative
Agent shall have control (as such term is defined in the UCC), including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned
on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the
option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's
risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Majority
Lenders) be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to
the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be


                                       33
<PAGE>

returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default
have been cured or waived.

     Section 2.3 Funding of Borrowings Each Lender shall make each Loan to be
made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available
to the Borrower not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account in the United States designated by
the Borrower; provided, however, that Alternate Base Rate Loans made to finance
the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.2(5) shall be
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

     Section 2.4 Interest Elections.

          (1) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the
applicable Borrowing Request and, in the event of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall
have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.
Thereafter, Borrower may elect to Convert such Borrowing to a different Type or
to Continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect
Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

          (2) To make an election pursuant to this Section, Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.1(3) if the Borrower were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

          (3) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information:

               (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
          and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
          portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
          resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
          pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
          resulting Borrowing);

               (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
          Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

               (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an Alternate Base
          Rate Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and



                                       34
<PAGE>

               (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
          Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
          election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of
          the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one (1) month's duration.

          (4) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (5) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be Continued as
a Eurodollar Borrowing having an Interest Period of one (1) month's duration.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Majority Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default
is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be Converted to or Continued as a
Eurodollar Borrowing having an Interest Period other than one (1) month and (ii)
unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing having an Interest Period greater than
one (1) month shall be Converted to an Eurodollar Borrowing having an Interest
Period of one (1) month at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

     Section 2.5 Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

          (1) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on
the Maturity Date.

          (2) Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce,
the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in
an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments
if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance
with this Agreement, the sum of the Credit Exposures would exceed the total
Commitments.

          (3) Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to
terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (2) of this Section at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or
reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly
following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant
to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of
the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case
such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be



                                       35
<PAGE>

permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

     Section 2.6 Interest Rate; Late Charge.

          (1) The Loans comprising each Alternate Base Rate Borrowing shall bear
interest at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate. The
Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate of
interest per annum equal to the Adjusted Libor Rate plus the Applicable Margin
(the "Contract Rate").

          (2) Interest shall be computed on the basis of a fraction, the
denominator of which is three hundred sixty (360) and the numerator of which is
the actual number of days elapsed from the date of the initial advance or the
date on which the immediately preceding payment was due.

          (3) If Borrower fails to pay any installment of interest or principal
on the date on which the same is due, Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent (on behalf of the Lenders), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
interest at the Default Rate on such amount from the date when due until paid,
but not in excess of the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law.
In addition, but without duplicating amounts due under the prior sentence, while
any Event of Default exists, the Loans shall bear interest at the Default Rate;
provided, however, that during the continuance of an Event of Default the
Administrative Agent may suspend the right of Borrower to Continue any Loan as a
Eurodollar Loan having an Interest Period of greater than one (1) month, in
which event all Loans shall be Converted (on the last day(s) of the respective
Interest Periods therefor) into Eurodollar Loans having an Interest Period of
greater than one (1) month.

     Section 2.7 Terms of Payment. The Loans shall be payable as follows:

          (1) Interest. Borrower shall pay interest in arrears on (a) in the
case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the last day of each Interest Period (or, in the
case of a Eurodollar Borrowing with an Interest Period of more than one (1)
month's duration, each day prior to the last day of such Interest Period that
occurs at intervals of one (1) month's duration after the first day of such
Interest Period) and (b) in the case of an Alternate Base Rate Borrowing, the
first Business Day of each month, in any case until all Obligations are paid in
full; provided, however, that (i) interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.6(3)
shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of
any Loan (other than a prepayment of an Alternate Base Rate Loan prior to the
end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid
or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and
(iii) in the event of any Conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of
the then current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall
be payable on the effective date of such Conversion.

          (2) [Reserved]

          (3) Maturity. On the Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) all outstanding principal,
accrued and unpaid interest, and any other Obligations (other than Unmatured
Surviving Obligations) due under the Loan Documents.


                                       36
<PAGE>

          (4) Voluntary Prepayment. Borrower shall have the right at any time
and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without
penalty, subject to prior notice in accordance with this paragraph. Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of
any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three (3) Business
Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an
Alternate Base Rate Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
one (1) Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of
prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of
the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.5(3), then such notice of
prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance
with Section 2.5(3). Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that
would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as
provided in Section 2.1. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably
to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied
by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.7(1) and any applicable
expenses pursuant to Section 2.11(5).

          (5) Mandatory Prepayment. If, at any time from and after the Closing
Date, (i) the Company or Borrower merges or consolidates with another Person and
the Company or Borrower, as the case may be, is not the surviving entity, or
(ii) the Company, Borrower, any of its consolidated Subsidiaries ceases to
provide property management services (excluding for such purposes property
management contracts with third parties that are terminable on not more than 30
days' notice) to Properties accounting for at least 80% of the aggregate base
rental revenues from all of the Properties in which Borrower has an ownership
interest (the date any such event shall occur being the "Prepayment Date"),
Borrower shall be required to prepay the Loans in their entirety as if the
Prepayment Date were the Maturity Date and the Commitments thereupon shall be
terminated. Borrower shall immediately make such prepayment on the Prepayment
Date and shall return or cause to be returned all Letters of Credit to the
Issuing Bank. In connection with the prepayment of any Loan prior to the
maturity thereof, Borrower shall also pay any applicable expenses pursuant to
Section 2.11(5) hereof. Each such prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably
the Loans of the Lender. Amounts prepaid pursuant to this subsection (5) may not
be reborrowed.

          (6) Borrowing Base Imbalance. If at any time the aggregate Credit
Exposure of the Lenders at such time exceeds the lower of (a) the Borrowing Base
and (b) the then effective Commitments at such time (a "Borrowing Base
Imbalance"), Borrower shall prepay the Loans then outstanding in an amount equal
to such excess, together with accrued interest within one (1) Business Day of
such event occurring. It is understood that a Borrowing Base Imbalance may occur
or exist as a result of, among other things, changes to the Underwritten Value
of any of the Projects and/or the determination or re-determination of the
Appraised Value of any of the Projects. In connection with any such prepayment,
Borrower shall also pay any applicable expenses pursuant to Section 2.11(5).

          (7) Application of Payments. All payments received by the
Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents shall be applied: first, to any
fees and expenses then payable



                                       37
<PAGE>

by Borrower under the Loan Documents; second, to any Default Rate interest or
late charges; third, to accrued and unpaid interest; and fourth, to the
principal sum and other amounts due under the Loan Documents; provided, however,
that, if an Event of Default exists the Administrative Agent shall apply such
payments in any order or manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine.

     Section 2.8 Security. The Loans shall be secured by the Mortgages creating
a first lien on each of the Projects, the Assignment of Rents and Leases and the
other Loan Documents.

     Section 2.9 Release of Project. Provided that no Potential Default, Event
of Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance has occurred and is continuing (or would
occur or exist as a result of or following a proposed Project Release), Borrower
shall have the right, subject to the provisions of this Section 2.9 and Section
2.12(5) hereof, to obtain a release of a Project from the Lien of the Mortgage
Documents relating thereto (a "Project Release"). In the event Borrower seeks to
obtain a Project Release, the Administrative Agent shall release such Project
(the "Released Project") from the Lien of the Mortgage Documents relating
thereto, but only upon satisfaction of all of the following conditions:

               (i) Any request for Project Release shall be made in writing to
          the Administrative Agent no less than five (5) Business Days prior to
          the date of the requested Project Release;

               (ii) The proposed Released Project is being sold to or financed
          by a Person that is unaffiliated with either the Borrower or the
          Company pursuant to a bona-fide arm's length sale or financing
          transaction and, in the case of any sale of the Media City Center
          Project, the gross proceeds payable to Borrower are not less than
          $100,000,000;

               (iii) [Reserved]

               (iv) Borrower shall pay all of the Administrative Agent's
          reasonable costs and expenses, including counsel fees and
          disbursements, incurred in connection with the Project Release and the
          review and approval of the documents and information required to be
          delivered in connection therewith; and

               (v) Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
          simultaneously with the request referred to in clause (i) above, (A) a
          Borrowing Base Certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of
          Borrower, representing and certifying the pro forma calculations after
          giving effect to the proposed Project Release, and if such pro forma
          Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrates that the Project Release would
          result in a Borrowing Base Imbalance, Borrower shall not be entitled
          to such Project Release unless Borrower shall prepay Loans
          concurrently with such Project Release and otherwise in accordance
          with Section 2.7(6), and (B) a certification from a Responsible
          Officer as to the bona-fide arm's length nature of the proposed sale
          of such Released Property.

     Section 2.10 Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Etc.

          (1) Payments Generally.

          (a) Payments by Borrower. Except to the extent otherwise provided
     herein, all payments of principal, interest, LC Disbursements and other
     amounts to be made by Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, and,
     except to the extent otherwise provided therein, all payments to be made by
     Borrower under any other Loan Document, shall be made in Dollars, in
     immediately available funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to
     the Administrative Agent at an account designated by the Administrative
     Agent by notice to Borrower, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time,
     on the date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment made
     after such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next
     succeeding Business Day).

          (b) Application of Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section
     2.7(7), Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment under this
     Agreement or any Note for the account of any Lender, specify to the
     Administrative Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s)
     thereof) the Loans, LC Disbursements or other amounts payable by Borrower
     hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that
     Borrower fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, the Administrative Agent may distribute such payment to the
     Lenders and the Issuing Bank for application in such manner as it may
     determine to be appropriate, subject to Section 2.10(2) and any other
     agreement among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank
     with respect to such application).

          (c) Forwarding of Payments by Administrative Agent. Except as
     otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing
     Bank, each payment received by the Administrative Agent under this
     Agreement or any Note for account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall
     be paid by the Administrative Agent promptly to such Lender or the Issuing
     Bank, as applicable, in immediately available funds, for the account of
     such Lender's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other Obligation in
     respect of which such payment is made (if applicable).

          (d) Extensions to Next Business Day. If the due date of any payment
     under this Agreement or any Note would otherwise fall on a day that is not
     a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
     Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the
     period of such extension.

          (2) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein: (a) each advance of a Loan from the Lenders under Section 2.1(1) shall
be made from the Lenders, and any termination of the obligation to make an
advance of the Loans shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the
Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b)
except as otherwise provided in Section 2.11(4), Loans shall be allocated pro
rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments
(in the case of the making of Loans) or their respective Loans (in the case of
Conversions or Continuations of Loans); (c) each payment or prepayment of
principal of Loans or unreimbursed LC Disbursements by Borrower shall be made
for the account of the Lenders pro rata in

                                       39
<PAGE>

accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans or
unreimbursed LC Disbursements held by them; and (d) each payment of interest on
Loans or unreimbursed LC Disbursements by Borrower shall be made for account of
the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans or
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due and payable to the respective Lenders.

          (3) Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or Borrower (in either
case, the "Payor") prior to the date on which the Payor is to make payment to
the Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Lender) the proceeds of a Loan to
be made by such Lender hereunder or (in the case of Borrower) a payment to the
Administrative Agent for account of any Lender hereunder or the Issuing Bank (in
either case, such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which
notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make
the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to
the intended recipient(s) on such date; and, if the Payor has not in fact made
the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient(s) of such
payment shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made
available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the
period commencing on the date (the "Advance Date") such amount was so made
available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent
recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (a) the Federal Funds Rate for
such day in the case of payments returned to the Administrative Agent by any of
the Lenders or (b) the applicable interest rate due hereunder with respect to
payments returned by Borrower to the Administrative Agent and, if such
recipient(s) shall fail promptly to make such payment, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the Payor, together
with interest as aforesaid, provided that if neither the recipient(s) nor the
Payor shall return the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent within three
(3) Business Days of the Advance Date, then, retroactively to the Advance Date,
the Payor and the recipient(s) shall each be obligated to pay interest on the
Required Payment as follows:

          (a) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment to be made by
     Borrower to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, Borrower and the recipient(s)
     shall each be obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest
     in respect of the Required Payment at the Default Rate (without duplication
     of the obligation of Borrower under Section 2.6 to pay interest on the
     Required Payment at the Default Rate), it being understood that the return
     by the recipient(s) of the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent
     shall not limit such obligation of Borrower under Section 2.6 to pay
     interest at the Default Rate in respect of the Required Payment, and

          (b) if the Required Payment shall represent proceeds of a Loan to be
     made by the Lenders to Borrower, the Payor and Borrower shall each be
     obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest in respect of
     the Required Payment pursuant to whichever of the rates specified in
     Section 2.6 is applicable to the Type of such Loan, it being understood
     that the return by Borrower of the Required Payment to the Administrative
     Agent shall not limit any claim Borrower may have against the Payor in
     respect of such Required Payment.

          (4) Sharing of Payments, Etc.

          (a) Right of Set-off. Each Lender hereby acknowledges that the
     exercise by any Lender of offset, set-off, banker's lien, or similar rights
     against any deposit account or other property or asset of Borrower, whether
     not located in the State of California or any other state with certain laws
     restricting lenders from pursuing multiple collection methods, could result
     under such laws in significant impairment of the ability of all Lenders to
     recover any further amounts in respect of the Loans. Therefore, each Lender
     agrees that neither it nor any of its affiliates shall exercise any right
     of offset, set-off, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any assets of the
     Borrower which may be in its hands (including all general or special, time
     or demand, provisional or other deposits and other indebtedness owing by
     such Person to or for the credit or the account of Borrower) in respect of
     any obligation owed by Borrower under the Loan Documents without the prior
     written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders.

          (b) Sharing. If any Lender shall obtain from Borrower payment of any
     principal of or interest on any Loan or any participation in LC
     Disbursements owing to it or payment of any other amount under this
     Agreement or any other Loan Document through the exercise of any right of
     set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise (other
     than from the Administrative Agent as provided herein), and, as a result of
     such payment, such Lender shall have received a greater percentage of the
     principal of or interest on the Loans, participations in LC Disbursements
     or such other amounts then due hereunder or thereunder by Borrower to such
     Lender than the percentage received by any other Lender, it shall promptly
     purchase from such other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the
     extent specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans,
     participations in LC Disbursements or such other amounts, respectively,
     owing to such other Lenders (or in interest due thereon, as the case may
     be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as
     shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders shall share the benefit
     of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may be incurred by such
     Lender in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in
     accordance with the unpaid principal of and/or interest on the Loans,
     participations in LC Disbursements or such other amounts, respectively,
     owing to each of the Lenders. To such end all the Lenders shall make
     appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations
     sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be
     restored.

          (c) Consent by Borrower. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing
     such a participation (or direct interest) may exercise all rights of
     set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such
     participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans,
     participations in LC Disbursements or other amounts (as the case may be)
     owing to such Lender in the amount of such participation.

          (d) Rights of Lenders; Bankruptcy. Nothing contained herein shall
     require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of
     any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such
     right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of Borrower. If,
     under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any
     Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a set-off to which this


                                       41
<PAGE>

     Section 2.10(4) applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable,
     exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent
     with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section 2.10(4) to share
     in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

     Section 2.11 Yield Protection; Etc.

          (1) Additional Costs.

          (a) Costs of Making or Maintaining Eurodollar Loans. Borrower shall
     pay directly to each Lender and the Issuing Bank from time to time such
     amounts as such Lender or the Issuing Bank may reasonably determine to be
     necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank for any costs that
     such Lender or the Issuing Bank determines are attributable to its making
     or maintaining of any Eurodollar Loans or issuing or maintaining any
     Letters of Credit or its obligation to make any Eurodollar Loans or issue
     or participate in any Letters of Credit hereunder, or any reduction in any
     amount receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder in respect
     of any of such Loans or Letters of Credit or such obligations (such
     increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called
     "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change that:

          (i) shall subject any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office for any
     of such Loans) or the Issuing Bank to any tax, duty or other charge in
     respect of such Loans or its Note or any Letters of Credit or changes the
     basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender or the Issuing Bank
     under this Agreement or its Note in respect of any of such Loans or any
     Letters of Credit (excluding changes in the rate of tax on the overall net
     income or franchise taxes in lieu of taxes on the overall net income of
     such Lender or of such Applicable Lending Office or the Issuing Bank by the
     jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or such
     Applicable Lending Office or the Issuing Bank has its principal office); or

          (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar
     requirements (other than the Reserve Requirement used in the determination
     of the Adjusted Libor Rate for any Interest Period for such Loan) relating
     to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or
     other liabilities of, such Lender (including, without limitation, any of
     such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition of "Libor Base
     Rate") or the Issuing Bank, or any commitment of such Lender (including,
     without limitation, the Commitment of such Lender hereunder) or the Issuing
     Bank; or

          (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or its Note
     (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities) or its Commitment or
     any Letter of Credit or its participation therein.

If any Lender or the Issuing Bank requests compensation from Borrower under this
paragraph (a), Borrower may, by notice to such Lender or the Issuing Bank (with
a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender
thereafter to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans or suspend the obligation of the
Issuing Bank to issue or maintain Letters of



                                       42
<PAGE>

Credit, or to Convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans, until the Regulatory Change
giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions
of Section 2.11(4) shall be applicable), provided that such suspension shall not
affect the right of such Lender or the Issuing Bank to receive the compensation
so requested, and shall be permitted to obtain Alternate Base Rate Loans.

          (b) Costs Attributable to Regulatory Change or Risk-Based Capital
     Guidelines. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
     Section 2.11(1) (but without duplication), Borrower shall pay directly to
     each Lender and the Issuing Bank from time to time on request such amounts
     as such Lender or the Issuing Bank may determine to be necessary to
     compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank (or, without duplication, the
     bank holding company of which such Lender or the Issuing Bank is a
     subsidiary) for any costs that it determines are attributable to the
     maintenance by such Lender or the Issuing Bank (or any Applicable Lending
     Office or such bank holding company), pursuant to any law or regulation or
     any interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the force
     of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) of
     any court or governmental or monetary authority (i) following any
     Regulatory Change or (ii) implementing any risk-based capital guideline or
     other requirement (whether or not having the force of law and whether or
     not the failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) hereafter issued by
     any government or governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the
     national level the Basle Accord, of capital in respect of its Commitment or
     Loans or Letters of Credit (such compensation to include, without
     limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on
     assets or equity of such Lender or the Issuing Bank (or any Applicable
     Lending Office or such bank holding company) to a level below that which
     such Lender or the Issuing Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office or such
     bank holding company) could have achieved but for such law, regulation,
     interpretation, directive or request.

          (c) Notification and Certification. Each Lender or the Issuing Bank,
     as applicable, shall notify Borrower of any event occurring after the date
     hereof entitling such Lender or the Issuing Bank to compensation under
     paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.11(1) as promptly as practicable,
     but in any event within 180 days, after such Lender or the Issuing Bank
     obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided that (i) if any Lender or the
     Issuing Bank fails to give such notice within 180 days after such an event,
     such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall, with respect to compensation payable
     pursuant to this Section 2.11(1) in respect of any costs resulting from
     such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 2.11(1) for
     costs incurred from and after the date 180 days prior to the date that such
     Lender or the Issuing Bank does give such notice and (ii) each Lender will
     designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loans of such
     Lender affected by such event if such designation will avoid the need for,
     or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole
     opinion of such Lender, be disadvantageous to such Lender, except that such
     Lender shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending Office
     located in the United States of America. Each Lender or the Issuing Bank,
     as applicable, will furnish to Borrower a certificate setting forth the
     basis and amount of each request by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
     applicable, for compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section
     2.11(1). Determinations and allocations by any Lender or the Issuing Bank,
     as applicable, for


                                       43
<PAGE>

     purposes of this Section 2.11(1) of the effect of any Regulatory Change
     pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.11(1), or of the effect of
     capital maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.11(1), on
     its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans or issuing, maintaining or
     participating in Letters of Credit or its obligation to make Loans or to
     issue, maintain or participate in Letters of Credit, or on amounts
     receivable by it in respect of Loans or Letters of Credit, and of the
     amounts required to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
     applicable, under this Section 2.11(1), shall be conclusive, provided that
     such determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable basis.

          (2) Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of the Libor Base Rate for
any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan:

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be
     conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits
     referred to in the definition of Libor Base Rate are not being provided in
     the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
     determining rates of interest for Eurodollar Loans as provided herein; or

          (b) the Majority Lenders determine, which determination shall be
     conclusive, and notify the Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of
     interest referred to in the definition of Libor Base Rate upon the basis of
     which the rate of interest for Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period is
     to be determined are not likely adequately to cover the cost to such
     Lenders of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give Borrower and each Lender prompt notice
thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be
under no obligation to make additional Eurodollar Loans, to Continue Eurodollar
Loans or to Convert Loans of any other Type into Eurodollar Loans, and Borrower
shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the
outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Loans or such Loans shall be
automatically Converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans.

          (3) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending
Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder
(and, in the sole opinion of such Lender, the designation of a different
Applicable Lending Office would either not avoid such unlawfulness or would be
disadvantageous to such Lender), then such Lender shall promptly notify Borrower
thereof (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and such Lender's obligation
to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, Eurodollar
Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and
maintain Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 2.11(4) shall
be applicable).

          (4) Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of any Lender to
make or to Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Alternate Base Rate Loans
into Eurodollar Loans, shall be suspended pursuant to Section 2.11(1) or
2.11(3), such Lender's Loans shall be automatically Converted into Alternate
Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for
Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion resulting from a circumstance



                                       44
<PAGE>

described in Section 2.11(3), on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to
Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such
Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in
Section 2.11(1) or 2.11(3) that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

          (a) to the extent that such Lender's Loans have been so Converted, all
     payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to
     such Lender's Loans shall be applied instead to its Alternate Base Rate
     Loans; and

          (b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender
     as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Alternate Base
     Rate Loans, and all Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted
     into Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Alternate Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent
that the circumstances specified in Section 2.11(1) or 2.11(3) that gave rise to
the Conversion of such Lender's Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(4) no longer
exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing
to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding,
such Lender's Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the
first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto,
all Alternate Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans are allocated among the
Lenders ratably (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

          (5) Compensation. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through the
Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or
expense that such Lender determines is attributable to:

          (a) any payment, prepayment or Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan made by
     such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration
     of the Loans pursuant to the Administrative Agent's or the Lenders' rights
     referred to in Article 10) on a date other than the last day of the
     Interest Period for such Loan; or

          (b) any failure by Borrower for any reason to borrow a Eurodollar Loan
     from such Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant
     Borrowing Request given to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the
     terms of this Agreement.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall
include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid,
Converted or not borrowed for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the
Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified
for such borrowing) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided
for herein over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on
such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest component of the
amount such Lender would have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar

                                       45
<PAGE>

deposits of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and
with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such
Lender), or if such Lender shall cease to make such bids, the equivalent rate,
as reasonably determined by such Lender, derived from Page 3750 of the Dow Jones
Markets (Telerate) Service or other publicly available source as described in
the definition of Libor Base Rate.

          (6) U.S. Taxes.

          (a) Gross-up for Deduction or Withholding of U.S. Taxes. Borrower
     agrees to pay to each Lender and Issuing Bank that is not a U.S. Person
     such additional amounts as are necessary in order that the net payment of
     any amount due to such non-U.S. Person hereunder after deduction for or
     withholding in respect of any U.S. Taxes imposed with respect to such
     payment (or in lieu thereof, payment of such U.S. Taxes by such non-U.S.
     Person), will not be less than the amount stated herein to be then due and
     payable, provided that the foregoing obligation to pay such additional
     amounts shall not apply:

          (i) to any payment to any Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder unless such
     Lender or Issuing Bank is, on the date hereof (or on the date it becomes a
     Lender hereunder as provided in Section 11.24(2) or an Issuing Bank
     hereunder as provided in Section 2.2) and on the date of any change in the
     Applicable Lending Office of such Lender, entitled to submit either a Form
     W-8BEN (relating to such Lender or Issuing Bank and entitling it to a
     complete exemption from withholding on all interest to be received by it
     hereunder) or a Form W-8ECI (relating to all interest to be received by
     such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder), or

          (ii) to any U.S. Taxes imposed solely by reason of the failure by such
     non-U.S. Person to comply with applicable certification, information,
     documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality,
     residence, identity or connections with the United States of America of
     such non-U.S. Person if such compliance is required by statute or
     regulation of the United States of America as a precondition to relief or
     exemption from such U.S. Taxes.

For the purposes hereof, (A) "U.S. Person" means a citizen, national or resident
of the United States of America, a corporation, limited liability company,
partnership or other entity created or organized in or under any laws of the
United States of America or any State thereof, or any estate or trust that is
subject to Federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income, (B)
"U.S. Taxes" means any present or future tax, assessment or other charge or levy
imposed by or on behalf of the United States of America or any taxing authority
thereof or therein, (C) "Form W-8BEN" means Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign
Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding) of the Department
of the Treasury of the United States of America and (D) "Form W-8ECI" means Form
W-8ECI (Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for Exemption from Withholding on
Income Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the
United States) of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of
America. Each of the Forms referred to in the foregoing clauses (C) and (D)
shall include such successor and related forms as may from time to time be
adopted by the relevant taxing authorities of the United States of America to
document a claim to which such Form relates.


                                       46
<PAGE>

          (b) Evidence of Deduction, Etc. Within 30 days after paying any amount
     to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from which it is required by law
     to make any deduction or withholding, and within 30 days after it is
     required by law to remit such deduction or withholding to any relevant
     taxing or other authority, Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
     Agent for delivery to such non-U.S. Person evidence reasonably satisfactory
     to such Person of such deduction, withholding or payment (as the case may
     be).

          (c) Notification and Certification. Each Lender or the Issuing Bank,
     as applicable, shall notify Borrower of any event occurring after the date
     hereof entitling such Lender or the Issuing Bank to payments under
     paragraph (a) of this Section 2.11(6) as promptly as practicable, but in
     any event within 180 days, after such Lender or the Issuing Bank obtains
     actual knowledge thereof; provided that if any Lender or the Issuing Bank
     fails to give such notice within 180 days after it actually knew, or should
     reasonably have known, of such an event, such Lender or the Issuing Bank
     shall, with respect to payments due pursuant to this Section 2.11(6) in
     respect of any additional payments resulting from such event, only be
     entitled to payment under this Section 2.11(6) for additional payments
     relating to periods from and after the date 180 days prior to the date that
     such Lender or the Issuing Bank does give such notice. Each Lender or the
     Issuing Bank, as applicable, will furnish to Borrower a certificate setting
     forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender or the Issuing
     Bank, as applicable, for payments under paragraph (a) of this Section
     2.11(6) and the amount set forth on such certificate shall be conclusive
     absent manifest error and shall be paid by Borrower within ten (10) days
     after receipt of such certificate.

          (7) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation
pursuant to Section 2.11(1) or 2.11(6), or any Lender's obligation to Continue
Loans of any Type, or to Convert Loans of any Type into the other Type of Loan,
shall be suspended pursuant to Section 2.11(2) or 2.11(3) or any Lender defaults
in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder (any such Lender requesting such
compensation, or whose obligations are so suspended or who has defaulted, being
herein called a "Requesting Lender"), Borrower, upon three (3) Business Days
notice, may require that such Requesting Lender transfer all of its right, title
and interest under this Agreement and such Requesting Lender's Note to any bank
or other financial institution (a "Proposed Lender") identified by Borrower that
is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (i)
if such Proposed Lender agrees to assume all of the obligations of such
Requesting Lender hereunder, and to purchase all of such Requesting Lender's
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements hereunder for consideration equal
to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Requesting Lender's Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements, together with interest thereon to the
date of such purchase (to the extent not paid by Borrower), and reasonably
satisfactory arrangements are made for payment to such Requesting Lender of all
other amounts accrued and payable hereunder to such Requesting Lender as of the
date of such transfer (including any fees accrued hereunder and any amounts that
would be payable under Section 2.11(5) as if all of such Requesting Lender's
Loans were being prepaid in full on such date) and (ii) if such Requesting
Lender has requested compensation pursuant to Section 2.11(1) or 2.11(6), such
Proposed Lender's aggregate requested compensation, if any, pursuant to Section
2.11(1) or 2.11(6) with respect to such Requesting Lender's Loans is lower than
that of the Requesting Lender. Subject to the



                                       47
<PAGE>

provisions of Section 11.24(2), such Proposed Lender shall be a "Lender" for all
purposes hereunder. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
Borrower hereunder, the agreements of Borrower contained in Sections 2.11(1),
2.11(6) and 11.5 (without duplication of any payments made to such Requesting
Lender by Borrower or the Proposed Lender) shall survive for the benefit of such
Requesting Lender under this Section 2.11(7) with respect to the time prior to
such replacement. The right to replace a defaulting Lender under this Section
shall not in any way reduce any rights which Borrower may have against such
Lender as a consequence of such default.

     Section 2.12 Borrowing Base Determination.

          (1) Initial Projects. As of the date hereof, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders have accepted the Properties listed on Schedule 2.12 as Projects
for the purposes of the Borrowing Base as of the Closing Date, provided that the
parties acknowledge and agree that: (a) Borrower owns only a ground leasehold
interest in the Media City Center Project, (b) the Media City Center Project is
partially enclosed, (c) the PML for the Media City Center Project is greater
than 20% and (d) the Wal-Mart at the Baldwin Hills Mall is a single-tenant
retail store.

          (2) Additional Projects. If Borrower desires that the Administrative
Agent accept an additional Property as an Eligible Project for the purposes of
the Borrowing Base, Borrower shall so notify the Administrative Agent in writing
and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed and completed due
diligence request form in the form attached as Exhibit F hereto. The
Administrative Agent's acceptance of such Property in the Borrowing Base shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that such
Property shall meet the requirements for Eligible Projects specified herein and
provided further that a Property shall not be accepted as an Eligible Project
unless and until Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent (i) Mortgage
Documents in respect of such Property including, without limitation, the
payments specified in clause (g) of the definition of Mortgage Documents, (ii)
the Eligible Project Documents relating to such Property in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (iii) payment of the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection therewith (including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent).

          (3) Wal-Mart at Baldwin Hills Mall. With respect to the Project known
as the Wal-Mart at the Baldwin Hills Mall in Los Angeles, California, until the
tenant under the Wal-Mart Lease has been paying monthly base rent for four (4)
full fiscal quarters, the monthly rental payments made by the tenant under the
Wal-Mart Lease shall be annualized for purposes of determining the Underwritten
Value and Net Operating Income for such Project, but otherwise the Underwritten
Value and Net Operating Income for such Project be determined (and shall remain
subject to change) as provided in the definitions of Underwritten Value and Net
Operating Income.

          (4) Inspections. The Administrative Agent, at the expense of the
Lenders (except as hereinafter provided), may make physical and other
verifications of any Projects included in the Borrowing Base in any reasonable
manner and through any medium that the Administrative Agent considers advisable,
and Borrower shall furnish all such assistance and information as the
Administrative Agent may require in connection therewith. Notwithstanding



                                       48
<PAGE>

the foregoing, if any such inspection results in the Administrative Agent
determining that such Project is not an Eligible Project, then such inspection
shall be at the expense of the Borrower and the Borrower shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent for its reasonable expenses in connection therewith within
ten (10) days after written request.

          (5) Required Number and Value of Projects. At no time shall (a) there
be less than five (5) Projects included in the collateral for the Obligations,
(b) the Underwritten Value of all of the Projects be less than $100,000,000 or
(c) the Underwritten Value of the Media City Center Project be permitted, for
purposes of determining the Borrowing Base, to be greater than the lesser of
$104,000,000 and an amount equal to fifty-six percent (56%) of the Underwritten
Value of all of the Projects (including the Media City Center Project) and in
the event that the Underwritten Value of the Media City Center Project is
greater than the lesser of $104,000,000 and an amount equal to fifty-six percent
(56%) of the Underwritten Value of all of the Projects (including the Media City
Center Project), the Borrowing Base shall not be increased by or credited with
the amount by which the Underwritten Value of the Media City Center Project is
greater than the lesser of $104,000,000 and an amount equal to fifty-six percent
(56%) of the Underwritten Value of all of the Projects (including the Media City
Center Project).

          (6) Appraisals. The Administrative Agent shall have the right, at the
expense of Borrower, to require reappraisals of the Projects if the same are
required pursuant to a legal requirement, provided that no more than one
reappraisal shall be required for each Project in any twelve (12) month period.

          (7) Ineligibility. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, a Property shall cease to be an Eligible Project (and a Project for
Borrowing Base purposes) if it shall cease to comply with the requirements
therefor set forth herein, unless otherwise approved by the Majority Lenders and
the Administrative Agent at the time of such ineligibility.

     Section 2.13 Fees.

          (1) Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender an unused facility fee, which shall accrue at a rate of 0.375%
per annum on the daily amount of the unused Commitment of such Lender during the
period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which
such Commitment terminates. Accrued unused facility fees shall be payable in
arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and
on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing as of the date
hereof. All unused facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day).

          (2) Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in
Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate of 2.50% per annum on the
average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and
including the date hereof to but excluding the later of the date on which such
Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have
any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue
at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between Borrower and the
Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of



                                       49
<PAGE>

the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
Disbursements) during the period from and including the date hereof to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date
on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's
standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees
and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day
following such last day, commencing as of the date hereof; provided that all
such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and
any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall
be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to
this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation
fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day).

          (3) Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

          (4) Borrower agrees to pay to GECC and/or Affiliates of GECC, for
their account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed
upon between Borrower and GECC and/or such Affiliates.

          (5) Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the Lenders, a commitment fee in an amount equal to $1,500,000, such
commitment fee being payable on the Closing Date.

          (6) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

                                    ARTICLE 3

                  INSURANCE, CONDEMNATION, AND LOCKBOX ACCOUNT

     Section 3.1 Insurance. Borrower shall maintain insurance as follows:

          (1) Casualty; Business Interruption. Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries shall keep each Property insured against damage by fire and the
other hazards covered by a standard extended coverage and all-risk insurance
policy for the full insurable value thereof (without reduction for depreciation
or co-insurance), and shall maintain such other casualty insurance as reasonably
required by the Administrative Agent. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
shall keep each Property insured against loss by flood if such Property is
located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as an
area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (and any successor act
thereto) in an amount at least equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum amount of
the Loans or (ii) the maximum limit of coverage available under said


                                       50
<PAGE>

act. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries shall maintain use and occupancy
insurance covering, as applicable, rental income or business interruption, with
coverage in an amount not less than twelve (12) months anticipated gross rental
income or gross business earnings, as applicable in each case, attributable to
the Properties. In addition, Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries shall obtain
earthquake insurance in amounts and in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in the event and to the extent any of
the Properties is located in an area with a high degree of seismic activity as
reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. The proceeds of insurance
paid on account of any damage or destruction to any Project shall be paid to the
Administrative Agent to be applied as provided in Section 3.2. Administrative
Agent acknowledges that, as of the Closing Date, the insurance coverages in
effect on the Closing Date are satisfactory to Administrative Agent.

          (2) Liability. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries shall maintain
(a) commercial general liability insurance with respect to each Property
providing for limits of liability of not less than $5,000,000 for both injury to
or death of a person and for property damage per occurrence, and (b) other
liability insurance as reasonably required by the Administrative Agent.

          (3) Form and Quality. All insurance policies covering any of the
Projects shall be endorsed in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent to name the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders)
as an additional insured, loss payee or mortgagee thereunder, as its interest
may appear, with loss payable to the Administrative Agent, without contribution,
under a standard New York (or local equivalent) mortgagee clause. All such
insurance policies and endorsements shall be fully paid for and contain such
provisions and expiration dates and be in such form and issued by such insurance
companies licensed to do business in the relevant State, with a rating of "A-IX"
or better as established by Best's Rating Guide (or an equivalent rating
reasonably approved in writing by the Administrative Agent). Each policy shall
provide that such policy may not be cancelled or materially changed except upon
thirty (30) days' prior written notice of intention of non-renewal, cancellation
or material change to the Administrative Agent and that no act or thing done by
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall invalidate any policy as against the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. If Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries fails
to maintain insurance in compliance with this Section 3.1, the Administrative
Agent may obtain such insurance and pay the premium therefor and Borrower shall,
on demand, reimburse the Administrative Agent for all reasonable expenses
incurred in connection therewith. Borrower shall assign the policies or proofs
of insurance covering any of the Projects to the Administrative Agent (on behalf
of the Lenders), in such manner and form that the Administrative Agent and its
successors and assigns shall at all times have and hold the same as security for
the payment of the Loans. Borrower shall deliver copies of all original policies
certified to the Administrative Agent by the insurance company or authorized
agent as being true copies, together with the endorsements required hereunder.
The proceeds of insurance policies coming into the possession of the
Administrative Agent shall not be deemed trust funds, and the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to apply such proceeds as herein provided.

          (4) Adjustments. Borrower shall give immediate written notice of any
loss at any of the Projects to the insurance carrier and to the Administrative
Agent. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower hereby
irrevocably authorizes and empowers



                                       51
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent, as attorney-in-fact for Borrower coupled with an
interest, to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any claim under
insurance policies, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such
insurance policies, to collect and receive insurance proceeds, and to deduct
therefrom the Administrative Agent's expenses incurred in the collection of such
proceeds. Nothing contained in this Section 3.1(4), however, shall require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to incur any expense or take any action
hereunder.

     Section 3.2 Use and Application of Insurance Proceeds. The Administrative
Agent shall apply insurance proceeds relating to any of the Projects to costs of
restoring a Project or to the Obligations as follows:

          (1) if the loss is less than or equal to $250,000, the Administrative
Agent shall apply the insurance proceeds to restoration provided (a) no Event of
Default, Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance exists, and (b) Borrower
promptly commences and is diligently pursuing restoration of the Project;

          (2) if the loss (A) exceeds $250,000 but is not more than (B)
$1,000,000, then the Administrative Agent shall apply the insurance proceeds to
restoration provided that at all times during such restoration (a) no Event of
Default, Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance exists; (b) the
Administrative Agent determines that there are sufficient funds available to
restore and repair the Project to a condition reasonably approved by the
Administrative Agent; (c) the Administrative Agent determines that restoration
and repair of the Project to a condition reasonably approved by the
Administrative Agent will be completed within 12 months after the date of loss
or casualty (or such later date on which the business interruption insurance
maintained for such Project expires) and in any event ninety (90) days prior to
the Maturity Date; and (d) Borrower promptly commences and is diligently
pursuing restoration of the Project;

          (3) if the conditions set forth above are not satisfied or the loss
exceeds the maximum amount specified in clause (B) of Section 3.2(2) above, in
the Administrative Agent's sole discretion, the Administrative Agent may
(subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders) apply any insurance proceeds
it may receive to the payment of the Obligations or allow all or a portion of
such proceeds to be used for the restoration of a Project; and

          (4) insurance proceeds applied to restoration will be disbursed on
receipt of satisfactory plans and specifications, contracts and subcontracts,
schedules, budgets, lien waivers and architects' certificates, and otherwise in
accordance with prudent commercial construction lending practices for
construction loan advances. If, after the restoration is completed and all costs
relating thereto have been paid, there are excess insurance proceeds, then,
provided no Event of Default, Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance
exists, the Administrative Agent shall remit such excess proceeds to Borrower.
If, after the restoration is completed and all costs relating thereto have been
paid, there are excess insurance proceeds which are being held by or for the
Administrative Agent and an Event of Default, Potential Default or Borrowing
Base Imbalance exists, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion
(which the Administrative Agent shall exercise at the direction of the Majority
Lenders) apply the same in accordance with Section 2.7(7), it being understood
that if any such Event of Default, Potential Default or


                                       52
<PAGE>

Borrowing Base Imbalance is cured prior to such application, then the
Administrative Agent shall remit such excess proceeds to Borrower.

     Section 3.3 Condemnation Awards. Borrower shall immediately notify the
Administrative Agent of the institution of any proceeding for the condemnation
or other taking of a Property or any portion thereof. In the case of a
condemnation or other taking of a Project, the Administrative Agent may
participate in any such proceeding and Borrower will deliver to the
Administrative Agent all instruments necessary or required by the Administrative
Agent to permit such participation. In the case of a condemnation or other
taking of a Project, without the Administrative Agent's prior consent (subject
to the approval of the Majority Lenders), Borrower (1) shall not agree to any
compensation or award, and (2) shall not take any action or fail to take any
action which would cause the compensation to be determined. All awards and
compensation for the taking or purchase in lieu of condemnation of a Project or
any part thereof are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to the Administrative
Agent and applied by Administrative Agent as if the same were insurance proceeds
and as provided in Section 3.2. If and for so long as an Event of Default,
Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance exists and is continuing, Borrower
authorizes the Administrative Agent to collect and receive awards and
compensation relating to any of the Projects, to give proper receipts and
acquittances therefor, and in the Administrative Agent's sole discretion (which
the Administrative Agent shall exercise at the direction of the Majority
Lenders) to apply the same in accordance with Section 2.7(7), notwithstanding
that the Obligations may not then be due and payable, or to the restoration of a
Project; provided, however, that if the award is less than or equal to $250,000
and Borrower requests that such proceeds be used for non-structural site
improvements (such as landscape, driveway, walkway and parking area repairs)
required to be made as a result of such condemnation, the Administrative Agent
will apply the award to such restoration in accordance with disbursement
procedures applicable to insurance proceeds provided there exists no Potential
Default, Event of Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance, and if, after such
restoration is completed and all costs relating thereto have been paid, there is
an excess condemnation award or other compensation and no Event of Default,
Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalances exists, the Administrative Agent
shall remit such excess to Borrower. If, after such restoration is completed and
all costs relating thereto have been paid, there is an excess condemnation award
or other compensation which is being held by or for Administrative Agent and an
Event of Default, Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance exists, the
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion (which the Administrative Agent
shall exercise at the direction of the Majority Lenders), apply the same in
accordance with Section 2.7(7), it being understood that if any such Event of
Default, Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance is cured prior to such
application, then the Administrative Agent shall remit such excess condemnation
award or other compensation to Borrower. Borrower, upon request by the
Administrative Agent, shall execute all instruments requested to confirm the
assignment of the awards and compensation to the Administrative Agent, free and
clear of all liens, charges or encumbrances.

     Section 3.4 Lockbox Account.

          (1) Borrower has established and will maintain with Bank of America,
N.A. (the "Lockbox Bank") a separate segregated account (no. 14200-06771) (the
"Lockbox Account") for the Projects. The Lockbox Account is owned by Borrower
for income tax purposes, but is subject to a Three-Party Agreement Relating to
Lockbox Services (With



                                       53
<PAGE>

Activation), dated as of June 1, 2002, among the Lockbox Bank, Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (the "Lockbox Agreement"). Borrower has granted to the
Administrative Agent a first priority security interest in the Lockbox Account
and all deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof pursuant
to the Cash Collateral Account Agreement and will take all actions necessary to
maintain in favor of the Administrative Agent a perfected first priority
security interest in the Lockbox Account, including, without limitation,
executing and filing UCC-1 financing statements and continuations thereof and
entering into control agreements with the Administrative Agent and/or the
Lockbox Bank to confirm the Administrative Agent's control (as defined in the
UCC) over the Lockbox Account and sending notices to the Lockbox Bank and
otherwise cooperating with the Administrative Agent in its obtaining of control
(as defined in the UCC) over the Lockbox Account. The Administrative Agent shall
have the sole right to make withdrawals from the Lockbox Account and all costs
and expenses for establishing and maintaining the Lockbox Account shall be paid
by Borrower when due.

          (2) Borrower has delivered, or has caused the Manager to deliver, or
concurrently herewith will deliver, or cause Manager to deliver written
instructions in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto to all tenants under
leases at the Projects to deliver all rents and other amounts payable thereunder
directly to the Lockbox Bank for deposit into the Lockbox Account. Borrower
shall, and shall cause Manager to, deposit all amounts received by Borrower or
Manager and relating to any of the Projects into the Lockbox Account (and no
other account, except as provided under subparagraph (5) below) promptly upon
receipt.

          (3) Unless an Event of Default exists and is continuing, the Lockbox
Bank shall be permitted to sweep on a daily basis all funds in the Lockbox
Account to an account maintained by, and under the control of, Borrower (such
account being referred to as the "Borrower Account") as designated in writing by
Borrower. Borrower shall be entitled to use and apply all funds deposited into
the Borrower Account. If an Event of Default exists and is continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, at its option, instruct the Lockbox Bank to cease
sweeping funds into the Borrower Account and all funds will be swept daily from
the Lockbox Account to an account (the "Cash Management Account") in the name of
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders, which Cash Management
Account shall be under the control (as defined in the UCC) of the Administrative
Agent. The Cash Management Account shall be entitled "CT Operating Partnership,
L.P. for the benefit of General Electric Capital Corporation, as the
Administrative Agent and Secured Party," provided that the Administrative Agent
shall have the option to cause the financial institution maintaining such
account to change the name of the Cash Management Account by giving notice to
Borrower and such institution. Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative
Agent a first priority security interest in the Cash Management Account and all
deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof and will take
all actions necessary to maintain in favor of the Administrative Agent a
perfected first priority security interest in the Cash Management Account,
including, without limitation, executing and filing UCC-1 Financing Statements
and continuations thereof and entering into agreements to confirm the
Administrative Agent's control (as defined in the UCC) over the Cash Management
Account and/or any sub-accounts thereof and sending notices to the institution
maintaining the Cash Management Account and otherwise cooperating with the
Administrative Agent in its obtaining of control (as defined in the UCC) over
the Cash Management Account. The Administrative Agent shall have the sole right
to make withdrawals from the Cash


                                       54
<PAGE>

Management Account and, unless Borrower is no longer the owner of the Projects,
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses for establishing and maintaining
the Cash Management Account shall be paid by Borrower. All funds on deposit in
the Lockbox Account or in the Cash Management Account following the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default may be applied by the
Administrative Agent in such order and priority as the Administrative Agent
shall determine. No delay or omission of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
in exercising any right under this Section shall impair any such right, or shall
be construed as a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any Event of Default.

          (4) If Borrower receives any rents or other income from any Project,
then (i) such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit, and as the
property, of Administrative Agent, subject to the terms of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, (ii) such amounts shall not be commingled with any
other funds or property of Borrower and (iii) Borrower shall deposit such
amounts into the Lockbox Account (and no other account, except as provided in
subparagraph (5) below) within two (2) Business Days of receipt.

          (5) If Borrower desires to establish and maintain, in addition to the
Lockbox Account identified above, any one or more other separate segregated
accounts with the Lockbox Bank or any other financial institution reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent (any such other financial institution, an
"Additional Lockbox Bank") for any one (1) or more of the Projects (any such
account, an "Additional Lockbox Account"), then Borrower shall so notify the
Administrative Agent in writing with respect thereto and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, at Borrower's sole cost and expense, any and all
agreements, certificates, opinions, financing statements, documents or
instruments reasonably required by the Administrative Agent in connection with
the Additional Lockbox Account (collectively, "Additional Lockbox Account
Documents"), including, without limitation, (a) a pledge and security agreement
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (or an amendment to or an
amendment and restatement of the Cash Collateral Account Agreement) creating in
favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a perfected
first priority lien on and security interest in the Additional Lockbox Account
and any and all funds and deposits at any time held therein, including without
limitation, all interest earned thereon and all proceeds thereof, (b) a written
agreement reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent executed and delivered
by Borrower and the applicable Lockbox Bank or Additional Lockbox Bank to
confirm the Administrative Agent's control (as defined in the UCC) over the
Additional Lockbox Account, (c) written instructions in substantially the form
of Exhibit G hereto to all tenants under leases at the Project(s) in question to
deliver all rents and other amounts payable thereunder directly to the
applicable Lockbox Bank or Additional Lockbox Bank for deposit into the
applicable Additional Lockbox Account, (d) UCC-1 financing statements (or
amendments to existing UCC-1 financing statements) reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent, (e) documents reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
Agent evidencing the formation, organization, valid existence, good standing,
and due authorization of and for Borrower and the Company for the execution,
delivery, and performance of the Additional Lockbox Account Documents by such
parties and (f) legal opinions issued by counsel for Borrower, opining (i) as to
the due organization, valid existence and good standing of Borrower, (ii) as to
the due authorization, execution, delivery, enforceability and validity of the
Additional Lockbox Account Documents with respect to Borrower and (iii) that the
Administrative Agent has a valid and perfected lien on and security interest in
the Additional Lockbox Account. The Administrative Agent's consent to the

                                       55
<PAGE>

establishment, maintenance and use of any particular Additional Lockbox Bank or
Additional Lockbox Account shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, provided that Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent (i)
Additional Lockbox Account Documents in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (ii) payment of the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection therewith (including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent). If the
Administrative Agent has consented in writing to the establishment, maintenance
and use of any particular Additional Lockbox Bank or Additional Lockbox Account,
then such Additional Lockbox Bank or Additional Lockbox Account, as the case may
be, shall be and be deemed to be a Lockbox Bank or Lockbox Account, as the case
may be, for all purposes of this Agreement.

to the Administrative Agent copies of all orders, notices, permits, applications
and reports made or received in connection with any Release or the presence of
any Hazardous Material, as they may affect any Property or Borrower.

          (2) Borrower shall not cause, shall prohibit any other Person within
the control of Borrower from causing, and shall use prudent, commercially
reasonable efforts to prohibit other Persons (including tenants) from causing
any Release of any Hazardous Materials at, upon, under, within or about any
Property.

          (3) If Administrative Agent or any Lender has a reasonable suspicion
that there may be a material violation of any Environmental Law related to the
Property, Hazardous Materials at or near a Property or a breach of
representations under Section 4.2, or if an Event of Default exists, Borrower
shall provide to the Administrative Agent, at Borrower's expense promptly upon
the written request of the Administrative Agent from time to time, a Site
Assessment or, if required by the Administrative Agent, an update to any
existing Site Assessment, to assess the presence or absence of any Hazardous
Materials and the potential costs in connection with abatement, cleanup or
removal of any Hazardous Materials found on, under, at or within any Property.
Borrower shall pay the cost of no more than one such Site Assessment or update
for each Property in any three (3) month period.

     Section 4.4 Allocation of Risks and Indemnity. As between Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, all risk of loss
associated with non-compliance with Environmental Laws, or with the presence of
any Hazardous Material at, upon, within, contiguous to or otherwise affecting
each Property, shall lie solely with Borrower. Accordingly, Borrower shall bear
all risks and costs associated with any loss (including any loss in value
attributable to Hazardous Materials), damage or liability therefrom, including
all costs of removal of Hazardous Materials or other remediation required by
Environmental Laws. Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders harmless from and against all loss, liabilities, damages,
claims, costs and expenses (including reasonable costs of defense) arising out
of or associated, in any way, with the non-compliance with Environmental Laws,
or the existence of Hazardous Materials in, on, or about any Property, or a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Article 4,
whether based in contract, tort, implied or express warranty, strict liability,
criminal or civil statute or common law, including those arising from the joint,
concurrent, or comparative negligence of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable under such
indemnification to the extent such loss, liability, damage, claim, cost or
expense results solely from the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's gross
negligence or willful



                                       57
<PAGE>

misconduct. Borrower's obligations under this Section 4.4 shall arise upon the
discovery of the presence of any Hazardous Material, whether or not any
governmental authority has taken or threatened any action in connection with the
presence of any Hazardous Material, and whether or not the existence of any such
Hazardous Material or potential liability on account thereof is disclosed in the
Site Assessment and shall continue notwithstanding the repayment of the Loans or
any transfer or sale of any right, title and interest in the applicable Property
(by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise).

     Section 4.5 No Waiver. Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 4 or
elsewhere in the Loan Documents, or any rights or remedies granted by the Loan
Documents, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders do not waive and expressly
reserves all rights and benefits now or hereafter accruing to the Administrative
Agent and/or any Lenders under the "security interest" or "secured creditor"
exception under applicable Environmental Laws, as the same may be amended. No
action taken by the Administrative Agent and/or any Lender pursuant to the Loan
Documents shall be deemed or construed to be a waiver or relinquishment of any
such rights or benefits under the "security interest exception."

                                    ARTICLE 5

                                 LEASING MATTERS

     Section 5.1 Representations and Warranties on Leases. Borrower represents
and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to leases
of the Projects that the following are true, correct and complete in all
material respects: (1) to Borrower's knowledge, the rent rolls delivered to the
Administrative Agent are each true and correct, and the leases are valid and in
and full force and effect; (2) the leases (including amendments) are in writing,
and there are no oral agreements with respect thereto; (3) the copies of the
leases delivered to the Administrative Agent are true and complete; (4) to
Borrower's knowledge, neither the landlord nor any tenant is in default under
any of the leases; (5) Borrower has no knowledge of any notice of termination or
default with respect to any lease; (6) Borrower has not assigned or pledged any
of the leases, the rents or any interests therein except to the Administrative
Agent (on behalf of the Lenders); (7) no tenant or other party has an option to
purchase all or any portion of any Project; (8) no tenant has the right to
terminate its lease prior to expiration of the stated term of such lease; and
(9) no tenant has prepaid more than one month's rent in advance (except for bona
fide security deposits not in excess of an amount equal to two months rent).

     Section 5.2 Standard Lease Form; Approval Rights.

          (1) All leases and other rental arrangements entered into by Borrower
with tenants of the Projects shall in all respects be approved by the
Administrative Agent and shall be on a standard lease form approved by the
Administrative Agent with no modifications (except for modifications made in the
usual and ordinary course of arm's length negotiations of leases in properties
similar to the Projects, recognizing the retail nature of each such Project, and
otherwise consistent with the requirements of this Section 5.2 and except as
approved by the Administrative Agent) or, in the case of a national retail
tenant, a non-standard form lease



                                       58
<PAGE>

utilized by such national retail tenant, provided such non-standard form lease
generally provides the same material benefits to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent as are afforded to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent under the standard form lease approved by the Administrative Agent. Such
lease form (or such non-standard form lease, as applicable) shall provide that
the tenant shall attorn to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders),
and that any cancellation, surrender, or amendment of such lease without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent shall be voidable by the
Administrative Agent. Borrower shall hold, in trust, all tenant security
deposits in a segregated account, and, to the extent required by applicable law,
shall not commingle any such funds with any other funds of Borrower. Within ten
(10) days after the Administrative Agent's request, Borrower shall furnish to
the Administrative Agent a statement of all tenant security deposits, and copies
of all leases not previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, certified by
Borrower as being true and correct.

          (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Loan
Documents, the Administrative Agent's approval shall not be required for future
leases or lease extensions if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there
exists no Potential Default, Event of Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance; (2)
the lease is on the standard lease form approved by the Administrative Agent
with no modifications (except for modifications made in the usual and ordinary
course of arm's length negotiations of leases in properties similar to the
Projects, recognizing the retail nature of each such Project, and otherwise
consistent with the requirements of this Section 5.2 and except as approved by
the Administrative Agent) or, in the case of a national retail tenant, is on a
non-standard form lease utilized by such national retail tenant, provided such
non-standard form lease generally provides the same material benefits to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent as are afforded to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent under the standard form lease approved by the
Administrative Agent; (3) the lease does not conflict with any restrictive
covenant affecting the applicable Project or any other lease for space in the
applicable Project; (4) the leased premises, when combined with all other space
in the Project leased to the same tenant or any affiliate thereof, are not
greater than 10,000 rentable square feet, and the lease term is at least 1
month; and (5) the effective rental rate is at least equal to the then
prevailing fair market rent in the market in which the applicable Project is
located.

          (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Loan
Documents, all leases of space of 10,000 or more rentable square feet (each a
"Major Lease" or a "Major Space") at any Project shall be entered into on a form
previously approved by the Administrative Agent and its counsel without
substantive modification (other than modifications typically made in the usual
and ordinary course of arm's length negotiations of leases of Major Space in
improvements comparable to the improvements at any Project and otherwise
consistent with the requirements of this paragraph hereinafter set forth) unless
approved by the Administrative Agent and its counsel, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. No rent abatement or partial rent abatement (or its
equivalent in tenant concessions) shall be granted under any Major Lease at any
Project without the consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. The Administrative Agent shall, upon request of the
Borrower, review and approve a standard form of lease, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Except as expressly consented to in writing by the
Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders, all Major Leases of space at any
Project shall at the election of the Administrative Agent be subject and
subordinate to the Mortgage and to the lien thereof. The



                                       59
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall, upon request of the Borrower, enter into a
Subordination and Attornment Agreement with respect to any Major Lease.

     Section 5.3 Covenants. Borrower (1) shall perform in all material respects
the obligations which Borrower is required to perform under the leases entered
into by Borrower with tenants of the Projects; (2) shall enforce the obligations
to be performed by the tenants; (3) shall promptly furnish to the Administrative
Agent any notice of default or termination received by Borrower from any tenant,
and any notice of default or termination given by Borrower to any tenant; (4)
shall not collect any rents for more than thirty (30) days in advance of the
time when the same shall become due, except for bona fide security deposits not
in excess of an amount equal to two (2) months rent; (5) shall not enter into as
landlord any ground lease or master lease of any part of any Project; (6) shall
not further assign or encumber any lease; (7) subject to clause (2) above, shall
not, except with the Administrative Agent's prior written consent, cancel or
accept surrender or termination of any Major Lease; and (8) shall not, except
with the Administrative Agent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), modify or amend any lease (except, in the
case of leases other than the Wal-Mart Lease, for minor modifications and
amendments entered into in the ordinary course of business, consistent with
prudent property management practices, not affecting the economic terms of the
lease), and any action in violation of clauses (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this
Section 5.3 shall be void at the election of the Administrative Agent.

     Section 5.4 Tenant Estoppels. At the Administrative Agent's request made
not more than one (1) time in any twelve (12) month period for each tenant or at
any time (and without limitation on the number of such requests) during the
continuation of an Event of Default, (1) Borrower shall request and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and furnish to the Administrative
Agent (1) written estoppels in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, executed by tenants under leases at each Project and
confirming the term, rent, and other provisions and matters relating to the
leases and (2) written Subordination and Attornment Agreements, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by
tenants under leases at each Project, whereby, among other things, such tenants
subordinate their interest in the related Project to the Loan Documents and
agree to attorn to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) and its
successors and assigns upon foreclosure or other transfer of the related Project
after an Event of Default.

                                    ARTICLE 6

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders that:

     Section 6.1 Organization and Power

          (1) Each of the Borrower, the Company and each of their Subsidiaries
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
state of its formation or existence, and is in compliance with legal
requirements applicable to doing business in each State where such compliance is
required. None of the Borrower, the Company or any of their



                                       60
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries is a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code. Schedule 6.1(1) sets forth Borrower's and each
Borrower Party's (i) name as it appears in official filings in the state of its
formation, incorporation or other organization, (ii) the type of entity of
Borrower and each Borrower Party (including corporation, partnership, limited
partnership or limited liability company), (iii) organizational identification
number issued by Borrower's and each Borrower Party's state of incorporation or
organization or a statement that no such number has been issued, (iv) state of
organization or incorporation, (v) chief executive office, other offices, and
all premises where Collateral is stored or located. Borrower and each Borrower
Party has only one state of formation, incorporation or organization.

          (2) Schedule 6.1(2) contains a diagram indicating, as of the date
hereof, the ownership structure of Borrower, and any other Person in which
Borrower holds a direct or indirect partnership, joint venture or other equity
interest, indicating the nature of such interest with respect to each Person
included in such diagram and accurately sets forth (1) the correct legal name of
such Person, the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and the
jurisdictions in which it is qualified to transact business as a foreign
corporation, or otherwise, and (2) the authorized, issued and outstanding shares
or interests of each class of Securities of the Company. As of the date hereof,
none of such issued and outstanding Securities is subject to any vesting,
redemption, or repurchase agreement, and there are no warrants or options (other
than Permitted Securities Options) outstanding with respect to such Securities,
except as noted on such Schedule. The outstanding capital stock of the Company
is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

          (3) None of LFSRI, Prometheus or any of their respective Affiliates is
in default in the performance or observance of their obligations under the
Lazard Agreements.

     Section 6.2 Validity of Loan Documents. The execution, delivery and
performance by Borrower and each Borrower Party of the Loan Documents: (1) are
duly authorized and do not require the consent or approval of any other party or
governmental authority which has not been obtained; and (2) will not violate any
law or result in the imposition of any Lien upon the assets of any such party,
except as contemplated by the Loan Documents. The Loan Documents constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower and each Borrower Party,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws generally affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights.

     Section 6.3 Liabilities; Litigation; Other Secured Loan Transactions.

          (1) The financial statements delivered by Borrower and each Borrower
Party for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 and the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2001 present fairly the financial position and results of
operations and cash flow of the Company, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of
such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP. Except as disclosed in
such financial statements, as of the date thereof, there are no liabilities
(fixed or contingent) affecting any of the Properties, Borrower or any Borrower
Party. Except as disclosed in such financial statements, as of the date thereof,
there is no litigation, administrative proceeding, investigation or other legal
action (including any proceeding under any state or federal bankruptcy or
insolvency law) pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened, against
any of the Properties, Borrower or any Borrower Party which could reasonably be

                                       61
<PAGE>

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on such party, any of the Properties
or the Obligations.

          (2) Neither Borrower nor any Borrower Party is contemplating the
filing of a petition by it under state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency laws,
and neither Borrower nor any Borrower Party has knowledge of any Person
contemplating the filing of any such petition against it. Except as it relates
to the previously disclosed evaluation of the Company's strategic alternatives
currently being conducted by the Company and Merrill Lynch & Co., neither the
Borrower nor any Borrower Party is contemplating the liquidation of all or a
major portion of its assets or property.

          (3) Schedule 6.3(3) sets forth, as of the date hereof, all
Indebtedness of the Company, Borrower and Borrower's Subsidiaries and, as of the
date hereof, except as set forth on Schedule 6.3(3), there are no defaults in
the payment of principal or interest on any such Indebtedness and no payments
thereunder have been deferred or extended beyond their stated maturity and there
has been no material change in the type or amount of such Indebtedness (except
for the repayment of certain Indebtedness) since the date hereof.

          (4) Neither the Company, Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a)
an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

     Section 6.4 Taxes and Assessments. Each Project is comprised of one or more
parcels, each of which constitutes a separate tax lot and none of which
constitutes a portion of any other tax lot. There are no pending or, to
Borrower's best knowledge, proposed, special or other assessments for public
improvements or otherwise affecting any Project, nor are there any contemplated
improvements to any Project that may result in such special or other
assessments, which in any case could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     Section 6.5 Other Agreements; Defaults. Neither Borrower nor any Borrower
Party is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any court order,
injunction, permit, or restriction which might adversely affect any Project or
the business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower or
any Borrower Party. Neither Borrower nor any Borrower Party is in violation of
any agreement which violation would have a materially adverse effect on any
Project, Borrower, or any Borrower Party or Borrower's or any Borrower Party's
business, properties, or assets, operations or condition, financial or
otherwise.

     Section 6.6 Compliance with Law.

          (1) Borrower and each Borrower Party have all material requisite
licenses, permits, franchises, qualifications, certificates of occupancy or
other governmental authorizations to own, lease and operate each Project and
carry on its business, and each Project is in compliance with all applicable
legal requirements and is free of structural defects, and all building systems
contained therein are in good working order, subject to ordinary wear and tear
except in each case where such failure could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.


                                       62
<PAGE>

          (2) As of the date hereof, no condemnation has been commenced or, to
Borrower's knowledge, is contemplated with respect to all or any portion of any
Project or for the relocation of roadways providing access to any Project.

     Section 6.7 Location of Borrower. Borrower's principal place of business
and chief executive offices are located at the address stated in Section 11.1
and, except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 6.7 hereof, Borrower has
maintained such location as its principal place of business and chief executive
office for the last five (5) years.

     Section 6.8 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which
liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $250,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present
value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on
the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements
reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $250,000 the fair market value of
the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

     Section 6.9 Margin Stock. No part of proceeds of the Loans will be used for
purchasing or acquiring any "margin stock" within the meaning of Regulations T,
U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

     Section 6.10 Tax Filings. Borrower and each Borrower Party have filed or
caused to be filed (or have obtained or caused to be obtained effective
extensions for filing) all federal, state and local tax returns required to be
filed and have paid or made adequate provision for the payment of all federal,
state and local taxes, charges and assessments payable by Borrower and each
Borrower Party, respectively, except (a) federal, state or local taxes that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Borrower
or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves
or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 6.11 Solvency. Giving effect to the Loans and the other
Obligations, the fair saleable value of Borrower's assets exceeds and will,
immediately following the making of the Loans and/or the incurrence by Borrower
of such other Obligations, exceed Borrower's total liabilities, including,
without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent
liabilities. The fair saleable value of Borrower's assets is and will,
immediately following the making of the Loans and/or the incurrence by Borrower
of such other Obligations, be greater than Borrower's probable liabilities,
including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities on its Indebtedness
as such Indebtedness becomes absolute and matured. Borrower's assets do not and,
immediately following the making of the Loans and/or the incurrence by Borrower
of such other Obligations will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to
carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower
does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur Indebtedness and
liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its
ability to pay such Indebtedness as it matures (taking into account the



                                       63
<PAGE>

timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be
payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower).

     Section 6.12 Full and Accurate Disclosure. None of the reports, financial
statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or
supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial
information, Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good
faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time. No statement
of fact made by or on behalf of Borrower or any Borrower Party in this Agreement
or in any of the other Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements
contained herein or therein not misleading. There is no fact presently known to
Borrower or any Borrower Party which has not been disclosed to the
Administrative Agent which adversely affects, nor as far as Borrower can
foresee, could reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any Project or the
business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower or any
Borrower Party.

     Section 6.13 Properties.

          (1) Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns good and marketable fee
simple absolute title to all of the real property purported to be owned by it,
which real property is at the date hereof described in Schedule 6.13(1), and
good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all other
properties and assets purported to be leased by Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries. Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries has received all deeds,
assignments, waivers, consents, non-disturbance and recognition or similar
agreements, bills of sale and other documents, and has duly effected all
recordings, filings and other actions necessary to establish, protect and
perfect Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' right, title and interest in and to all
such property except for such documents or actions the failure to obtain or
accomplish which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (2) All material real property leased at the date hereof by Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries is listed on Schedule 6.13(2). Each of such leases is
valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and
effect. Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent true and complete
copies of each of such leases and all documents affecting the rights or
obligations of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which is a party thereto,
including, without limitation, any non-disturbance and recognition agreements,
subordination agreements, attornment agreements and agreements regarding the
term or rental of any of the leases. Neither Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of Borrower, any other party to any such lease is in
default of its obligations thereunder or has delivered or received any notice of
default under any such lease, nor has any event occurred which, with the giving
of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute a default under any
such lease, except for defaults which in the aggregate have no Material Adverse
Effect.

          (3) All components of all improvements included within the Properties
owned or leased, as lessee, by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "Improvements"),



                                       64
<PAGE>

including, without limitation, the roofs and structural elements thereof and the
heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, sewer,
waste water, storm water, paving and parking equipment, systems and facilities
included therein, are in good working order and repair, subject to such
exceptions which are not reasonably likely to have, in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. All water, gas, electrical, steam, compressed air,
telecommunication, sanitary and storm sewage lines and systems and other similar
systems serving the Properties owned or leased by Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries are installed and operating and are sufficient to enable the real
property owned or leased by Borrower and its respective Subsidiaries to continue
to be used and operated in the manner currently being used and operated, and
neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any factor or
condition that reasonably could be expected to result in the termination or
material impairment of the furnishing thereof. No Improvement or portion thereof
is dependent for its access, operation or utility on any land, building or other
Improvement not included in the real property owned or leased by Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries other than for access provided pursuant to a recorded
easement or other right of way establishing the right of such access.

          (4) All permits required to have been issued or appropriate to enable
all real property owned or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to be
lawfully occupied and used for all of the purposes for which they are currently
occupied and used have been lawfully issued and are in full force and effect,
other than those which in the aggregate have no Material Adverse Effect.

          (5) Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice, or has any knowledge, of any pending, threatened or contemplated
condemnation proceeding affecting any real property owned or leased by Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any proposed termination or
impairment of any parking at any such owned or leased real property or of any
sale or other disposition of any real property owned or leased by Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof in lieu of condemnation, which in
the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (6) Except for events or conditions not reasonably likely to have, in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (i) no portion of any real property
owned or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has suffered any material
damage by fire or other casualty loss which has not heretofore been completely
repaired and restored or is in the process of being repaired and restored to its
condition prior to such casualty, and (ii) no portion of any real property owned
or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is located in a special flood
hazard area as designated by any federal governmental authorities.

          (7) Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use,
all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property
material to its business, and the use thereof by Borrower and its Subsidiaries
does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such
infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          (8) Borrower has completed the seismic remediation work relating to
the Media City Center Project more particularly described in a separate written
agreement between Borrower and the Administrative Agent dated as of March 31,
2000.

     Section 6.14 Management Agreement. The Management Agreements identified in
Schedule 6.14 together with any management agreements entered into after the
date hereof in accordance with the terms of Section 8.3 of this Agreement are
the only management agreements in existence with respect to the operation or
management of the Projects. The copies of the Management Agreements delivered to
the Administrative Agent are each a true and correct copy, and each such

     subject Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to Environmental Liabilities
     and Costs which would have a Material Adverse Effect;

          (e) receipt by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any notice of

     Environmental Liabilities and Costs which would have a Material Adverse
     Effect;

          (f) any proposed Capital Expenditure by Borrower or any of its
     Subsidiaries intended or designed to implement any existing or additional
     Remedial Action, unless such expenditures are not reasonably likely to have
     a Material Adverse Effect;

          (g) the commencement of any judicial or administrative proceeding or
     investigation alleging a violation of any Environmental Law; or

          (h) any proposed acquisition of stock, assets or real property, or any

or instruments relating thereto, including without limitation, copies of any

     Section 7.3 Audits. At any time while a Potential Default or Event of
Default exists (including, without limitation, due to any failure on the part of
the Borrower to comply with Sections 7.1(1)(c) or 7.1(2)(c)), the Administrative
Agent shall have the right to choose and appoint a certified public accountant
to perform financial audits as it deems necessary, at Borrower's expense.
Borrower shall permit the Administrative Agent to examine such records, books
and papers of Borrower which reflect upon its financial condition and the income
and expenses relative to the Properties.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                                    COVENANTS

     Borrower covenants and agrees with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
as follows:

     Section 8.1 Cash Sales. Without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (a)
directly or indirectly sell, transfer, convey, mortgage, pledge, or assign any
interest in any Property or any part thereof (including any partnership,
membership or any other ownership interest in Borrower or the Subsidiary owning
any Property) or any of the Agency Notes or (b) further encumber, alienate,
grant a Lien or grant any other interest in any Property or any part thereof
(including any partnership, membership or other ownership interest in Borrower
or the Subsidiary owning any Property or any of the Agency Notes), whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, unless the purchase price or other consideration
payable to Borrower or such Subsidiary consists entirely of cash.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.1, but subject
nevertheless to the limitations of Section 12.4, Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries may, to the extent hereinafter provided in connection with the
sale, transfer, conveyance or assignment of any single Property, accept on
account of the purchase price or other consideration payable for such Property a
note, bond or other evidence of indebtedness from the Person acquiring such
Property (a "Purchase Money Note"), provided that (i) such Purchase Money Note
is secured by a deed of trust or mortgage on the Property in question in favor
of the Borrower or Subsidiary selling, transferring, conveying or assigning the
same (except as and to the extent provided below with respect to



                                       71
<PAGE>

Unsecured Purchase Money Notes) and (ii) the principal amount payable under such
Purchase Money Note does not exceed:

     (A)  in the case of any Project, 5% of the purchase price or other
          consideration payable for such Project; and

     (B)  in the case of any Property which is not, immediately prior to the
          transfer in question, also a Project, an amount which, when added to
          the aggregate of the then unpaid principal amounts of all other
          outstanding Purchase Money Notes accepted by Borrower or any of its
          Subsidiaries in connection with all other such Properties which have
          been transferred since the Closing Date (excluding the Property in
          question), does not exceed 10% of the aggregate of the purchase prices
          and other consideration payable for all such Properties (including the
          Property in question) which have been transferred since the Closing
          Date.

In connection with the transfer of any Property which is not, immediately prior
to the transfer in question, also a Project, Borrower and its Subsidiaries may
accept a Purchase Money Note that is not secured by a deed of trust or mortgage
on the Property in question in favor of the Borrower or Subsidiary transferring
the same (an "Unsecured Purchase Money Note"), provided that (x) the principal
amount payable under such Unsecured Purchase Money Note does not exceed the
limitations imposed under clause (B) above and (y) the outstanding principal
amount payable under all such Unsecured Purchase Money Notes shall not be
permitted to exceed $2,000,000.00 at any given time. In connection with any
sale, transfer, conveyance or assignment of any Property where the purchase
price or other consideration payable for such Property at the time of the sale,
transfer, conveyance or assignment thereof does not consist entirely of cash,
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, reasonably promptly
following the execution and delivery thereof (and in any event not less than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date of the sale, transfer, conveyance or
assignment) copies of the purchase and sale agreement, contract of sale or other
material operative agreement(s), the form of Purchase Money Note and related
mortgage and all other material documents, agreements and instruments pertaining
to the sale, transfer, conveyance or assignment in question, each certified by a
Responsible Officer as being true, correct and complete, and a certificate
signed by such Responsible Officer and stating that such sale, transfer,
conveyance or assignment complies with this Section 8.1.

As used in this Section 8.1, "transfer" shall include the sale, transfer,
conveyance, mortgage, pledge, or assignment of the legal or beneficial ownership
of or the granting of any participation in (a) any Property, (b) any partnership
interest in any general partner in Borrower or any Subsidiary that is a
partnership, (c) any membership interest in any member in Borrower or any
Subsidiary that is a limited liability company, (d) any voting stock in any
general partner in Borrower or any Subsidiary that is a corporation and (e) any
Agency Note; "transfer" shall not include (i) the leasing of any space within
the Properties so long as Borrower and/or the Subsidiary, as applicable,
complies with the provisions of the Loan Documents relating to such leasing
activity; (ii) transfers of limited partnership interests in Borrower, subject
to Section 9.13; and (iii) transfers of Stock of the Company, subject to Section
9.13 and 12.8.

     Section 8.2 Taxes; Charges. Borrower shall not suffer or permit the joint
assessment of any Project with any other real property constituting a separate
tax lot or with any other real or



                                       72
<PAGE>


personal property. Borrower shall pay when due all claims and demands of
mechanics, materialmen, laborers and others which, if unpaid, might result in a
Lien on any Project; provided, however, that Borrower may contest the validity
of such claims and demands so long as Borrower complies with the requirements of
Section 8.11.

     Section 8.3 Project Management. Borrower shall not terminate, replace or
appoint any manager or terminate (except upon a default by the Manager
thereunder and in accordance with the applicable Management Agreement) or amend
the Management Agreement for any Project without the Administrative Agent's
prior written approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If at any time the Administrative Agent consents to the appointment of
a new manager, such new manager and Borrower shall, as a condition of the
Administrative Agent's consent, execute a Manager's Consent and Subordination of
Management Agreement and, if applicable, a Lockbox Agreement, each in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Each manager shall hold and
maintain all necessary licenses, certifications and permits required by law.
Borrower shall fully perform all of its covenants, agreements and obligations
under each Management Agreement.

     Section 8.4 Operation; Maintenance. Borrower shall observe and comply with
all legal requirements applicable to the ownership, use and operation of the
Projects, except where such failure to comply could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Borrower shall maintain each Project in good
condition and promptly repair any damage or casualty.

     Section 8.5 Taxes on Security. Borrower shall pay all taxes, charges,
filing, registration and recording fees, excises and levies payable with respect
to the Notes or the Liens created or secured by the Loan Documents, other than
income, franchise and doing business taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent
or any Lender. If there shall be enacted any law (1) deducting the Loans from
the value of any Project for the purpose of taxation, (2) affecting any Lien on
any Project, or (3) changing existing laws of taxation of mortgages, deeds of
trust, security deeds, or debts secured by real property, or changing the manner
of collecting any such taxes, Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative
Agent, on demand, all taxes, costs and charges for which the Administrative
Agent or any Lender is or may be liable as a result thereof; provided, however,
that if such payment would be prohibited by law or would render the Loans
usurious, then instead of collecting such payment, the Administrative Agent may
(and on the request of the Majority Lenders shall) declare all amounts owing
under the Loan Documents to be immediately due and payable.

     Section 8.6 Legal Existence; Name, Etc.

          (1) Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the
Company to, preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, entity
status, franchises, rights and privileges under the laws of the state of its
formation, and all qualifications, licenses and permits material to the
ownership, use and operation of its property. Except as permitted pursuant to
Section 12.3, neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor the Company shall
wind up, liquidate, dissolve, reorganize, merge, or consolidate with or into, or
convey, sell, assign, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets. Borrower and the Company shall conduct business
only in its own name and shall not change its name, identity,




                                       73
<PAGE>

state of formation or organizational structure, or the location of its chief
executive office or principal place of business or reincorporate or reorganize
itself under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which
it is incorporated or organized as of the date hereof unless Borrower (a) shall
have provided prior written notice to the Administrative Agent of such change,
and (b) shall have taken all actions necessary or reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent to assure perfection and continuation of perfection of
security interests under the Loan Documents. If Borrower does not have an
organizational identification number and later obtains one, Borrower shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such organizational identification
number. Borrower (and each general partner in Borrower, if any), shall maintain
its separateness as an entity, including maintaining separate books, records,
and accounts and observing corporate and partnership formalities independent of
any other entity, shall pay its obligations with its own funds and shall not
commingle funds or assets with those of any other entity.

          (2) The Company shall at all times (1) remain a publicly traded
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange;
(2) retain direct or indirect management and control of Borrower, and (3)
operate its business at all times so as to satisfy all requirements necessary to
qualify as an equity-oriented REIT under the Code. The Company will maintain
adequate records so as to comply with all record-keeping requirements relating
to the qualification of the Company as an equity-oriented REIT as required by
the Code and applicable regulations of the Department of the Treasury
promulgated thereunder and will properly prepare and timely file with the
Internal Revenue Service all returns and reports required thereby. The Company
will request from its shareholders all shareholder information required by the
Code and applicable regulations of the Department of Treasury promulgated
thereunder.

     Section 8.7 [Reserved]

     Section 8.8 Books and Records; Inspection Rights. Borrower will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of record and account in
which full, true and correct entries are made of all dealings and transactions
in relation to its business and activities. Borrower will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, at the expense of any such Lender, unless an
Event of Default, Potential Default or Borrowing Base Imbalance has occurred and
is continuing (in which case at the Borrower's expense), upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours, to visit and inspect its properties, to
examine and make extracts from its books and records, and to discuss its
affairs, finances and condition with its officers and independent accountant,
all at such reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested.

     Section 8.9 Further Assurances. Borrower shall promptly (1) cure any
defects in the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, and (2) execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such other documents,
agreements and instruments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to
further evidence and more fully describe the collateral for the Loans, to
correct any omissions in the Loan Documents, to perfect, protect or preserve any
liens created under any of the Loan Documents, or to make any recordings, file
any notices, or obtain any consents, as may be necessary or appropriate in
connection therewith.

its Subsidiaries to, pay its obligations, including, without limitation, all
present or future taxes levies, imposts, duties, deductions, charges or
withholdings imposed by any governmental authority , that, if not paid, could
result in a Material Adverse Effect before the same shall become delinquent or

indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

     Section 8.13 Compliance with Laws. Borrower will, and will cause each of
its subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any

                                    REMEDIES

     Section 10.1 Remedies - Insolvency Events. Upon the occurrence of any Event
of Default described in Section 9.8 or 9.9, the obligations of the Lenders to
advance amounts



                                       78
<PAGE>

hereunder and of the Issuing Bank to issue, amend, renew and extend Letters of
Credit shall immediately terminate, and all amounts due under the Loan Documents
immediately shall become due and payable, all without written notice and without
presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of intent to
accelerate the maturity thereof, notice of acceleration of the maturity thereof,
or any other notice of default of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by Borrower; however, if the Bankruptcy Party under Section 9.8 or 9.9 is
other than Borrower, then all amounts due under the Loan Documents shall become
immediately due and payable at the Administrative Agent's election, in the
Administrative Agent's sole discretion.

     Section 10.2 Remedies - Other Events. Except as set forth in Section 10.1
above, while any Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent may (1) by
written notice to Borrower, declare the entire amount of the Loans and all other
Obligations to be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,

Loan Documents, then while any Event of Default exists, and without notice to or
demand upon Borrower and without waiving or releasing any other right, remedy or
recourse the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have because of such Event
of Default, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make
such payment or perform such act for the account of and at the expense of
Borrower, and shall have the right to enter upon any Project for such purpose
and to take all such action thereon and with respect to such Project as it may
deem necessary or appropriate. If the Administrative Agent shall elect to pay
any sum due with reference to a Project, the Administrative Agent may do so in
reliance on any bill, statement or assessment procured from the appropriate
governmental authority or other issuer thereof without inquiring into the
accuracy or validity thereof. Similarly, in making any payments to protect the
security intended to be created by the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent
shall not be bound to inquire into the validity of any apparent or threatened
adverse title, lien, encumbrance, claim or charge before making an advance for
the purpose of preventing or removing the same. Additionally, if any Hazardous
Materials affect or threaten to affect any Project, the Administrative Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) give such notices and take such actions as it
deems necessary or advisable in order to abate the discharge of any Hazardous
Materials or remove the Hazardous Materials. Borrower shall indemnify, defend
and hold the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred or accruing by reason
of any acts performed by the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 10.3, including those arising from the joint,
concurrent, or comparative negligence of the Administrative Agent and any
Lender, except as a result of the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. All sums paid by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Section 10.3, and all other sums expended by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender to which it


                                       79
<PAGE>

shall be entitled to be indemnified, together with interest thereon at the
Default Rate from the date of such payment or expenditure until paid, shall
constitute additions to the Loans, shall be secured by the Loan Documents and
shall be paid by Borrower to the Administrative Agent upon demand.

                                   ARTICLE 11

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 11.1 Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under
this Agreement shall be in writing and either shall be mailed by certified mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or sent by overnight air courier
service, or personally delivered to a representative of the receiving party, or

mail, overnight courier, or personal delivery as otherwise provided in this
Section 11.1) to the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices" specified
below its name on the signature pages hereof. Any communication so addressed and
mailed shall be deemed to be given on the earliest of (1) when actually
delivered, (2) on the first Business Day after deposit with an overnight air
courier service, or (3) on the third Business Day after deposit in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, in each case to the address of the intended
addressee, and any communication so delivered in person shall be deemed to be

Lender or Borrower, as the case may be. If given by telecopy, a notice shall be
deemed given and received when the telecopy is transmitted to the party's
telecopy number specified above, and confirmation of complete receipt is
received by the transmitting party during normal business hours or on the next
Business Day if not confirmed during normal business hours, and an identical
notice is also sent simultaneously by mail, overnight courier, or personal
delivery as otherwise provided in this Section 11.1. Any party may designate a
change of address by written notice to each other party by giving at least ten
(10) days prior written notice of such change of address.

     Section 11.2 Amendments, Waivers, Etc.

          (1) Subject to (A) any consents required to be obtained from all of
the Lenders pursuant to this Section 11.2 and any other provisions of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document which expressly require the consent,
approval or authorization of all of the Lenders and (B) any provisions of this
Agreement and any other Loan Document which authorize the Administrative Agent
to act unilaterally, without needing to obtain the consent, approval or
authorization of any of the Lenders, this Agreement and any other Loan Document
may be amended, modified or supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed
by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders (or by the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders);
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may (without any Lender's
consent) (x) enter into minor amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents which are intended to clarify the provisions hereof or thereof, or
which are ministerial in nature, or which are intended to correct any mistakes
or errors herein or therein and (y) give or withhold its agreement to any
waivers or consents under or in respect of the Loan Documents or exercise or
refrain from exercising any other rights or remedies which the Administrative
Agent may have under the Loan Documents or



                                       80
<PAGE>

otherwise provided that, in the case of either of the foregoing clauses (x) and
(y), such actions do not, in the Administrative Agent's judgment reasonably
exercised, materially adversely affect the value of any collateral, taken as a
whole, or represent a departure from the Administrative Agent's standard of care
described in Section 13.5 (and the assignment or granting of a participation by
GECC shall not limit or otherwise affect its discretion in respect of any of the
foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent will not,
without the consent of each Lender, agree to the following (provided that no
Lender's consent shall be required for any of the following which are otherwise
required under the Loan Documents): (a) increase the principal amount of the
Commitments; (b) reduce the principal amount of the Loans or the interest rate
thereon (except that the Majority Lenders may waive the requirement that
interest be paid at the Default Rate); (c) extend any stated payment date for
principal of or interest on the Loans payable to such Lender; (d) release the
Borrower, any Guarantor or any other party from liability under the Loan
Documents; (e) release or subordinate in whole or in part any material portion
of the collateral given as security for the Loans other than in accordance with
Section 2.9; (f) modify any of the provisions of this Section, the definition of
"Majority Lenders" or any other provision in the Loan Documents specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights
thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder; or (g)
consent to (i) the sale, transfer or encumbrance of any portion of a Project (or
any interest therein) or any direct or indirect ownership interest therein and
(ii) the incurrence by Borrower of any additional indebtedness secured by a
Project, in each case to the extent (and subject to any standard of
reasonability) such consent is required under the Loan Documents.

          (2) Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Agreement,
any modification or supplement of Article 13, or of any of the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent hereunder, shall require the consent of the
Administrative Agent.

     Section 11.3 Limitation on Interest. It is the intention of the parties
hereto to conform strictly to applicable usury laws. Accordingly, all agreements
between Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the
Loans are hereby expressly limited so that in no event, whether by reason of
acceleration of maturity or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be
paid to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or charged by any Lender for the
use, forbearance or detention of the money to be lent hereunder or otherwise,
exceed the maximum amount allowed by law. If the Loans would be usurious under
applicable law (including the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the
United States of America), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Loan Documents: (1) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes
interest under applicable law that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged
or received under the Loan Documents shall under no circumstances exceed the
maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law, and any excess shall be
credited on the Notes by the holders thereof (or, if the Notes have been paid in
full, refunded to Borrower); and (2) if maturity is accelerated by reason of an
election by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, or in
the event of any prepayment, then any consideration which constitutes interest
may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. In
such case, excess interest, if any, provided for in the Loan Documents or
otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread from the date of advance until payment in full so
that the actual rate of interest is uniform through the term hereof. If such
amortization, proration, allocation and spreading is not



                                       81
<PAGE>

permitted under applicable law, then such excess interest shall be cancelled
automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if
theretofore paid, shall be credited on the Notes (or, if the Notes have been
paid in full, refunded to Borrower). The terms and provisions of this Section
11.3 shall control and supersede every other provision of the Loan Documents.
The Loan Documents are contracts made under and shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, except that if at any
time the laws of the United States of America permit the Lenders to contract
for, take, reserve, charge or receive a higher rate of interest than is allowed
by the laws of the State of New York (whether such federal laws directly so
provide or refer to the law of any state), then such federal laws shall to such
extent govern as to the rate of interest which the Lenders may contract for,
take, reserve, charge or receive under the Loan Documents.

     Section 11.4 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of any Loan Document is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully
severable; the Loan Documents shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part thereof;
the remaining provisions thereof shall remain in full effect and shall not be
affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance
therefrom; and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there
shall be added automatically as a part of such Loan Document a provision as
similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
possible to be legal, valid and enforceable.

     Section 11.5 Reimbursement of Expenses. Borrower shall pay (i) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its
Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel
for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this
Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing
Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any Lender, including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement,
including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or
Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect
of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

     Section 11.6 Approvals; Third Parties; Conditions. All approval rights
retained or exercised by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect
to leases, contracts, plans, studies and other matters are solely to facilitate
the Lenders' credit underwriting, and shall not be deemed or construed as a
determination that the Lenders have passed on the adequacy thereof for any other
purpose and may not be relied upon by Borrower or any other Person. This
Agreement is for the sole and exclusive use of the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders, the Issuing Bank and Borrower and may not be enforced, nor relied upon,
by any Person other than the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
and Borrower. All conditions of the obligations of the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereunder, including the obligation to




                                       82
<PAGE>

make advances and issue Letters of Credit, are imposed solely and exclusively
for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and
their successors and assigns, and no other Person shall have standing to require
satisfaction of such conditions or be entitled to assume that the Lenders will
refuse to make advances or that the Issuing Bank will refuse to issue Letters of
Credit in the absence of strict compliance with any or all of such conditions,
and no other Person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a
beneficiary of such conditions, any and all of which may be freely waived in
whole or in part by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank
at any time in their sole discretion.

     Section 11.7 Lenders, Issuing Bank and Administrative Agent Not in Control;
No Partnership. None of the covenants or other provisions contained in this
Agreement shall, or shall be deemed to, give the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender the right or power to exercise control over the
affairs or management of Borrower, the power of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders being limited to the rights to exercise the
remedies referred to in the Loan Documents. The relationship between Borrower
and the Lenders and the Issuing Bank is, and at all times shall remain, solely
that of debtor and creditor. No covenant or provision of the Loan Documents is
intended, nor shall it be deemed or construed, to create a partnership, joint
venture, agency or common interest in profits or income between the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and Borrower or to create an
equity in any Property in the Administrative Agent or any Lender. The
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders neither undertake nor
assume any responsibility or duty to Borrower or to any other person with
respect to any Property or the Loans or the Letters of Credit, except as
expressly provided in the Loan Documents; and notwithstanding any other
provision of the Loan Documents: (1) none of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders is, or shall be construed as, a partner, joint
venturer, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other business associate or
participant of any kind of Borrower or its stockholders, members, or partners
and none of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders intends
to ever assume such status; (2) none of the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the
Administrative Agent shall in any event be liable for any Indebtedness, expenses
or losses incurred or sustained by Borrower; and (3) none of the Lenders, the
Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent shall be deemed responsible for or a
participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of Borrower or its stockholders,
members, or partners. The Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders
and Borrower disclaim any intention to create any partnership, joint venture,
agency or common interest in profits or income between the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank, the Lenders and Borrower, or to create an equity in any
Property in the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, or any
sharing of liabilities, losses, costs or expenses.

     Section 11.8 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to
this Agreement.

     Section 11.9 Successors and Assigns; Secondary Market Transactions.

          (1) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders, Borrower and the
Company (to the extent herein provided) and the respective successors and
permitted assigns, provided that neither Borrower nor any other Borrower Party
shall, without the prior written consent of the



                                       83
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and all of the Lenders, assign any
rights, duties or obligations hereunder.

          (2) Subject to Section 11.24, Borrower shall reasonably cooperate with
the Administrative Agent and each Lender in effecting any (a) sale of this
Agreement, the Mortgages, the Notes, the other Loan Documents, and any and all
servicing rights thereto, or any portions thereof, to one or more investors, (b)

management purposes, the Lenders may elect to divide the Loans into two or more
separate loans evidenced by separate promissory notes so long as the payment and
other obligations of Borrower are not effectively increased or otherwise
modified. Borrower agrees to cooperate with the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and to execute such documents as the Administrative Agent reasonably may
request to effect such division of the Loans.

          (1) Reserved.

          (2) Assignments by the Lenders. Each Lender may assign any of its
Loans, its Note, its Commitment and its participations in Letters of Credit (but
only with the consent of the Administrative Agent and, prior to the occurrence
of an Event of Default, the consent of Borrower, with the consent of the
Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided
that:

          (a) no such consent by the Administrative Agent shall be required in
     the case of any assignment to another Lender or an affiliate of a Lender;

          (b) except to the extent the Administrative Agent shall otherwise
     consent, any such partial assignment (other than to another Lender or an
     affiliate of a Lender) shall be in an amount at least equal to $10,000,000;

          (c) each such assignment (including an assignment to another Lender or
     an affiliate of a Lender) by a Lender of its Loans or Commitment shall be
     made in such



                                       88
<PAGE>

     manner so that the same portion of its Loans and Commitment is assigned to
     the respective assignee;

          (d) subject to the applicable Lender's compliance with the provisions
     of clauses (b) and (c) above, the Administrative Agent's consent to an
     assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned if
     (i) in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, such assignment
     is made to a reputable institutional investor with substantial experience
     in real estate lending and originating mortgage loans similar to the Loans,
     and a financial net worth of at least $100,000,000, (ii) such assignment is
     first offered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms and
     conditions a separate agency agreement among the Administrative Agent and
     the Lenders, and (iii) the provisions of clause (e) have been satisfied;
     and

          (e) upon execution and delivery by the assignee (even if already a
     Lender) to Borrower and the Administrative Agent of an Assignment and
     Acceptance pursuant to which such assignee agrees to become a "Lender"
     hereunder (if not already a Lender) having the Commitment and Loans
     specified in such instrument, and upon consent thereto by the
     Administrative Agent and Borrower to the extent required above, the
     assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise
     consented to by the Administrative Agent), the obligations, rights and
     benefits of a Lender hereunder holding the Commitment and Loans (or
     portions thereof) assigned to it (in addition to the Commitment and Loans,
     if any, theretofore held by such assignee) and the assigning Lender shall,
     to the extent of such assignment, be released from the Commitment (or
     portion thereof) so assigned. Upon each such assignment the assigning
     Lender shall pay the Administrative Agent a processing and recording fee of
     $3,500 and the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Administrative
     Agent's counsel incurred in connection therewith.

          (3) Participations. A Lender may sell or agree to sell to one or more
other Persons (each a "Participant") a participation in all or any part of any
Loans held by it, or in its Commitment or in its participation in any Letter of
Credit, provided that such Participant shall not have any rights or obligations
under this Agreement or any Note or any other Loan Document (the Participant's
rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set
forth in the agreements executed by such Lender in favor of the Participant).
All amounts payable by Borrower to any Lender under Section 2.11 in respect of
Loans held by it, its Commitment and interests in any Letter of Credit shall be
determined as if such Lender had not sold or agreed to sell any participations
in such Loans, Commitment and interests in any Letter of Credit and as if such
Lender were funding each of such Loans and Commitment or participation in any
Letter of Credit in the same way that it is funding the portion of such Loans
and Commitment or participation in any Letter of Credit in which no
participations have been sold. In no event shall a Lender that sells a
participation agree with the Participant to take or refrain from taking any
action hereunder or under any other Loan Document except that such Lender may
agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to (i) increase or extend the term of such Lender's
Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or
interest on the related Loan or Loans or any portion of any fee hereunder
payable to the Participant, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of
principal, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon, or any fee
hereunder payable to the



                                       89
<PAGE>

Participant, to a level below the rate at which the Participant is entitled to
receive such interest or fee (except that such Lender may, without such
Participant's consent, waive the requirement that interest be paid at the
Default Rate) or (v) consent to any modification, supplement or waiver hereof or
of any of the other Loan Documents to the extent that the same, under Section
11.2, requires the consent of each Lender.

          (4) Certain Pledges. In addition to the assignments and participations
permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.24 (but without
being subject thereto), any Lender may (without notice to Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and without payment of any fee) assign
and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Note to any Federal Reserve
Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any operating circular
issued by such Federal Reserve Bank, and such Loans and Note shall be fully
transferable as provided therein. No such assignment shall release the assigning
Lender from its obligations hereunder.

          (5) Provision of Information to Assignees and Participants. A Lender
may furnish any information concerning Borrower or any of its Affiliates in the
possession of such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants
(including prospective assignees and participants), provided that such assignees
and participants (including prospective assignees and participants) agree to
keep such information confidential in accordance with Section 11.17(2).

          (6) No Assignments to Borrower or Affiliates. Anything in this Section
11.24 to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any
interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to Borrower or any of its Affiliates
without the prior consent of each Lender.

     Section 11.25 Release. Each of Borrower and Guarantor releases, acquits and
forever discharges the Administrative Agent and each Lender and all
subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, employees,
servants, attorneys and representatives of the Administrative Agent and the
Lender, as well as their respective successors and assigns (hereinafter
collectively being referred to as the "Released Parties") of and from any and
all claims, demands, debts, losses, costs, expenses, proceedings, judgments,
damages, actions, causes of action, suits, contracts, agreements, obligations,
accounts, defenses, offsets and liabilities of any kind or character whatsoever,
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in contract or in tort, at law or in
equity, including, without limitation, such claims and defenses as fraud,
mistake, duress and usury, which the Borrower and/or the Guarantor ever had, now
have or might hereafter have against the Released Parties, or any of them,
jointly or severally, for or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever,
which relates to, is based on, or arises out of, by reason of or in connection
with, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any act, omission, fact,
circumstance or condition existing on or prior to the Closing Date in connection
with the origination, servicing, administration and/or collection of the Loans.

holders of more than five percent (5%) of any class of equity Securities of
Borrower, or with any Affiliate of Borrower which is not its Subsidiary, on
terms less favorable to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, than
those that might be obtained in an arm's length transaction at the time from
Persons who are not such a holder or Affiliate. Nothing contained in this
Section 12.6 shall prohibit (a) increases in compensation and benefits for
officers and employees of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which are

          (b) From and after the date hereof, the Company will not incur any
     Indebtedness or any other obligations or liabilities except (x) in its
     capacity as the general partner of Borrower in connection with transactions
     entered into in the ordinary course of business, and (y) Indebtedness, the
     net proceeds of which are contributed to Borrower simultaneously with the
     incurrence thereof by the Company.

          (c) From and after the date hereof, the Company will not retain any
     Net Offering Proceeds, and the same will be contributed by the Company to
     Borrower simultaneously with receipt thereof by the Company.

     such merger.

                                   ARTICLE 13

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     Section 13.1 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Lender hereby
appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and of the
other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent (which term as used in this
sentence and in Section 13.5 and the first sentence of Section 13.6 shall
include reference to its affiliates and its own and its affiliates' officers,
directors, employees and agents):

          (a) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly
     set forth in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents, and shall not
     by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document be a trustee for any
     Lender;

          (b) shall not be responsible to the Lenders for any recitals,
     statements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in
     any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document referred
     to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement or
     any other Loan Document, or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
     genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, any Note or
     any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or provided for
     herein or therein or for any failure by Borrower or any other Person to
     perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder; and

          (c) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be
     taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any other
     document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in
     connection herewith or therewith, except to the extent any such action
     taken or omitted violates the Administrative Agent's standard of care set
     forth in the first sentence of Section 13.5.


                                       94
<PAGE>

The Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact, and may
delegate all or any part of its obligations hereunder, to third parties and
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents,
attorneys-in-fact or third parties selected by it in good faith. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of a Note as the holder
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the assignment or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.

     Section 13.2 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telegram or
cable) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided
for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
hereunder or thereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Majority
Lenders, and such instructions of the Majority Lenders and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

     Section 13.3 Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Potential Default or Event of Default
unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or Borrower
specifying such Potential Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Potential Default or Event of
Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 13.7) take such
action with respect to such Potential Default or Event of Default and other
matters relating to the Loans as shall be directed by the Lenders in accordance
with a separate agreement entered into by the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders.

     Section 13.4 Rights as a Lender. With respect to GECC's Commitment and the
Loans made by it, GECC (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) in its
capacity as a Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder
as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the
context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. GECC (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) and its
affiliates (including CMF Capital Company, LLC) may (without having to account
therefor to any Lender) lend money to, make investments in and generally engage
in any kind of lending, trust or other business with Borrower (and any of its
Affiliates and any Persons acquiring Properties from Borrower and any of its
Affiliates) as if it were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and GECC and
its affiliates (including CMF Capital Company, LLC) may accept fees and other
consideration from Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

     Section 13.5 Standard of Care; Indemnification. In performing its duties
under the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent will exercise the same degree
of care as GECC normally exercises in connection with real estate loans in which
no syndication or participations are involved, but the Administrative Agent
shall have no further responsibility to any Lender



                                       95
<PAGE>

except as expressly provided herein and except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct which resulted in actual loss to such Lender, and, except to
such extent, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility to any Lender
for the failure by the Administrative Agent to comply with any of the
Administrative Agent's obligations to Borrower under the Loan Documents or
otherwise. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the
extent not reimbursed under Section 11.5, but without limiting the obligations
of Borrower under Section 11.5) ratably in accordance with the aggregate
principal amount of the Loans held by the Lenders (or, if no Loans are at the
time outstanding, ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments), for
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent (including by any Lender) arising out of or by reason of
any investigation in or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including,
without limitation, the costs and expenses that Borrower is obligated to pay
under Section 11.5, but excluding, unless a Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance
of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable
for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the Administrative
Agent's breach of its standard of care set forth in the first sentence of this
Section.

     Section 13.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of
Borrower and its Affiliates and decision to enter into this Agreement and that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or under any other Loan
Document. Subject to the provisions of the first sentence of Section 13.5, the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by Borrower of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or
to inspect the Project or the books of Borrower or any of its Affiliates. Except
for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to
be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder or as
otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any
credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or
business of Borrower or any of its Affiliates that may come into the possession
of the Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates.

     Section 13.7 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of the
Administrative Agent hereunder, and under the other Loan Documents, the
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or
refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive further
assurances to its satisfaction from the Lenders of their indemnification
obligations under Section 13.5 against any and all liability and expense that
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.



                                       96
<PAGE>

     Section 13.8 Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Lenders and Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint
a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a financial institution that has
(a) an office in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus of at
least $500,000,000, (b) knowledge and experience comparable to the resigning
Administrative Agent's knowledge and experience in the servicing of loans
similar to the Loans hereunder and (c) unless the successor Administrative Agent
is a Lender or an Event of Default exits and is continuing, been reasonably
approved of by the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation of the
retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (i) the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and (ii) the Majority Lenders shall perform the duties of the
Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made
by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each
Lender directly) until such time as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor
agent as provided for above in this Section 13.8. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or
retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged
therefrom as provided above in this Section 13.8). The fees payable by Borrower
to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. After
any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative
Agent, the provisions of this Article 13 and Section 11.5 shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.

     Section 13.9 Limitation on Liability of the Administrative Agent's, the
Issuing Bank's and the Lenders' Officers, Employees, etc. Any obligation or
liability whatsoever of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
which may arise at any time under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall be satisfied, if at all, out of the Administrative Agent's, the Issuing
Bank's or such Lender's respective assets only. No such obligation or liability
shall be personally binding upon, nor shall resort for the enforcement thereof
be had to, the property of any of the Administrative Agent's, the Issuing Bank's
or any Lender's shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents,
regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of contract,
tort or otherwise.

GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, as Administrative
Agent, having an office at 125 Park Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10017
(the "Mortgagee"), and ________________________________________ having an office
at _____________________________,________, __________ (the "Tenant");

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS the Mortgagee is the present owner and holder of a certain
mortgage, mortgages, deed of trust or deeds of trust (the "Mortgage")
encumbering the premises located in the County of ___________, City and State of
__________, ____, known as __________________________ (the "Premises") which
Premises are more fully described in the attached Exhibit A;

     WHEREAS the Tenant is the holder of a leasehold estate in a portion of the
Premises under and pursuant to the provisions of a certain lease dated
___________________________ by and between_____________________________
________________________________________________________ (the "Lease"); and

     WHEREAS the Tenant has agreed to subordinate the Lease to the Mortgage and
to the lien thereof and the Mortgagee has agreed to grant non-disturbance to the
Tenant under the Lease on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of good and valuable consideration, the
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Mortgagee and the Tenant hereby
covenant and agree as follows:

     1. The Tenant agrees that the Lease and all of the terms, covenants and
provisions thereof and all rights, remedies and options of the Tenant thereunder
are and shall at all times continue to be subject and subordinate in all
respects to the Mortgage and all of the



                                      E-1
<PAGE>

terms, covenants and provisions thereof and to the lien thereof and to any and
all increases, renewals, modifications, spreaders, consolidations, replacements
and extensions thereof, and to any and all sums secured thereby, with the same
force and effect as if the Mortgage had been executed, delivered and recorded
prior to the execution and delivery of the Lease.

     2. The Mortgagee agrees that if any action or proceeding is commenced by
the Mortgagee to foreclose the Mortgage or to sell the Premises, the Tenant
shall not be named as a party in any such action nor shall the Tenant be named a
party in connection with any sale of the Premises, provided that at the time of

thereof, (ii) the Tenant shall be in possession of the premises demised under
the Lease, (iii) the Lease shall be in full force and effect, and (iv) the
Tenant shall not be in default under any of the terms, covenants or conditions

be made a party thereto as a condition to proceeding against the Landlord or
protecting such rights and remedies. In the latter case, the Mortgagee may join
the Tenant as a defendant in such action only for such purposes and not to
terminate the Lease.

     3. The Tenant agrees that if the Mortgagee or any successors in interest to
the Mortgagee shall become the owner of the Premises by reason of the
foreclosure of the Mortgage or the acceptance of a deed or assignment in lieu of
foreclosure or otherwise, the Lease shall not be terminated or affected thereby
but shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between the
Mortgagee and the Tenant upon all of the terms, covenants and conditions set
forth in the Lease and in that event the Tenant agrees to attorn to the
Mortgagee and the Mortgagee agrees to accept such attornment, provided, however,
that the provisions of the Mortgage shall govern with respect to the disposition
of any casualty insurance proceeds or condemnation awards and the Mortgagee
shall not be (i) obligated to complete any construction work required to be done
by the Landlord (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to the provisions of the Lease
or to reimburse the Tenant for any construction work done by the Tenant, (ii)
liable for any accrued obligation of the Landlord, or for any act or omission of
the Landlord, whether prior to or after such foreclosure or sale, (iii) liable
under any indemnity provision of whatever nature contained in the Lease,
including, but not limited to, any environmental indemnification, (iv) required
to make any repairs to the Premises and/or to the premises demised under the
Lease as a result of fire or other casualty or by reason of condemnation, (v)
required to make any capital improvements to the Premises and/or to the premises
demised under the Lease which the Landlord may have agreed to make, but had not
completed, or to perform or provide any services not related to possession or
quiet enjoyment of the premises demised under the Lease, (vi) subject to any
offsets, claims or counterclaims which shall have accrued to the Tenant against
the Landlord prior to the date on which the Mortgagee or its successor in
interest shall become the owner of the Premises or, (vii) liable for any
security deposit or other monies not actually received by the Mortgagee.

     4. The Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee
(i) enter into any agreement amending, modifying or terminating the Lease, (ii)
prepay any of the rents, additional rents or other sums due under the Lease for
more than one (1) month in advance



                                      E-2
<PAGE>

of the due date thereof, (iii) voluntarily surrender the premises demised under
the Lease or terminate the Lease without cause or shorten the term thereof, or
(iv) assign the Lease or sublet the premises demised under the Lease or any part
thereof; and any such amendment, modification, termination, prepayment,
voluntary surrender, assignment or subletting, without the prior written consent
of the Mortgagee shall not be binding on the Mortgagee.

     5. The Tenant hereby represents and warrants to the Mortgagee that as of
the date hereof (i) the Tenant is the owner and holder of the tenant's interest
under the Lease, (ii) a true and complete copy of the Lease is annexed hereto
and made a part hereof as Exhibit A and the Lease has not been modified or
amended, (iii) the Lease is in full force and effect and the term thereof
commenced on ____________________________, pursuant to the provisions thereof,
(iv) the premises demised under the Lease have been completed and the Tenant has
taken possession of the same on a rent paying basis, (v) neither the Tenant nor
the Landlord is in default under any of the terms, covenants or provisions of
the Lease and the Tenant to the best of its knowledge knows of no event which
but for the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute an
event of default by the Tenant or the Landlord under the Lease, (vi) neither the
Tenant nor the Landlord has commenced any action or given or received any notice
for the purpose of terminating the Lease, (vii) all rents, additional rents and
other sums due and payable under the Lease have been paid in full and no rents,
additional rents or other sums payable under the Lease have been paid for more
than one (1) month in advance of the due dates thereof, (viii) there are no
offsets or defenses to the payment of the rents, additional rents, or other sums
payable under the Lease and (ix) Tenant has received no notice of a prior
assignment, hypothecation or pledge of the Lease or the rents, income, deposits
or profits arising thereunder, except in favor of The Chase Manhattan Bank, as
agent.

     6. The Tenant shall notify the Mortgagee of any default by the Landlord
under the Lease or any other circumstance which would entitle the Tenant to
cancel or terminate the Lease or abate the rents, additional rents or other sums
payable thereunder, and agrees that, notwithstanding any provisions of the Lease
to the contrary, no notice of cancellation, termination or abatement thereof
shall be effective unless the Mortgagee shall have received notice of the
default or other circumstance giving rise to such cancellation, termination or
abatement and shall have failed within sixty (60) days after receipt of such
notice to cure such default or remedy such circumstance, or if such default
cannot be cured within sixty (60) days, shall have failed within sixty (60) days
after receipt of such notice to commence and to thereafter diligently pursue any
action necessary to cure such default or remedy such circumstance, as the case
may be.

     7. Anything herein or in the Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, in the
event that the Mortgagee shall acquire title to the Premises, or shall otherwise
become liable for any obligations of the Landlord under the Lease, the Mortgagee
shall have no obligation, nor incur any liability, beyond the Mortgagee's then
interest, if any, in the Premises and the Tenant shall look exclusively to such
interest of the Mortgagee, if any, in the Premises for the payment and discharge
of any obligations imposed upon the Mortgagee hereunder or under the Lease and
the Mortgagee is hereby released or relieved of any other liability hereunder
and under the Lease. The Tenant agrees that with respect to any money judgment
which may be obtained or secured




                                      E-3
<PAGE>

by the Tenant against the Mortgagee, the Tenant shall look solely to the estate
or interest owned by the Mortgagee in the Premises and the Tenant will not
collect or attempt to collect any such judgment out of any other assets of the
Mortgagee.

     8. Tenant shall neither suffer not itself manufacture, store, handle,
transport, dispose of, spill, leak or dump any toxic or hazardous waste, waste
products or substance (as they may be defined in any federal or state statute,
rule or regulation pertaining to or governing such wastes, waste products or
substances) on the Premises at any time during the term, or extended term, of
