(1) Loans hereunder shall be in USD and in an aggregate minimum amount  equal to the Applicable Minimum Amount and, in each case, integral multiples equal to  the Applicable Integral Multiple in excess of  that amount.   (2) Whenever the Borrower desires that Lenders make Credit Extensions,  the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Collateral Agent  and the Collateral Administrator) a fully executed Funding Notice no later than 10:00 a.m.  (New York City time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed Credit Date  (the &#8220;Required Notice Time&#8221;)), or such period shorter as may be agreed by the  Requisite Lenders and the Administrative Agent; provided that, in each case, with respect  to any Loan (Revolver) requested in connection with the Borrower funding a Delayed  Drawdown Collateral Obligation or Revolving Collateral Obligation, the Borrower may  deliver to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Collateral Agent and the Collateral  Administrator) a fully executed Funding Notice after the Required Notice Time so long as  such Funding Notice is delivered no later than the earlier of (x) 10:00 a.m. (New York City  time) on the proposed Credit Date and (y) within 1 Business Day of  receiving a request  by the underlying obligor to fund such Delayed Drawdown Collateral Obligation or  Revolving Collateral Obligation.  (3) [Reserved].  (4) For each Credit Extension, the Administrative Agent shall notify the  Borrower, the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator and each Lender of  the  principal amount of the Loans to be made along with each Lender&#8217;s respective Pro Rata  Shares thereof  (which Pro Rata Shares shall be equal to the Loan amount that each  Lender will be obligated to fund to the Borrower on the related Credit Date).  Such notice  shall be provided by the Administrative Agent with reasonable promptness, but not later  than, (i) with respect to any Credit Extension for which the funding notice was provided by  the borrower prior to the Required Notice Time, 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on such  Credit Date or (ii) with respect to any Credit Extension for which the funding notice was  provided by the borrower on or af ter the Required Notice Time, 12:00 p.m. (New York  City time) on such Credit Date. With respect to any Credit Extension for which the funding  notice was provided by the borrower on or af ter to the Required Notice Time, the  Administrative Agent shall be deemed to satisfy its duties under this clause (4) if  it makes  commercially reasonable efforts to provide such notice by 12:00 p.m. (New York City  time) on such Credit Date and, if it has not provided notice by such time, by providing  notice reasonably promptly thereaf ter.  (5) For each Credit Extension, each Lender shall make the amount of  its  Loans available to the Administrative Agent not later than (i) with respect to any Credit  Extension for which the funding notice was provided by the borrower prior to the  Required Notice Time, 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Credit Date and (ii) with  respect to any Credit Extension for which the funding notice was provided by the  borrower on or after to the Required Notice Time, 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the  related Credit Date, in each case by wire transfer of  same day funds in USD at the  principal of f ice designated by the Administrative Agent.  With respect to any Credit  Extension for which the funding notice was provided by the borrower on or af ter to the  Required Notice Time, each Lender shall be deemed to satisfy its duties under this  clause (5) if  it makes commercially reasonable efforts to deposit funds on or by the time  set forth in this clause (5) and, if it has not done so by such time, by depositing funds  reasonably promptly thereafter. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent  specified herein, the Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of the Loans available  to the Borrower on such Credit Date by causing an amount of  same day funds to be  deposited in, (a) for Loans (Term Loan), the Principal Collection Account and, (b) for    57  Loans (Revolver), the Unfunded Reserve Account, in each case for application of  such  proceeds in accordance with Section 2.3 or as otherwise agreed between the  Administrative Agent and the Borrower.   (6) If  a funding does not occur on any Credit Date because any condition  precedent to such requested borrowing herein specif ied has not been met or not all  Lenders have made their respective Loans on such date, then the Administrative Agent  shall return any amounts received to the respective Lenders without interest.   (d) [Reserved].  (e) Notices.  Each Funding Notice shall be executed by an Authorized Officer of  the  Borrower in a writing delivered to the Administrative Agent.

In the event of a discrepancy between the  telephone notice and the written Funding Notice, the written Funding Notice shall govern.  Neither the  Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to the Borrower in acting upon any telephonic  notice referred to above that the Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly  authorized officer or other person authorized on behalf of  the Borrower or for otherwise acting in good  faith.  2.2. Pro Rata Shares; Availability of Funds  (a) Pro Rata Shares.  All Loans shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and  proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender shall be  responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other Lender&#8217;s obligation to make a Loan  requested hereunder.  (b) Availability of Funds.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notif ied  by any Lender prior to the applicable Credit Date that such Lender does not intend to make available to  the Administrative Agent the amount of  such Lender&#8217;s Loan requested on such Credit Date, the  Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the  Administrative Agent on such Credit Date and the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but  shall not be obligated to, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount on such Credit Date.  If   the Administrative Agent has made such corresponding amount availab le to the Borrower but such  corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, then the  Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand f rom such  Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date until the date such amount is  paid to the Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by the Administrative Agent for the correction  of  errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.  If such Lender does not  pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the  Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall on or prior to the next  Payment Date pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent together with interest thereon,  for each day from such Credit Date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the  interest rate otherwise payable hereunder.  If  (1) the Administrative Agent declines to make a requested  amount available to the Borrower until such time as all applicable Lenders have made payment to the  Administrative Agent, (2) a Lender fails to fund to the Administrative Agent all or any portion of the Loans  required to be funded by such Lender hereunder prior to the time specif ied in this Agreement and (3)  such Lender&#8217;s failure results in the Administrative Agent failing to make a corresponding amount available  to the Borrower on the applicable Credit Date, then such Lender shall not receive interest hereunder with  respect to the requested amount of  such Lender&#8217;s Loans for the period commencing with the time  specified in this Agreement for receipt of payment by the Borrower through and including the time of  the    58  Borrower&#8217;s receipt of the requested amount and the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay interest on  any amounts not so advanced.  Nothing in this Section 2.2(b) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from  its obligation to fulfill its Commitments (Revolver) hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower  may have against any Lender as a result of  any default by such Lender hereunder.   2.3. Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of  the Loans made hereunder shall be used solely:   (a) solely with respect to the Loan (Term Loan), to repay in full the Existing Wells  Facility on the Closing Date  (b) to fund the Borrower&#8217;s payment of the costs and expenses payable hereunder  and under the Fee Letters (including the Upfront Fees payable on each Credit Date);   (c) to make deposits in one or more of  the Transaction Accounts as separately  agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (notice of which shall be provided to the Collateral  Agent and the Collateral Administrator);   (d)  to fund the Unfunded Reserve Account and Delayed Drawdown Collateral  Obligations and Revolving Collateral Obligations;   (e) to the extent of  the consideration in the form of  additional capital or equity  interests paid by the Borrower with respect to an asset contributed under the Borrower Sale and  Contribution Agreement, to make Equity Distributions in compliance with the requirements hereunder;  and  (f ) with the written consent of  the Administrative Agent, for any other purpose.   2.4.

Each Lender shall maintain on its internal records an  account or accounts evidencing the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lender, including the amounts  and currencies of the Loans made by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof .  Any  such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided that (1)  the failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrower&#8217;s  Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans; and (2) in the event of  any inconsistency between the  Register and any Lender&#8217;s records, the recordations in the Register shall govern.   (b) Register.  The Administrative Agent (or its agent or sub-agent appointed by it)  shall maintain at its Principal Off ice a register for the recordation of  the names and addresses of  the  Lenders, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the  terms hereof from time to time (the &#8220;Register&#8221;).  The Register shall be available for inspection by the  Borrower or any Lender (with respect to (1) any entry relating to such Lender&#8217;s Loans and (2) the identity  of  the other Lender&#8217;s (but not any information with respect to such other Lenders&#8217; Loans)) at any  reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  The Administrative Agent shall  record, or shall cause to be recorded, in the Register the Loans in accordance with the provisions of   Section 11.6, and each repayment or prepayment in respect of  the principal amount of  the Loans,  and  any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and each Lender, absent manifest  error; provided that failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect  any Lender&#8217;s Commitments (Revolver) or the Borrower&#8217;s Obligations in respect of  any Loan.  The  Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower&#8217;s non-f iduciary agent  solely for purposes of maintaining the Register as provided in this Section 2.4, and the Borrower hereby  agrees that, to the extent the Administrative Agent serves in such capacity, the Administrative Agent and  its of f icers, directors, employees, agents, sub-agents and af f iliates shall constitute &#8220;Indemnitees&#8221;.     59  (c) Notes.  If  so requested by any Lender by written notice to the Borrower (with a  copy to the Administrative Agent) at least two Business Days prior to the Initial Credit Date, or at any time  thereaf ter, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable and if so specif ied  in such notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender pursuant to Section 11.6) on the Initial  Credit Date (or, if  such notice is delivered af ter the Initial Credit Date, promptly af ter the Borrower&#8217;s  receipt of such notice) a Note or Notes to evidence such Lender&#8217;s Loans.  If  Notes are delivered to any  Lender, the Borrower may establish commercially reasonable procedures for replacing lost or stolen  Notes.  2.5. Interest on Loans.  (a) Interest Accruals.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, and subject to Section  2.5(b) below, each Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof  in relation to each  Interest Period from the date made through repayment (whether by acceleration or otherwise) thereof  at  an amount in USD equal to the sum of  the daily amounts during such Interest Period obtained by  multiplying (A) the Benchmark applicable to such Loan for such Interest Period from time to time plus the  Spread and (B) the Loan Amount for such day   (in relation to each Loan and each Interest Period the &#8220;Base Accrued Interest&#8221;).  (b) [Reserved].  (c) Interest Rate Determinations and Payments.  On each Payment Date, the  Borrower shall pay to Collateral Agent for distribution to the Lenders an amount equal to the sum of  the  Base Accrued Interest amounts determined in relation to each Loan for the related Payment Period (the  &#8220;Accrued Interest&#8221;), in accordance with the Priority of Payments.  As soon as practicable after 10:00 a.m.  (New York City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall determine  (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the  interest rates that shall apply to the Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the  applicable Interest Period (including the amounts set forth under clauses (a) and (b) above), and shall  promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower, the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator and each  Lender.  (d) Day-Count Fractions, Etc.  (1) Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.5(a) shall be computed on the  basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period  during which it accrues, except that any interest accruing at a Base Rate shall be  computed on the basis of a 365-day year.  In computing interest on any Loan, the date of  the making of such Loan or the first day of  an Interest Period applicable to such Loan  shall be included, and the date of  payment of  such Loan or the expiration date of  an  Interest Period applicable to such Loan shall be excluded; provided that, if  a Loan is  repaid on the same day on which it is made, no interest shall accrue or be paid on that  Loan.  (2) Except as otherwise set forth herein, interest on each Loan shall accrue  on a daily basis and shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, upon any  prepayment of that Loan, whether voluntary or mandatory, to the extent accrued on the  amount being prepaid and at maturity of the Loans, including final maturity of  the Loans,  in each case in accordance with the Priority of  Payments or otherwise as expressly  provided herein.

Payment or acceptance of  the increased rates of  interest provided for in this  Section 2.6 is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not in and of  itself  constitute a  waiver of  any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of any Secured Party.  2.7.

Each notice of  a Voluntary  Prepayment shall specify the principal amount to be prepaid and the related prepayment  date (which shall be a Business Day).  Upon the giving of any such notice, the principal  amount of  the Loans specif ied in such notice shall become due and payable on the  prepayment date specif ied therein.  (b) Voluntary Commitment Reductions (Revolver).  (1) The Borrower may, upon not less than three Business Days&#8217; prior written  notice to the Administrative Agent (which written notice the Administrative Agent will  promptly transmit by electronic means to each applicable Lender), at any time and f rom  time to time, terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part the Commitments  (Revolver) in an amount up to the amount by which the Commitments (Revolver) exceed  the Loan Amount (Revolver) at the time of such proposed termination or reduction (each,  a &#8220;Voluntary Commitment Reduction (Revolver)&#8221;); provided that  (x) any such partial reduction of the Commitments (Revolver) shall  be in an aggregate minimum amount of  $5,000,000 and integral multiples of   $1,000,000 in excess of  that amount;  (y) unless the Commitments (Revolver) will be terminated in whole,  no Default or Event of  Default has occurred and is continuing or would result  therefrom; and  (z) suf f icient amounts are on deposit in the Principal Collection  Account in the relevant Specified Currencies to pay the other amounts that will  be owing in connection therewith (including any related Make-Whole Amount).

Each Voluntary Commitment Reduction (Revolver) shall be accompanied by  payment of  the related Make-Whole Amount.  (d) Non-Waterfall Payments.  Voluntary Prepayments and payment of  amounts  under clause (c) above shall not be subject to the Priority of Payments but instead shall be made solely  out of Principal Proceeds or Interest Proceeds then on deposit in the Collection Account; provided that  Interest Proceeds shall not be applied to make Voluntary Prepayments or pay amounts under clause (c)  above unless, after giving effect to such payment, there shall be sufficient Interest Proceeds available in  the Interest Collection Account to make all payments of  interest in accordance with the Priority of   Payments on the next Payment Date, with any remaining unpaid amounts to be paid out of  Principal  Proceeds and Interest Proceeds thereafter received in the Transaction Accounts until paid in full, and all  amounts that continue to be owing on and after the next Payment Date shall be payable under the Priority  of  Payments.    62  2.9.

Not more than fifteen (15) days following the occurrence of  a Clean- Up Call Event, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in full (a &#8220;Clean-Up Call Prepayment&#8221;).  (c) Non-Waterfall Payments.  Neither a Clean-Up Call Prepayment nor a Portfolio  LTV Prepayment shall be subject to the Priority of  Payments but instead shall be made solely out of   Principal Proceeds or Interest Proceeds then on deposit in the Collection Account; provided that Interest  Proceeds shall not be applied to pay such amounts unless, after giving effect to such payment, there shall  be suf f icient Interest Proceeds available in the Interest Collection Account to make all payments of   interest in accordance with the Priority of Payments on the next Payment Date, with any remaining unpaid  amounts to be paid out of  Principal Proceeds and Interest Proceeds thereaf ter received in the  Transaction Accounts until paid in full, and all amounts that continue to be owing on and af ter the next  Payment Date shall be payable under the Priority of  Payments.

For purposes of  computing interest and fees, funds  deposited after that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by the Borrower on the  next succeeding Business Day.  (b) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day  that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be due on the next succeeding Business Day, and such  extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of Ancillary  Amounts hereunder.  (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments under this Agreement shall be  made on the Payment Dates in accordance with the Priority  of  Payments.  (d) If  an Event of  Default shall have occurred and not otherwise been waived or  cured, and the maturity of the Obligations shall have been accelerated pursuant to Section 9 or pursuant  to any sale of, any collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral, all payments  or proceeds received by Agents in respect of any of the Obligations shall be applied in accordance with  the Enforcement Priority of  Payments.  2.12. Ratable Sharing.  The Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if  any of  them shall, whether by  voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with the    63  terms hereof), through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker&#8217;s lien, by counterclaim or cross action  or by the enforcement of  any right under the Transaction Documents or otherwise, or as adequate  protection of  a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code or under analogous  provisions of any other Debtor Relief Law, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of  the aggregate  amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in respect of fees and other amounts then due and owing  to such Lender hereunder or under the other Transaction Documents (collectively, the &#8220;Aggregate  Amounts Due&#8221; to such Lender) that is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in  respect of  the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such  proportionately greater payment shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent and each other Lender of  the  receipt of such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations (which it shall  be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such  seller of  its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such  recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate  Amounts Due to them; provided that, if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by  such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization  of  the Borrower or otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such  participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent of  such recovery, but  without interest.  The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any  holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of  banker&#8217;s lien, co nsolidation,  set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by the Borrower to that holder with  respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of  the participation held by that holder.   The provisions of  this Section 2.12 shall not be construed to apply to (1) any payment made by the  Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of  this Agreement (including the  application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (2) any payment obtained by any  Lender as consideration for the assignment or sale of  a participation in any of  its Loans or other  Obligations owed to it.  2.13. Making or Maintaining Loans.  (a) Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate.  If  the Administrative Agent or any  Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be f inal and conclusive and binding upon all  parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Loans, that by reason of   circumstances af fecting the relevant interbank market, adequate and fair means do not exist for  ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the def inition of   &#8220;Benchmark&#8221;, the Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice to the Borrower and each Lender of  such determination, whereupon (i) such Loans shall bear interest at the applicable Base Rate plus the  Spread until such time as the Administrative Agent notif ies the Borrower and the Lenders that the  circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist or a Benchmark Replacement has been selected,  and (ii) any Funding Notice given by the Borrower with respect to such Loans shall be deemed to be  rescinded by the Borrower or, at the election of the Borrower, a request that such Loans be made bearing  interest based on the applicable Base Rate instead of  such applicable interest rate.   (b) Illegality or Impracticability of  Loans.  If  on any date (i) any Lender shall have  determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that  the making, maintaining, converting to or continuation of  its Loans has become unlawful as a result of   compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or  order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having  the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or (ii) Administrative  Agent is advised in writing by the Requisite Lenders (which determination shall be f inal and conclusive  and binding upon all parties hereto) that the making, maintaining, converting to or continuation of  their  Loans has become impracticable, as a result of  contingencies occurring af ter the Closing Date which  materially and adversely af fect the relevant interbank market or the position of  the Lenders in that  interbank market, then, and in any such event, such Lenders (or in the case of  the preceding clause (i),  such Lender) shall be an &#8220;Affected Lender&#8221; and such Affected Lender shall on that day g ive notice (by e- mail or by telephone conf irmed in writing) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of  such  determination (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  64  Administrative Agent receives a notice f rom (x) any Lender pursuant to clause (i) of  the preceding  sentence or (y) a notice f rom Lenders constituting Requisite Lenders pursuant to clause (ii) of  the  preceding sentence, then (A) the obligation of  the Lenders (or, in the case of  any notice pursuant to  clause (i) of  the preceding sentence, such Lender) to make additional Loans shall be suspended until  such time as such circumstances cease to exist (at which time such notice shall be withdrawn by each  Af fected Lender); (B) to the extent such determination by the Af fected Lender relates to a Loan then  being requested by the Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice, such Funding Notice shall be deemed to  be rescinded by the Borrower (or, at the election of the Borrower, be deemed to be a request that such  Loan be made bearing interest based on the applicable Base Rate); (C) the Lenders&#8217; (or in the case of   any notice pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, such Lender&#8217;s) obligations to maintain their  respective outstanding Loans that bear interest based on the applicable interest rate (the &#8220;Affected  Loans&#8221;) shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of  the Interest Period then in ef fect  with respect to the Af fected Loans or when required by law, and (D) the Af fected Loans shall  automatically convert into Loans that bear interest at the applicable Base Rate plus the Spread per  annum on the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by  an Af fected Lender as described above relates to a Loan then being requested by the Borrower pursuant  to a Funding Notice, the Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions of  Section 2.13(c),  to  rescind such Funding Notice as to all Lenders by giving written or telephonic notice (promptly conf i rmed  by delivery of written notice thereof) to the Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which  the Af fected Lender gives notice of its determination as described above (which notice of  rescission the  Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender).  (c) Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement of  Interest Periods.  The  Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by such Lender (which request shall set  forth the basis for requesting such amounts), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including  any interest paid or payable by such Lender to Lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Loans  and any loss, expense or liability sustained by such Lender in connection with the liquidation o r  re-employment of such funds but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain as  a result of  any of  the following (each, a &#8220;Breakage Event&#8221;):  (1) if  for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a borrowing of any  Loan does not occur on a date specif ied therefor in a Funding Notice or a telephonic  request for borrowing;  (2) if  any prepayment or other principal payment of  any of  the Loans on a  date prior to the last day of  an Interest Period applicable to that Loan; or  (3) if  any prepayment of any of its Loans is not made on any date specif ied  in a notice of  prepayment given by the Borrower.  (d) Booking of Loans.  Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Loans at, to, or for  the account of  any of  its branch of f ices or the of f ice of  an Af f iliate of  such Lender.  (e) Assumptions Concerning Funding of Loans.  Calculation of all amounts payable  to a Lender under this Section 2.13 and under Section 2.14 shall be made as though such Lender had  actually funded each of  its relevant Loans through the purchase of  a deposit relating to such Loans  bearing interest at the applicable interest rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Loan and having  a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such deposit relating to  such Loans from an offshore office of  such Lender to a domestic of f ice of  such Lender in the United  States of America; provided that each Lender may fund each of its Loans in any manner it sees fit and the  foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this  Section 2.13 and under Section 2.14.  2.14. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy.  (a) Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes.  Subject to the provisions of   Section 2.15 (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), if  any Lender shall  determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all    65  parties hereto) that any Change in Law:  (1) subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending off ice) o r any  company controlling such Lender to any additional Tax (other than (A) Indemnif ied Taxes, (B) Taxes  described in clauses (b) through (d) of  the def inition of  Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income  Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits,  reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; (2) imposes, modif ies or holds applicable any  reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit,  liquidity, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or  other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other  acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements with  respect to Loans that are reflected in the determination of the interest rates) or any company controlling  such Lender; or (3) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or af fecting  such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or any company controlling such Lender or such Lender&#8217;s  obligations hereunder or the London interbank market; and the result of  any of  the foregoing is to  increase the cost to such Lender of  agreeing to make, making or maintaining Loans hereunder or to  reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending of f ice) with respect  thereto; then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of  the  statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the form of  an  increased rate of, or a different method of  calculating, interest or in a lump sum or otherwise as such  Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any  such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder; provided that such  compensation shall be due and payable only if such Lender is charging similarly situated borrowers for  similar costs, damages, losses or expenses at such time.  Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with  a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for  calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.14(a), which statement shall  be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.   (b) Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Adjustment.  If  any Lender shall have determined  (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be f inal and conclusive and binding upon all parties  hereto) that (1) any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or (2) compliance by any  Lender (or its applicable lending office) or any company controlling such Lender with any Change in Law  regarding capital adequacy or liquidity, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of  return on the  capital of such Lender or any company controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to,  such Lender&#8217;s Loans, or participations therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans to  a level below that which such Lender or such controlling company could have achieved but for such  Change in Law (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling company with  regard to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt by  the Borrower f rom such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, the Borrower shall pay  to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling  company on an after-tax basis for such reduction.  Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy  to the Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating  the additional amounts owed to Lender under this Section 2.14(b), which statement shall be conclusive  and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.   (c) Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of  any Lender to demand  compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s right to demand such  compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this  Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date  that such Lender notif ies the Borrower of  the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or  reductions, and of such Lender&#8217;s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if  the Change in  Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to  above shall be extended to include the period of  retroactive ef fect thereof).   2.15. Taxes; Withholding, Etc.  (a) Payments to Be Free and Clear.  All sums payable by or on behalf of  any Credit  Party hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents shall be paid free and clear of, and without    66  any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax, unless such deduction or withholding is required by  law.  (b) Withholding of  Taxes.  If  any Credit Party or any other Person (acting as a  withholding agent) is (in such withholding agent&#8217;s reasonable good faith discretion) required by law to  make any deduction or withholding on account of  any such Tax f rom any sum paid or payable by any  Credit Party to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of the Transaction Documents:  (1) the  Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of  any such requirement or any change in any such  requirement as soon as the Borrower becomes aware of  it; (2) the Borrower shall pay, or cause to be  paid, any such Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if  the  liability to pay is imposed on any Credit Party) for its own account or (if  that liability is imposed on the  Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be) on behalf  of  and in the name of  the  Administrative Agent or such Lender; (3) and, if  such Tax is an Indemnif ied Tax, unless o therwise  provided in this Section 2.15, the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of  which the relevant  deduction or withholding is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, af ter the  making of that deduction or withholding (including any such deductions or withholdings applicable to  additional amounts payable under this Section 2.15), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the  case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such  deduction or withholding been made; and (4) within thirty days af ter the payment of  any Tax which it is  required by clause (2) above to pay, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or  a certif ied copy of a receipt issued by the relevant taxing authority evidencing such payment, a copy of   the return reporting such payment or other evidence of  such deduction or withholding and of  the  remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative  Agent.

If  any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith,  that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnif ied pursuant to this Section  2.15 (including additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an  amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.15  with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes)  of  such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental  Authority with respect to such refund).

Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an  indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party  in a less favorable net af ter-Tax position than the indemnif ied party would have been in if  the  indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.

A certificate as to the amount of any such expenses payable by the Borrower pursuant to this  Section 2.16 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount) submitted by such  Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent manifest  error.  2.17.

Any removal of Goldman  Sachs or its successor as a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section shall also constitute the removal of  Goldman Sachs or its successor as the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.7.  2.19.

All investment or application of funds in accordance with Section 6.2 or 6.3 shall be made  pursuant to a Borrower Order (which may be in the form of  standing instructions) executed by an  Authorized Officer of the Collateral Manager.  The Borrower shall at all times direct the Collateral Agent or  the Accounts Securities Intermediary, as applicable to, and, upon receipt of  such Borrower Order, the  Collateral Agent or the Accounts Securities Intermediary shall, invest or cause the investment of, pending  application in accordance with Section 6.2 or 6.3, all funds received into the Transaction Accounts (other  than the Payment Account and the Collateral Account) during a Due Period (except when such funds  shall be required to be disbursed hereunder), and amounts received in prior Due Periods and retained in  any Transaction Account, as so directed, in Eligible Investments.  If , prior to the occurrence of an Event of  Default, the Borrower shall not have given any such investment directions, the Collateral Agent shall seek  instructions from the Borrower within three Business Days after transfer of such funds to the applicable  Transaction Account.  If  the Collateral Agent does not thereupon receive written instructions f rom the  Borrower within five Business Days af ter transfer of  such funds to such Transaction Account, it shall  invest and reinvest the funds held in such Transaction Account, as fully as practicable, but only in one or  more Eligible Investments maturing (as selected by the Collateral Manager in a writing delivered to the  Collateral Agent) no later than the third Business Day prior to the next Payment Date unless such Eligible  Investments are issued by the Bank, in which event such Eligible Investments may mature up to the  Business Day preceding such Payment Date.  Af ter the occurrence and during the continuance of  an  Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall invest and reinvest, or cause the investment or reinvestment    90  of , such monies as fully as practicable in Eligible Investments (as selected by the Collateral Manager in a  writing delivered to the Collateral Agent) maturing not later than the earlier of (1) 30 days after the date of   such investment or (2) the third Business Day prior to the next Payment Date unless such Eligible  Investments are issued by the Bank, in which event such Eligible Investments may mature on the  Payment Date.  All interest and other income from such Eligible Investments shall be deposited into the  applicable Transaction Accounts and transferred to the Interest Collection Account, and any gain realized  f rom such investments shall be credited to the Interest Collection Account, and any loss resulting f rom  such investments shall be charged to the Interest Collection Account.  In the absence of  any direction  (including a standing direction) from the Collateral Manager the Collateral Agent shal l hold uninvested  any amounts held as USD and on deposit in any Transaction Account.  Except as otherwise provided  herein, the Collateral Agent shall not in any way be held liable by reason of any insuff iciency of  funds in  any Transaction Account resulting from any loss relating to any such investment; and the Collateral Agent  shall not be under any obligation to invest any funds held hereunder except as otherwise expressly set  forth herein.   If  any amounts received by any Borrower Entity (other than the Bo rrower) are to be  included as Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds for distribution on a Payment Date or other  application by the Collateral Agent permitted by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,  the Borrower shall cause such other Borrower Entities to remit to the Collateral Agent on the Borrower&#8217;s  behalf  any such Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds received by such entity, which remittance shall,  for amounts intended to be distributed on a Payment Date, occur not later than the Business Day  immediately succeeding the end of the related Due Period (or, to the extent that any such amounts are  intended for any other application under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, such  remittance shall occur suf f iciently in advance of  such anticipated application as may be reasonably  necessary).  For the avoidance of doubt, any such amounts received by such other Borrower Entities on  or prior to the Determination Date shall be treated as having been received during the related Due Period,  notwithstanding the remittance to the Collateral Agent as instructed by and in consultation with the  Collateral Manager of such amounts occurs following such Determination Date as described above.  The  Collateral Agent shall not have any liability for any failure to remit Interest Proceeds or Principal Proceeds  on a Payment Date (or otherwise apply any such amounts in accordance with this Agreement and the  other Transaction Documents) due to a failure or delay on the part of any such other Borrower Entity to  timely remit such amounts to the Collateral Agent on behalf  of  the Borrower.   If  the Borrower receives Cash denominated in currency that is not a Specif ied Currency  (regardless of source), the Collateral Agent, when and as directed by the Borrower (or the Collateral  Manager on its behalf), shall convert such amounts into USD at the prevailing spot rate of  exchange at  the time of such conversion.  The Borrower Entities shall bear all risks of investing in Pledged Obligations  denominated in a foreign currency.  It is understood and agreed that any foreign exchange transaction  ef fected by the Collateral Agent may be entered with the Bank or its af f iliates acting as principal or  otherwise through customary banking channels.  The Collateral Agent shall be entitled at all times to  comply with any legal or regulatory requirements applicable to currency or foreign exchange transactions.   The Borrower acknowledges that the Collateral Agent or any affiliates of the Collateral Agent involved in  any such foreign exchange transactions may make a margin or banking income f rom foreign exchange  transactions entered into pursuant to this section for which they shall not be required to account to the  Borrower or any of  its Af f iliates.    The Collateral Agent shall have no liability for any losses included in or resulting from the  rates obtained in any such exchange transaction in the absence of  its own gross negligence, willful  misconduct, f raud or bad faith.  The Collateral Agent, within one Business Day after becoming aware of the receipt of any  Distribution or other Proceeds that is not Cash, shall so notify the Borrower and the Collateral Manager  on behalf of the Borrower and the Borrower shall, within 10 Business Days of receipt of such notice f rom  the Collateral Agent, sell such Distributions or other Proceeds for Cash in an arm&#8217;s length transaction and  deposit the Proceeds thereof  in the Interest Collection Account or Principal Collection Account, as  relevant, for investment pursuant to Section 6.2; provided that the Borrower need not sell such    91  Distributions or other Proceeds if it delivers an Officer&#8217;s Certificate to the Collateral Agent certifying that  such Distributions or other Proceeds constitute Collateral Obligations or Eligible Investments and that all  steps necessary to cause the Collateral Agent to have a perfected lien therein that is of f irst priority, f ree  of  any adverse claim or the legal equivalent thereof (subject to Permitted Liens), as applicable, have been  taken.  The Collateral Agent shall give the Borrower and the Administrative Agent notice as soon  as practicable under the circumstances if it becomes aware that any Transaction Account or any funds on  deposit therein, or otherwise to the credit of any Transaction Account, shall become subject to any writ,  order, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process.  The Borrower Entities shall not  have any legal, equitable or beneficial interest in any Transaction Account other than in accordance with  the provisions of  this Agreement and the Securities Account Control Agreement.

For the  avoidance of doubt, Interest Proceeds received during a Due Period and committed to be converted by  the related Determination Date as described above shall continue to be treated as having been received  in such Due Period, notwithstanding that the settlement of the currency exchange may occur af ter such  Determination Date (provided that such settlement occurs no later than the Business Day immediately  preceding the related Payment Date). Pursuant to a Borrower Order, the Borrower (or the Collateral  Manager on its behalf) may from time to time direct, with 2 Business Days&#8217; prior notice, the Collateral  Agent to convert any such non-USD amounts into USD or vice versa and for the proceeds of  such  conversion to be deposited in the Interest Collection Account or the applicable subaccounts for  application pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein, and at any time, if  an Event of  Default  has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral Agent may (at the direction of  the Administrative Agent)  convert any or all of  such non-USD amounts into USD or vice versa for application hereunder.   To the extent that any Interest Proceeds are received in a Specified Currency other than  USD, the Collateral Agent will cause such Interest Proceeds to be deposited in the subaccount of  the  Interest Collection Account established for such currency (or in such other account as the Collateral  Agent may have established to hold such currency for purposes of  this Agreement and the other  Transaction Documents).  All monies deposited from time to time in the Interest Collection Account pursuant to this  Agreement shall be held by the Collateral Agent as part of  the Collateral and shall be applied to the  purposes provided herein.  </FONT></DIV>

No Borrower Entity will have the right or ability to Acquire Collateral  Obligations from any Affiliate except for Acquisitions from Affiliates conducted on terms and conditions  consistent with those of an arm&#8217;s length transaction at fair market value.  Neither the Collateral Agent nor  the Collateral Administrator shall have any obligation to verify compliance with this Section 8.3.   8.4. Purchase and Delivery of Collateral Obligations and Other Actions.   (a) Investment in Collateral Obligations.  The Borrower Entities may not invest the  net proceeds of  borrowings hereunder to Acquire any Collateral Obligation; however, the Borrower  Entities may Acquire Collateral Obligations through cashless contributions from the Equity Holder if  such  Acquisition compiles with the conditions in this Section 8.

(a) In the performance of its obligations hereunder, so long as no Event of  Default  shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf ) may enter  into any amendment, modification or waiver of, consent or supplement to, or inaction with respect to any  Underlying Instrument (each, an &#8220;Amendment&#8221;); provided that:    (1) [reserved]  (2) if , in the Borrower&#8217;s commercially reasonable discretion, such  Amendment constitutes a Material Modif ication,   (A) the Borrower shall use commercially reasonable ef forts to have  delivered to the Administrative Agent promptly (and in any case within f ive    113  Business Days of knowledge thereof) notice thereof , inc luding a summary of   such Amendment, and to the extent provided to the Borrower, copies of the near- f inal draf t documentation (each, a &#8220;Material Modification Draft Amendment  Package&#8221;); and  (B) following receipt of  such notice,  (x) the Administrative Agent may provide written notice to  the Borrower that the Administrative Agent has determined that such  Amendment is a Value Adjustment Event with respect to the related  Collateral Obligation; or  (y) if  the Administrative Agent has not responded within 5  Business Days, then such Amendment shall be deemed not to be a  Value Adjustment Event with respect to the related Collateral Obligation.   (3) if , in the Borrower&#8217;s commercially reasonable discretion, such  Amendment does not constitute a Material Modif ication, the Borrower shall us e  commercially reasonable efforts to have delivered to the Administrative Agent promptly  (and in any case within five Business Days of knowledge thereof) notice thereof , along  with a summary of  such Amendment (each, a &#8220;Non-Material Modification Draft  Amendment Package&#8221; and, together with any Material Modif ication Draf t Amendment  Package, a &quot;Draft Amendment Package&quot;).  (b) If  an Event of  Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (or the  Collateral Manager on its behalf) may not enter into any Material Modif ication unless the Administrative  Agent has otherwise consented to such Amendment in its sole and absolute discretion.  If  an Event of   Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from any such Amendment, the Adjusted Balance  of  any Collateral Obligation that is the subject of  a Material Modif ication for which the Administrative  Agent has not granted its consent shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.  (c) The Borrower (i) shall deliver executed copies of  all Amendments to the  Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days of the Borrower&#8217;s receipt of the executed version thereof ,   and if  such copies have not been delivered within 10 Business Days, the Adjusted Balance of  the  applicable Collateral Obligation shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion (and  shall not be subject to a Dispute) until such time as such copies are delivered, and (ii) such executed  documentation shall be consistent in all material respect with the documentation included in the Draf t  Amendment Package; otherwise, the Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, deem any  changes thereto to be Material Modifications (and such Amendment shall therefore be deemed to be a  Value Adjustment Event).

Each Lender hereby represents and warrants to the Borrower that it is a  Qualif ied Purchaser.  10.6. Right to Indemnity.

If  any indemnity  furnished to any Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of  such Agent, be insuf f icient or become  impaired, such Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts  indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished; provided that (1) in no event shall this  sentence require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage,  penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share  thereof ; and (2) this sentence shall not be deemed to require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against  any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement  described in the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence.  The foregoing shall survive the  termination of  this Agreement and the resignation or removal of  an Agent.   10.7. Successor Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the  Transaction Documents to the contrary, the Credit Parties, the Agents and each other Secured Party  hereby agree that (1) no Secured Party (other than the Collateral Agent) shall have any right to realize  upon any of the Collateral, it being understood and agreed that all such powers, rights and remedies  hereunder and under any of the Transaction Documents may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent  (at the written direction of the Requisite Lenders) for the benefit of the Secured Parties in accordance with  the terms hereof and thereof, and (2) in the event of a foreclosure or similar enforcement action by the  Collateral Agent (at the written direction of the Requisite Lenders) on any of  the Collateral pursuant to a  public or private sale or other Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363(k), Section 1129(b)(2)(a)(ii)  or otherwise of the Bankruptcy Code or under any analogous provisions of any other Debtor Relief  Law),  the Collateral Agent (or any Lender, except with respect to a &#8220;credit bid&#8221; pursuant to Section 363(k),  Section 1129(b)(2)(a)(ii) or otherwise of the Bankruptcy Code or such other Debtor Relief  Law) may be  the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such Disposition and the Collateral Agent,  as agent for and representative of  Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their  respective individual capacities) shall be entitled, upon instructions f rom the Requisite Lenders, for the  purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of  the  Collateral sold at any such Disposition, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of   the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such Dispositi on.    126  (c) Release of  Collateral, Termination of  Transaction Documents; Etc.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Transaction Document, when all  Obligations (other than contingent Obligations for which no claim has been asserted ) have been paid in  full and all Commitments (Revolver) have terminated or expired (as evidenced by an executed payof f   letter in substantially the form of Exhibit G (which the Administrative Agent shall cooperate with Borrower  reasonably and in good faith to prepare and execute) and confirmation from the Administrative Agent of   the receipt of  such payof f  amounts), the security interest created hereunder and under the other  Collateral Documents and all guarantee obligations under the Transaction Documents shall automatically  terminate and the Collateral Agent shall (at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower) take such actions  as shall be requested in writing by the Borrower to ef fect such release of  its security interest in all  Collateral and to release all guarantee obligations provided for in any Transaction Document.  The  Borrower shall prepare any such documentation at its expense and shall be responsible for the costs and  expenses of the Collateral Agent (including legal fees and expenses) in connectio n with any release  under this clause (c).  Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision  that such guarantee obligations shall be reinstated if  af ter such release any portion of  any payment in  respect of  the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or  returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Credit Party, or  upon or as a result of the appointment of  a receiver, intervenor or conservator of , or trustee or similar  of f icer for, any Credit Party or any substantial part of  its property, or otherwise, all as though such  payment had not been made.  10.9.

Without duplication  of  the provisions of Section 2.15(g), if the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority  asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the  account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or  because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of  a change in circumstance which  rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, or if  the  Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this  Agreement without deduction of  applicable withholding Tax f rom such payment, such Lender shall  indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative  Agent as Tax or otherwise, together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs  and out-of -pocket expenses) incurred.  10.10. Administrative Agent May File Bankruptcy Disclosure and Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws relative to any  Credit Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due  and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of  whether the  Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered  (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:   (a) to f ile a verif ied statement pursuant to rule 2019 of  the Federal Rules of   Bankruptcy Procedure that complies with such rule&#8217;s disclosure requirements for entities representing  more than one creditor;  (b) to f ile and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing  and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to f ile such  other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of  the Lenders and the  Agents (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of  the Agents and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the  Agents under Transaction Documents allowed in such judicial proceeding); and     127  (c) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any  such claims and to distribute the same, and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trust ee, liquidator,  sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender  to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the  making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for  the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents and their respective  agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Agents under the Transaction Documents.  To the  extent that the payment of  any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of  the  Agents, their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Agents under the Transaction  Documents out of the estate in any such proceeding shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same  shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of , any and all distributions, dividends, money,  securities and other properties that the Lenders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in  liquidation or under any plan of  reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if  any assignment of  rights and  obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable  law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of  such  interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of  this Agreement  until such compliance occurs.  (e) Representations and Warranties of Assignee.

(f ) Ef fect of Assignment.

(g) Participations.  (1) Each Lender shall have the right at any time to sell one or more  participations to any Person (other than any Ineligible Assignee (except for following the  occurrence and during the continuance of  an Event of  Default), a Credit Party, any  Af filiate of a Credit Party or any Natural Person) in all or any part of  its Commitments  (Revolver), Loans or in any other Obligation.  Each Lender that sells a participation  pursuant to this Section 11.6(g) shall, acting solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes  as a non-f iduciary agent of  the Borrower, maintain a register on which it records the  name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of   each participant&#8217;s participation interest with respect to the Loans (each, a &#8220;Participant  Register&#8221;); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any  portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any participant  or any information relating to a participant&#8217;s interest in any Commitments (Revolver),  Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that the relevant  parties, acting reasonably and in good faith, determine that such disclosure is necessary  to establish that such Commitment (Revolver), Loan or other Obligation is in registered  form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in  the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall  treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of  a  participation with respect to the Loan for all purposes under this Agreement,  notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of  doubt, the  Administrative Agent (in its capacity as the Administrative Agent) shall have no  responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (2) The holder of any such participation, other than an Affiliate of the Lender  granting such participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to  take any action hereunder except with respect to any amendment, modification or waiver  that would (A) extend the final scheduled maturity of  any Loan, or Note in which such  participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or  fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of  applicability of  any post-default  increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount  of  the participant&#8217;s participation over the amount thereof  then in ef fect (it being  understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in  the Commitment (Revolver) shall not constitute a change in the terms of  such  participation, and that an increase in any Commitment (Revolver) or Loan shall be  permitted without the consent of any part icipant if  the participant&#8217;s participation is not  increased as a result thereof), (B) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Credit  Party of  any of  its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (C) release all or  substantially all of the Collateral under the Collateral Documents (in each case, except as  expressly provided in the Transaction Documents) supporting the Loans hereunder in  which such participant is participating.  (3) The Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the  benef its of Sections 2.13(c), 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if  it were a Lender and  had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (c) of  this Section;  provided that (x) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under  Section 2.14 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with  respect to the participation sold to such participant, except to the extent such entitlement  to receive a greater payment results f rom a Change in Law that occurs af ter such  participant acquired the participation or unless the sale of  the participation to such    135  participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent; (y) a participant shall not be  entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation  sold to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benef it of  the Borrower, to  comply with Section 2.15 as though it were a Lender; and (z) except as specif ically set  forth in clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence, nothing herein shall require any notice to the  Borrower or any other Person in connection with the sale of  any participation.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE  RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING  HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS  BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE  LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED.  THE SCOPE OF THIS  WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE  FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION,  INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER  COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.  EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS  WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH  HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH  WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS.

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged with  respect to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the  nature of  interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.  If  the rate of  interest  (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the  Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of  the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the  Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of  interest which  would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times  been in ef fect.  In addition, if  when the Obligations are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder    138  (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would  have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in  ef fect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount  equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have  been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is  the intention of Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if   any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of   the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if  previously paid,  shall at such Lender&#8217;s option be applied to the outstanding amount of  the Loans made hereunder or be  refunded to the Borrower.  11.18. Effectiveness; Counterparts.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of  a counterpart hereof  by  each of  the parties hereto and receipt by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of written notification  of  such execution and authorization of delivery thereof.  This Agreement may be executed in any number  of  counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such  counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.  Delivery of  an executed  counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic format (i.e., &#8220;pdf&#8221; or &#8220;tif &#8221;)  shall be ef fective as delivery of  a manually executed counterpart of  this Agreement.   11.19. PATRIOT Act.  Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself  and not on behalf  of  any Lender)  hereby notifies each Credit Party that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is  required to  obtain, verify and record information that identif ies each Credit Party, which information includes the  name and address of  each Credit Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the  Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify such Credit Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.   11.20. Electronic Execution of Assignments.  The words &#8220;execution&#8221;, &#8220;signed&#8221;, &#8220;signature&#8221;, and words of like import in any Assignment  Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form,  each of  which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature  or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for  in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act,  the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the  Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Any electronically signed document delivered via email, facsimile or  other electronic communication from a person purporting to be an Authorized Officer shall be considered   signed or executed by such Authorized Officer on behalf of the applicable party.  The Bank Parties shall  have no duty to inquire into or investigate the authenticity or authorization of any such electronic signature  and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such electronic signature without any liability with respect  thereto.  11.21. No Fiduciary Duty.  Each Agent, Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph,  the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;), may have economic interests that conf lict with those of  the Credit Parties, their  stockholders and/or their affiliates.  Each Credit Party agrees that nothing in the Transaction Documents  or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or f iduciary or other  implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Credit Party, its stockholders or its affiliates,  on the other.  The Credit Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the transactions contemplated by the  Transaction Documents (including the exercise of  rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are  arm&#8217;s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Credit Parties, on  the other, and (b) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has  assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Credit Party, its stockholders or its affiliates    139  with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect  thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of  whether any Lender has advised, is currently  advising or will advise any Credit Party, its stockholders or its Af f iliates on other matters) or any other  obligation to any Credit Party except the obligations expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents and  (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or f iduciary of  any Credi t Party, its  management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person.  Each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees  that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is  responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process  leading thereto.  Each Credit Party agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory  services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Cred it Party, in connection  with such transaction or the process leading thereto.   11.22. Judgment Currency.  (a) The Credit Parties&#8217; obligations hereunder and under the other Transaction  Documents to make payments in each Specified Currency (each, for purposes herein, the &#8220;Obligation  Currency&#8221;) shall not be discharged or satisf ied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment  expressed in or converted into any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that  such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Secured Party entitled thereto of  the full  amount of  the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to it under this Agreement or the other  Transaction Documents.  If  for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any  Credit Party in  any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the  Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Judgment Currency&#8221;) an  amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the applicable exchange rate  thereof  as of  the day on which the judgment is given (such day being hereinaf ter referred to as the  &#8220;Judgment Currency Conversion Date&#8221;).  (b) If  there is a change in the rate of  exchange prevailing between the Judgment  Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, the Credit Parties jointly  and severally covenant and agree to pay, or cause to be paid, and each jointly and severally indemnif ies  the Secured Parties for such additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may be  necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of   exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of  the Obligation Currency that  could have been purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial  award at the rate or exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion Date.  The foregoing  indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent obligation of  the Credit Parties and shall survive  any termination of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and shall continue in full force  and ef fect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.  (c) For purposes of determining any rate of exchange for this Section 11.22, such  amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase of  the Obligation  Currency.  11.23. Confidentiality  (a) The Collateral Agent, the Collateral Administrator, the Collateral Custodian, the  Administrative Agent and each Lender will maintain the confidentiality of  all Conf idential Information to  protect Confidential Information delivered to such Person; provided that such Person may deliver or  disclose Confidential Information to:  (i) such Person&#8217;s directors, trustees, of f icers, employees, agents,  attorneys and af f iliates who agree to hold conf idential the Conf idential Information substantially in  accordance with the terms of this Section 11.23 and to the extent such disclosure is reasonably required  for the administration of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the matters contemplated  hereby or the investment represented by the Loans; (ii) such Person&#8217;s legal advisors, f inancial advisors  and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially  in accordance with the terms of  this Section 11.23 and to the extent such disclosure is reasonably  required for the administration of this Agreement, the matters contemplated hereby or the investment  </FONT></DIV>

In the event of any required disclosure of  the Conf idential  Information by such Lender, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality  of   the Conf idential Information.

Notwithstanding anything to  the contrary herein, the Collateral Custodian shall not be required to hold or accept  custody of any Custody Document hereunder to the extent such Custody Document is of   a type not approved for deposit into the custodial vault of  the Collateral Custodian;  provided that (1) the Collateral Custodian notifies the Collateral Manager and the Lenders  prior to refusing to hold such documents and (2) the failure of the Collateral Custodian to  accept and hold such documents shall not result in a default or an Event of  Default with  respect to the Borrower hereunder (provided that copies of  such documents shall have  been delivered by the Borrower to or otherwise made available to the Administrative  Agent). For the avoidance of  doubt, the Collateral Custodian shall not be required to  review or provide any certifications in respect of the Custody Documents provided to it.   (2) In taking and retaining custody of  any such Custody Documents, the  Collateral Custodian shall be deemed to be acting as the agent of  the Secured Parties;  provided that (x) the Collateral Custodian makes no representations as to the existence,  perfection, enforceability or priority of  any Lien on such Custody Documents or the  instruments therein or as to the adequacy or sufficiency of such Custody Documents; and  (y) the Collateral Custodian&#8217;s duties shall be limited to those expressly contemplated  herein.  (3) All Custody Documents required to be held by the Collateral Custodian  shall be kept in fire resistant vaults, rooms or cabinets at the Custodial Office and shall be  placed together with an appropriate identifying label and maintained in such a manner so  as to permit retrieval and access.

If  the Collateral Custodian receives  instructions from the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Manager or the Borrower which conf lict with any  instructions received by the Requisite Lenders (or the Administrative Agent on their behalf ) af ter the  occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Custodian shall rely on and  follow the instructions given by the Requisite Lenders.  After the occurrence and during the continuance  of  an Event of Default, the Collateral Custodian agrees to cooperate with the Administrative Agent and  the Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Requisite Lenders) (pursuant to a written request in the  form of Exhibit D) as requested in order to take any action that the Requisite Lenders deem necessary or  desirable in order for the Collateral Agent to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the security interests  granted by the Borrower Entities under the Transaction Documents, or to enable any of them to exercise  or enforce any of  their respective rights hereunder.    (f ) Requisite Lenders.  The Requisite Lenders may direct the Collateral Custodian to  take any action incidental to its duties hereunder.  With respect to other actions that are incidental to the  actions specifically delegated to the Collateral Custodian hereunder, the Collateral Custodian shall not be  required to take any such incidental action hereunder, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting  (and shall be fully protected in acting or ref raining f rom acting) upon the direction of  the Requisite  Lenders; provided that the Collateral Custodian shall not be required to take any action hereunder at the  request of the Requisite Lenders, any Secured Party or otherwise if  the taking of  such action, in the  reasonable determination of the Collateral Custodian, (x) shall be in violation of  any applicable law or  contrary to any provisions of  this Agreement or (y) shall expose the Collateral Custodian to liability  hereunder or otherwise (unless it has received indemnity which it reasonably deems to be satisfactory  with respect thereto).  If  the Collateral Custodian requests the consent of  the Requisite Lenders and the  Collateral Custodian does not receive a consent (either positive or negative) from the Requisite Lenders  within 10 Business Days of its receipt of such request, then the Requisite Lenders shall be deemed to  have declined to consent to the relevant action.  The Collateral Custodian may accept and act upon  directions provided by the Administrative Agent as if  such directions were provided by the Requisite  Lenders directly.  The Collateral Custodian shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by  it in accordance with the request or direction of  any Secured Party, to the extent that this Agreement  provides such Secured Party the right to so direct the Collateral Custodian.  The Collateral Custodian  shall not be deemed to have notice or knowledge of any matter hereunder, including an Event of Default,  unless an Authorized Officer of the Collateral Custodian has knowledge of  such matter or written notice  thereof  is received by the Collateral Custodian.    146  (g) Merger/Consolidation.  Any Person (a) into which the Collateral Custodian may  be merged or consolidated, (b) that may result from any merger or consolidation to which the Collateral  Custodian shall be a party or (c) that may succeed to the properties and assets of  the Collateral  Custodian substantially as a whole, which Person in any of the foregoing cases executes an agreement  of  assumption to perform every obligation of the Collateral Custodian hereunder, shall be the successor  to the Collateral Custodian under this Agreement without further act  of  any of  the parties to this  Agreement.  (h) Compensation.  As compensation for its Collateral Custodian activities  hereunder, the Collateral Custodian shall be entitled to compensation as set forth in the Bank Party Fee  Letter.

(i) Removal.  The Collateral Custodian may be removed, with or without cause, by  the Requisite Lenders by notice (with a copy to the Borrower and the Collateral Manager) given in writing  to the Collateral Custodian (the &#8220;Collateral Custodian Termination Notice&#8221;); provided that,  notwithstanding its receipt of a Collateral Custodian Termination Notice, the Collateral Custodian shall  continue to act in such capacity (and, for the avoidance of doubt, so long as it continues to act in such  capacity, shall continue to receive the compensation and any other amounts to which it is entitled to  receive in such capacity under the terms of  this Agreement and the Bank Party Fee Letter) until a  successor Collateral Custodian has been appointed (with the consent of  the Borrower so long as no  Event of  Default has occurred and is continuing) and has agreed to act as Collateral Custodian  hereunder.    (j) Reliance.  The Collateral Custodian may conclusively rely on and shall be fully  protected in acting upon any written notice, instruction, statement, certif icate, request, waiver, consent,  instrument, opinion, report, letter or other paper, electronic transmission or document furnished to it in  accordance with this Agreement, which it in good faith reasonably believes to be genuine and that has  been signed or presented by the proper party (which in the case of any instruction from or on behalf of the  Borrower shall be an Authorized Off icer) or parties in the absence of  its gross negligence, will ful  misconduct or bad faith of its duties hereunder.

The Collateral Custodian may rely conclusively on and shall be fully protected in  acting upon the written instructions of the Requisite Lenders in the absence of its gross negligence, willful  misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of  its duties hereunder.   (k) Rights of  the Collateral Custodian.  The Collateral Custodian may consult  counsel selected with due care and shall not be liable for any action taken, suf fered or omitted by it  hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of  such counsel.  The Collateral  Custodian shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any act done or step taken or omitted by it,  in good faith, or for any mistakes of fact or law, or for anything that it may do or ref rain f rom doing in  connection herewith except in the case of its own willful misconduct, bad faith, or gross negligence.   The  Collateral Custodian makes no warranty or representation and shall have no responsibility (except as  expressly set forth in this Agreement) as to the content, enforceability, completeness, validity, sufficiency,    147  value, genuineness, ownership or transferability of the Collateral, and will not be required to and will not  make any representations as to the validity or value (except as expressly set forth in this Agreement) of   any of  the Collateral.  The Collateral Custodian shall not be obligated to take any legal action hereunder  that might in its judgment involve any expense or liability unless it has been furnished with an indemnity  reasonably satisfactory to it.  The Collateral Custodian shall have no duties or responsibilities except such  duties and responsibilities as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no covenants or obligations  shall be implied in this Agreement against the Collateral Custodian.  The duties, obligations and  responsibilities of the Collateral Custodian shall be determined solely by the express provisions of  this  Agreement.  No implied duties, obligations or responsibilities shall be read into this Agreement against, or  on the part of, the Collateral Custodian.  Any permissive right of  the Collateral Custodian to take any  action hereunder shall not be construed as a duty.  The Collateral Custodian shall not be required to  expend or risk its own funds in the performance of  its duties hereunder.  It is expressly agreed and  acknowledged that the Collateral Custodian is not guaranteeing performance of or assuming any liability  for the obligations of  the other parties hereto or any parties to the Collateral.   (l) Request for Directions.  In case any reasonable question arises as to its duties  hereunder, the Collateral Custodian may request instructions f rom the Requisite Lenders, and shall be  entitled at all times to refrain from taking any action unless it has received instructions from the Requisite  Lenders.  The Collateral Custodian shall in all events have no liability, risk or cost for any action taken  pursuant to and in compliance with the instruction of  the Requisite Lenders.  In no event shall the  Collateral Custodian be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of  any kind  whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Collateral Custodian has been advised of   the likelihood of  such loss or damage and regardless of  the form of  action.  (m) Responsibilities.  The Collateral Custodian shall have no responsibilities or duties  with respect to any Custody Document while such Custody Document is not in its possession.
