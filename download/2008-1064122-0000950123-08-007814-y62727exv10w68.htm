restructuring proposal or make any subsequent loans or other financial accommodations to the SRGL
Parties. The Noteholders have not, directly or indirectly, encouraged any of the SRGL Parties to
anticipate or expect any favorable consideration of any future business plans or requests for
additional modifications, amendments or supplements of or to the Transaction Documents. The SRGL
Parties acknowledge and agree that Noteholders&#146; present objectives and goals may include, without
limitation, insistence upon the full, timely and strict compliance with all terms and conditions of
the Note Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents, and a refusal to
consider or accept any subsequent proposals for restructuring or modifications of the Note Purchase
Agreement, the Indenture or the other Transaction Documents. The SRGL Parties further acknowledge
