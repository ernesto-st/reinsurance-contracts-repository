Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) and Dean R. O&#146;Hare (the &#147;Executive&#148;) is dated
September&nbsp;18, 2002 (the &#147;Execution Date&#148;).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement. Effective as of the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the date that a
successor chief executive officer of the Company assumes office or (b)&nbsp;December
31, 2002, the Executive hereby retires and resigns as chief executive officer,
Chairman and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;),
and from all other positions (including as a member of the Company&#146;s
International Advisory Board) the Executive then holds as an employee, officer
or member of the board of directors of the Company, its subsidiaries or
affiliates (the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and the Company&#146;s
joint venture with American International Group, Inc. are hereinafter referred
to as the &#147;Affiliated Entities&#148;) and any other joint venture in which any of
the Affiliated Entities is a participant (the date on which the Executive&#146;s
resignation and retirement is effective pursuant to this sentence is
hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Retirement Date&#148;). Until the Retirement Date,
the Executive agrees that he shall devote his full business time and attention
to the business and affairs of the Company and the other Affiliated Entities,
comply fully with all laws and regulations applicable to him in connection with
his employment or service as an officer, director or employee of any of the
Affiliated Entities, conduct himself in accordance with all applicable written
policies of each of the Affiliated Entities and the ethical and moral standards
suitable for the chief executive of a major U.S. public company and use his
best efforts to promote the business and welfare of the Company, its
shareholders and the other Affiliated Entities.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation until Retirement Date. (a)&nbsp;Base Salary. Until the
Retirement Date, the Executive shall continue to receive his annual base salary
at the rate in effect as of the Execution Date, payable in accordance with the
Company&#146;s payroll practices as may be in effect from time to time.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Annual Bonus. With respect to the 2002 bonus plan year, the Executive
shall be paid an annual bonus (the &#147;Bonus&#148;) equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the
annual bonus the Executive would have earned, if any, for such year if the
Executive had been employed by the Company for the full plan year, which annual
bonus, if any, for purposes of this clause (i)&nbsp;shall be an amount equal to a
percentage of the Executive&#146;s target bonus for the 2002 bonus plan year that is
equal to the average percentage of the respective target bonuses (the
&#147;Average&#148;) paid to the executives who were in Band 9 with respect to annual
bonuses for the 2002 bonus plan year, and (ii)&nbsp;a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days from the commencement of the 2002 bonus plan year
until the Retirement Date, and the denominator of which is 365, such Bonus to
be paid to the Executive at such time and in such manner as annual bonuses for
such year are paid to executives of the Company generally. The Executive shall
not be eligible for any bonus with respect to any bonus plan year after 2002,
and in no event shall any bonus paid to any successor chief executive officer
be taken into account in determining the Average.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Company and its subsidiaries on the same terms and conditions as the
Executive was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Execution Date
(it being understood, however, that the Executive will not be entitled to
receive any new awards of stock options or other equity-based compensation
(including restoration options) or, except as provided in Section&nbsp;2(b) above,
other forms of incentive compensation).
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement Benefits. (a)&nbsp;Pension Credit. Subject to the Executive&#146;s
continued compliance with the provisions of Sections&nbsp;5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the
Executive shall be paid an aggregate amount (the &#147;Supplementary Pension
Payment&#148;) equal to (i)&nbsp;the sum of the lump sum actuarial equivalent of the
benefit under the Pension Plan of the Company (the &#147;Pension Plan&#148;) and the
Pension Excess Benefit Plan of the Company (the &#147;Excess Plan&#148;) that the
Executive would have received had the Executive received additional years of
age and service credit for five years after the Retirement Date, assuming for
this purposes that the Bonus is included in the Executive&#146;s &#147;Compensation&#148; (as
defined in Section&nbsp;1.16 of the Pension Plan) for 2002 under the Pension Plan
and the Excess Plan, minus (ii)&nbsp;the sum of the lump sum actuarial equivalent of
the Executive&#146;s actual benefit (paid or payable) under the Pension Plan and the
Excess Plan as of the Retirement Date (utilizing for each of clauses (i)&nbsp;and
(ii)&nbsp;the same actuarial assumptions as those in effect under the Pension Plan
and the Excess Plan, as applicable, immediately prior to the Execution Date).
The Supplementary Pension Payment shall be paid to the Executive, without
interest, in equal monthly installments during the five years following the
Retirement Date; provided, that for monthly installments paid to the Executive
prior to the determination of the Bonus, the Supplementary Pension Payment
shall be calculated in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;3(c) without regard to
the Executive&#146;s compensation for 2002; provided, further, that promptly
following the final determination of the amount of the Supplementary Pension
Payment at the March Meeting as provided in Section&nbsp;3(c), the Company will pay
to the Executive an amount, if any, equal to the aggregate shortfall in such
monthly installments based on the amount of the finally determined
Supplementary Pension Payment.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Stock Options. Following the Retirement Date, all of the Executive&#146;s
stock options granted by the Company to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s stock
(the &#147;Stock Options&#148;) that are outstanding and vested on the Retirement Date
shall remain exercisable in accordance with their terms. Any termination of
the Executive&#146;s employment (other than for death or Disability (as such term is
defined in the Company&#146;s long-term disability plan)) on or prior to the
Retirement Date shall be deemed to be termination of employment for retirement
with respect to the terms of any outstanding Stock Options. Subject to the
remainder of this Section&nbsp;3(b), following the Retirement Date, all of the Stock
Options, if any, that are outstanding and unvested on the Retirement Date shall
continue to vest in accordance with their terms as if the Executive had
remained employed by the Company, and once vested, shall remain exercisable in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding anything contained in the
immediately preceding sentence to the contrary, (i)&nbsp;Stock Options held by the
Executive that are unvested on the Retirement Date shall not continue to vest
and shall not be exercisable until the date on which both the Supplementary
Pension Payment and Black-Scholes values required to be determined under clause
(ii)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;3(b) have been determined (the &#147;Stock Option Determination
Date&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;on the Stock Option Determination Date, the Executive shall,
and hereby will, cease to be eligible to vest in a number of unvested Stock
Options (if there had been unvested stock options on the Retirement Date) with
a Black-Scholes value equal to the amount of the Supplementary Pension Payment,
or if the number of such unvested Stock Options has a

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Black-Scholes value less than the Supplementary Pension Payment, then the
Executive shall cease to be eligible to vest in all of such unvested Stock
Options. All Stock Options which shall no longer be eligible to vest as of the
Stock Option Determination Date shall terminate as of the Stock Option
Determination Date and shall under no circumstances become exercisable. If the
Executive shall cease to be eligible to vest in less than all unvested Stock
Options, then the Stock Options subject to termination under this Section&nbsp;3(b)
shall be determined by terminating first those with the highest per share
exercise price and then terminating Stock Options in descending order of
exercise price. The applicable award agreements for the Stock Options that
remain unvested following the Retirement Date are hereby amended to the extent
necessary to implement this Section&nbsp;3(b); provided, however, that nothing
herein shall amend such award agreements to eliminate or modify the provisions
regarding cancellation and rescission of the Stock Options including without
limitation the non-disclosure, non-solicitation, and assignment of inventions
provisions.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Calculations. The Supplementary Pension Payment and the Black-Scholes
calculations required to be made under Sections&nbsp;3(a) and 3(b) shall be
determined as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination of the
Bonus at the meeting of the Board of Directors scheduled for March 2003 (&#147;March
Meeting&#148;) by Mercer Human Resource Consulting, or such other nationally
recognized actuarial firm as may be designated by the Company (the &#147;Firm&#148;).
For purposes of Section&nbsp;3, the Black-Scholes value shall be determined as soon
as reasonably practicable following the March Meeting based on the average of
the high and low price of a share of Company common stock, remaining option
term, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and stock price volatility (in a
manner consistent with the assumptions provided to the Executive by the Company
on or prior to the Execution Date), each as measured on the date of the March
Meeting, and shall otherwise be determined in a manner consistent with the
methodology used by Mercer Human Resources Consulting for valuing stock options
for employees of the Company during the year 2002 through the Execution Date
(with assumptions updated as of the March Meeting). The Company shall cause
the Firm to furnish such calculations to it and to the Executive and each shall
have five (5)&nbsp;business days after such presentation to discuss the same with
the Firm. Following such five day period, the determination by the Firm shall
be final and binding upon the Company and the Executive, unless the parties
agree otherwise.

Stock Incentive Plans (the &#147;Performance Shares&#148;) shall be settled in cash or in

under the terms of the plans) at such time as performance shares are generally
settled in accordance with their terms as if the Executive had remained
employed by the Company, (iii)&nbsp;the Executive shall be entitled to receive the
vested benefits under the Executive&#146;s account under the Company&#146;s Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with the Executive&#146;s election and the

to participants generally, (iv)&nbsp;the Executive shall be entitled to receive his

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality/Return of Property. The existence of and terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall be held confidential by the Executive,
except for disclosure (i)&nbsp;in connection with an offer of employment by a new
employer, provided that such potential employer shall agree to keep the same

other Affiliated Entities, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
information that is generally known to the public other than as a result of the
breach of this Agreement by the Executive (&#147;Confidential Information&#148;). The
Executive acknowledges that such Confidential Information is specialized,
unique in nature and of great value to the Company and the other Affiliated
Entities, and that such information gives the Company and the other Affiliated
Entities a competitive advantage. Upon termination of the Executive&#146;s

Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Executive is
required to disclose any such confidential or proprietary information pursuant
to applicable law or a subpoena or court order, the Executive shall promptly

the appropriate Affiliated Entity may seek an appropriate protective order or
other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions hereof. The
Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Affiliated Entities to obtain
such a protective order or other remedy. If such order or other remedy is not
obtained prior to the time the Executive is required to make the disclosure, or
the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Executive shall
disclose only that portion of the confidential or proprietary information which
he is advised by counsel that he is legally required to so disclose.
