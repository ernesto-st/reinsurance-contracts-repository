      In this Agreement (including the Recitals, the Schedules and the Appendix
      hereto), except where the context otherwise requires or there is express
      provision to the contrary, words and expressions set out in Appendix X
      shall have the meanings ascribed thereto. Rules of interpretation as
      applicable to this Agreement are also set out in Appendix X.

2     AVAILABILITY

2.1   FACILITY

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance on
      the representations and warranties of the Obligors set out in Clause 6
      (REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES), the Lenders hereby grant and undertake
      to make available to the Borrowers, a loan facility in the maximum
      principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate of eighty-five
      per cent. (85%) of the Aircraft Purchase Price for each of the Eligible
      Aircraft and (ii) US$719,000,000 (seven hundred and nineteen million
      dollars) (the FACILITY AMOUNT).

2.2.1 The Facility shall be available for drawdown at any time during the
      Availability Period on the terms and subject to the conditions of this
      Agreement.

      each of the Eligible Aircraft will be delivered during the Scheduled
      Delivery Month for such Eligible Aircraft specified (if so specified) in

      (c)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the

      of financing or refinancing the acquisition and contributing towards the
      Aircraft Purchase Price of an Eligible Aircraft. None of the National

      Lenders is bound to monitor or verify the application of any amount
      borrowed pursuant to this Agreement and the relevant Loan Supplements.

      available and to perform its obligations in respect of any Utilisation are
      several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to perform its

      (d)   if the proposed aggregate amount of such Advance is less than or
            equal to the aggregate of the Total Commitments at the time;

      (e)   if any requisite approvals of the competent authorities of the
            French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United
            Kingdom shall have been obtained in respect of this Aircraft which
            is the subject of such Utilisation Notice and that COFACE, HERMES
            and ECGD shall have indicated that they are willing to give
            guarantees, insurances or other applicable support (subject to
            satisfaction of the relevant conditions precedent) in terms
            satisfactory to the British National Agent, the French National
            Agent and the German National Agent respectively on the relevant
            Utilisation Date.

      (f)   in respect of any Eligible Aircraft, if the delivery of such
            Eligible Aircraft to the intended Lessee or Sub-Lessee would not
            cause the relevant Export Lessee to breach Clause 7.2 (LEASING AND
            INSURANCE COVENANTS OF EXPORT LESSEES); and

      (g)   if the Eligible Aircraft which the relevant Export Lessee proposes
            to be the subject of the relevant Utilisation will not be registered
            in a Prohibited Country, or the jurisdiction of the principal place
            of business of the intended Lessee will not be a Prohibited Country,
            or the jurisdiction of the principal place of business of the
            intended Lessee will not be the United States of America.

3.1.3 An Export Lessee may issue a Utilisation Notice even if the relevant
      Eligible Aircraft will not be the subject of a Lease on the Utilisation
      Date, provided that the provisions of Clause 7.2.6 shall apply.

3.1.4 The Agent shall:

      (a)   send to each National Agent a copy of each Utilisation Notice
            received from an Export Lessee which complies with Clauses 3.1.1 and
            3.1.2 and shall notify GFC of such compliance; and

      (b)   procure the preparation and circulation to the National Agents and
            the relevant Borrower and GFC of the relevant Utilisation
            Documentation at least five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed
            Utilisation Date except in respect of the first and second
            Utilisations when they may be circulated within such shorter period
            as the Finance Parties may agree.

3.1.5 The relevant Export Lessee shall provide the Agent with written
      confirmation of the Aircraft Purchase Price in each case, as soon as the
      same becomes available from the Seller and in any event not less than five
      (5) Business Days prior to the proposed Utilisation Date.

3.1.6 GFC shall be entitled by notice in writing to the Agent, no later than
      three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed Utilisation Date specified
      in any Utilisation Notice, (a) to postpone such Utilisation Date to
      another date which satisfies the requirements for Utilisation Dates set
      forth in this Agreement or (b) to cancel the Utilisation requested
      pursuant to such Utilisation Notice.

      Agreement and each Advance referred to therein shall be made in accordance
      with and shall be regulated by the terms and conditions of this Agreement,

3.3   ALTERNATIVE OBLIGORS

3.3.1 (a)   Subject to Clause 3.3.1(b), GFC shall be entitled to request that an
            Alternative Borrower and/or an Alternative Export Lessee be
            incorporated into the structure for a Utilisation. No Export Lessee
            shall be entitled to serve a Utilisation Notice in which it is
            proposed that an Alternative Borrower or Alternative Export Lessee
            be incorporated into the structure for a particular Utilisation (in
            whatever capacity) until such Alternative Borrower or Alternative
            Export Lessee has acceded to this Agreement and (save where the last
            sentence of this Clause 3.3.1 applies) has received the consent
            required pursuant to this Clause 3.3.1.

            Any such request shall be made by GFC by written notice to the Agent
            (an ALTERNATIVE OBLIGOR REQUEST). The Alternative Obligor Request
            shall identify the following:

            (i)   whether an Alternative Borrower and/or Alternative Export
                  Lessee is to accede to this Agreement;

            (ii)  the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Alternative Borrower
                  and/or Alternative Export Lessee;

                                     Page 6

<PAGE>


            (iii) in the case of an Alternative Borrower, the identity of the
                  Alternative Borrower Manager, the Alternative Borrower
                  Trustee and the Alternative Borrower Manager Parent (if any);
                  and

            (iv)  in the case of an Alternative Export Lessee, the role which
                  such party is intended to take in the proposed Utilisation.

            The Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) shall
            consider such request in good faith taking into account the
            proposed jurisdiction of incorporation of the proposed Alternative
            Borrower and/or Alternative Export Lessee. Subject to the Agent
            receiving instructions from each of the National Agents, the Agent
            shall inform GFC within 15 Business Days of receipt of an
            Alternative Obligor Request in respect of an Alternative Export
            Lessee and within 30 Business Days in respect of an Alternative
            Borrower as to whether its Alternative Obligor Request has been
            approved by the Majority Lenders any such approval not to be
            unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      (b)   If the proposed Alternative Borrower or Alternative Export Lessee
            has already acceded to this Agreement prior to the date of the
            relevant Alternative Obligor Request for the purposes of a previous
            Utilisation, the approval of the Agent to the incorporation of such
            Alternative Obligor in the structure for the relevant Utilisation
            shall not be required.

3.3.2 Each such Alternative Borrower or Alternative Export Lessee shall be a
      company incorporated in a jurisdiction approved by the Agent (acting on
      the instructions of the Majority Lenders acting reasonably) and shall be
      capable of providing representations and warranties and covenants having
      substantially the same effect as those given by the relevant Obligors in
      Clauses 6 (REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES) and Clause 7 (UNDERTAKINGS AND
      COVENANTS). The Agent and the Lenders shall not unreasonably withhold
      their consent to any such jurisdiction suggested by GFC. Each Alternative
      Export Lessee shall be an affiliate of GFC.

3.3.3 Each Alternative Borrower shall be a company whose shares are held by a
      trustee on trust for charitable purposes or such other person (including,
      without limitation, GFC or any Subsidiary of GFC) as may be approved by
      the National Agents and the German Parallel Lender and shall be
      incorporated in a jurisdiction approved by the Agent (acting on the
      instructions of the National Agents and the German Parallel Lender acting
      reasonably) and shall be capable of providing representations and
      warranties and covenants having substantially the same effect as those
      given by the Cayman Borrower and the Irish Borrower in Clause 6.2
      (REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY EACH BORROWER AND EACH EXPORT LESSEE)
      and Clause 7.3 (BORROWER COVENANT). If an Alternative Borrower is directly
      or indirectly owned by a person other than a Guarantor, such Alternative
      Borrower shall be managed by an established and recognised management
      company on terms substantially similar to the Administration Agreements.

3.3.4 If an Alternative Export Lessee or Alternative Borrower has not already
      acceded to this Agreement for the purposes of a previous Utilisation and
      is to be incorporated into the structure and the consent required pursuant
      to Clause 3.3.1 is given, then as a condition precedent to a Utilisation
      Notice being served in which it is proposed to use such Alternative Export
      Lessee or Alternative Borrower:

      (a)   each such Alternative Export Lessee or Alternative Borrower shall
            accede to this Agreement by executing an Accession Deed and such
            other Transaction Documents as the Agent (acting on the
            instructions of the National Agents and the German Parallel Lender
            acting reasonably) in its reasonable opinion considers appropriate
            so that any such Alternative Export Lessee or Alternative Borrower
            shall become a party to this Agreement and such of the other
            Transaction Documents as may be appropriate as if

                                     Page 7

<PAGE>

            named therein as a party and shall have the same rights, benefits,
            obligations and liabilities thereunder; and

      (b)   each of the parties to this Agreement and any such Alternative
            Borrower and/or Alternative Export Lessee shall enter into such
            other documents and provide such security as the Agent may (acting
            on the instructions of the National Agents and the German Parallel
            Lender acting reasonably) reasonably require in order to ensure that
            the Agent, the Security Trustee and each of the Lenders are in
            substantially the same position (including, without limitation, as
            to their security position) with respect to such:

            (i)   Alternative Borrower, as they are with respect to the Cayman
                  Borrower and the Irish Borrower; and

            (ii)  Alternative Export Lessee, as they are with respect to the
                  Cayman Export Lessee and the Irish Export Lessee.

      Upon receipt by the Agent of the Accession Deed signed on behalf of each
      Obligor and by the proposed Alternative Borrower or Alternative Export
      Lessee, as the case may be, the Agent shall sign the same for itself and
      on behalf of the other Finance Parties and shall as promptly as
      practicable give notice of such execution to all of the parties to the
      Accession Deed. Upon execution of any such Accession Deed, it shall take
      effect in accordance with, but subject to, the terms hereof and thereof.

3.3.5 Each GATX Obligor and each Alternative Borrower hereby irrevocably
      authorises GFC to execute any duly completed Accession Deed on its behalf
      provided that such authorisation does not extend to the execution of an
      Accession Deed on behalf of the Acceding Party (as defined in the
      Accession Deed) named therein. Each of the Finance Parties hereby
      irrevocably authorises the Agent to execute any duly completed Accession
      Deed on its behalf.

3.3.6 If it is proposed that an Alternative Borrower or an Alternative Export
      Lessee accede to this Agreement that is not currently a Borrower or Export
      Lessee (as the case may be) for the purposes of this Agreement, GFC shall
      procure that the Agent (acting on the instructions of the National Agents
      acting reasonably) is provided with the following items, in form and
      substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent no later than fifteen 15
      Business Days prior to the Utilisation in which it is proposed to use such
      acceding Alternative Borrower or Alternative Export Lessee:

      (a)   an Accession Deed duly executed by the parties thereto;

      (b)   in the case of an Alternative Borrower only, a Share Charge duly
            executed by the relevant Alternative Borrower Trustee over the
            entire issued share capital of such acceding Alternative Borrower
            together with certified copies of the minute books and the share
            register (if any) of such acceding Alternative Borrower and the
            originals of the share certificates of such acceding Alternative
            Borrower as referred to therein and duly executed originals of the
            letters of resignation, irrevocable proxy and undated share transfer
            forms referred to therein;

      (c)   in the case of an Alternative Export Lessee only, an Alternative
            Export Lessee Share Charge duly executed by the owner of the entire
            issued share capital of such Alternative Export Lessee over the
            entire issued share capital of such Alternative Export Lessee
            together with certified copies of the minute books and the share
            register (if any) of such Alternative Export Lessee and the
            originals of the share certificates of such Alternative Export
            Lessee as referred to therein and duly executed originals of

                                     Page 8

            the letters of resignation, irrevocable proxy and undated share
            transfer forms referred to therein;

      (g)   a certificate signed by a director of the relevant Alternative
            Export Lessee and/or Alternative Borrower and the relevant
            Alternative Borrower Trustee, in the case of an acceding Alternative
            Borrower, setting out, in each case, the specimen signature of those
            persons authorised to sign the Transaction Documents to which such
            Alternative Obligor is or is to be a party and attaching in each
            case Certified Copies of the following:

      good faith but without obligation any request for an Alternative
      Utilisation. If the Lenders and the Agent consent to an Alternative

3.6   REPAYMENT SCHEDULES

3.6.1 Each Advance:

      (a)   shall be repaid in up to 144 monthly instalments, one on each
            Repayment Date. Each such instalment shall be in an amount set
            opposite such Repayment Date in column 3 of Schedule 2 of the
            relevant Loan Supplement so as to reduce the outstanding balances of
            the Advance to the amount set opposite such Repayment Date in column
            3 of Schedule 2 of the Loan Supplement and shall in any event repay
            the outstanding balance in full on the Final Repayment Date of such
            Advance; and

            made.

3.6.2 The repayment profiles shown in schedule 2 to the Loan Supplement shall be
      calculated on a "mortgage style" basis applying the Relevant Rate for the
      relevant Advance and as follows:

      (a)   if the Utilisation Date is a Reference Date, the schedule will
            provide for repayments of principal, the first of which will be due
            on the first Reference Date after the Utilisation Date with the
            remainder due at monthly intervals thereafter; and

      (b)   if the Utilisation Date is not a Reference Date, the schedule will
            provide for repayments of principal the first of which will be due
            on the second Reference Date after the Utilisation Date; and

      (c)   the final Repayment Date (prior to any application of the proviso in
            the definition of such terms set forth in Appendix X) shall be no
            later than the twelfth (12th) anniversary of the relevant
            Utilisation Date or, in respect of a Refinanced Aircraft or Aircraft
            referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of Delivery Date, the
            twelfth (12th) anniversary of the Delivery Date for such Aircraft
            (FINAL REPAYMENT DATE).

3.7   DISBURSEMENT OF THE LOAN

3.7.1 On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Lenders
      severally agree to make each Advance to the relevant Borrower on the date

      (ii)  to the extent such claim or proof is a necessary procedural step to

3.9.2 Clause 3.9.1 shall be of no application in respect of an Export Lessee and
      such Export Lessee shall be fully liable and the Indemnitees shall be at

      Repayment Date next succeeding such Utilisation Date at a rate per annum
      which is the aggregate of (i) the applicable Margin, (ii) such rate which

      funding its participation in the relevant Advance for the relevant period
      and (iii) the applicable ECA Premium.

4.1.2 The Agent shall calculate the applicable LIBOR or EURIBOR for each
      consecutive Interest Period on the relevant Quotation Date for the

      irrevocable receipt in full by the Security Trustee of all Repayment
      Instalments in respect of a Loan, together with all other amounts due but
      unpaid in respect thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
      the Security Trustee shall confirm in writing to GFC that the Secured Loan
      Obligations in respect of the Loan that has been repaid have been

            such prepayment is to be made (the PREPAYMENT DATE); and

4.4   PREPAYMENT FOLLOWING A TOTAL LOSS

4.4.1 Subject to Clause 4.7 (SUBSTITUTION OF AIRCRAFT), if at any time a Total
      Loss occurs in relation to an Aircraft, the relevant Borrower shall, on or
      prior to the expiry of the period of one hundred and twenty days (120)
      days commencing on the Total Loss Date or, if earlier, the date upon which

      Law Mortgage, the Mortgage, the Borrower Security Assignment and the Lease
      Security Assignment in respect of the Loan that has been prepaid and take
      such other action which GFC may reasonably request of it in order to

4.5   INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK

4.6   NON-PERFORMANCE OF A BORROWER

      of any act or omission of a Borrower which is not caused by any act or
      omission of any Export Lessee or GFC (BORROWER TERMINATION EVENT), the
      Agent, subject to Clause 4.6.2, shall not be entitled to serve an
      Acceleration Notice in respect of the occurrence of such Termination
      Event. The Agent shall serve notice on GFC that a Termination Event as
      contemplated by this Clause 4.6.1 has arisen and the Representatives and
      Lenders shall consult with GFC for a period not exceeding fourteen (14)
      Business Days from the date of such notice with a view to restructuring
      each Loan under which the relevant Borrower is the borrower and GFC shall
      pay for the Expenses incurred by the Representatives and the Lenders for
      such negotiations as well as (if alternative arrangements are agreed) to
      complete all steps required to implement such restructuring and all
      rectifications and amendments to the relevant Transaction Documents in
      relation to each Loan under which such Borrower is the borrower.

4.6.2 Notwithstanding Clause 4.6.1, in the event of a Termination Event
      occurring and continuing as described in Clause 4.6.1, the Agent shall be
      entitled, subject to any other arrangements satisfactory to the Agent
      having been agreed, to serve an Acceleration Notice immediately if the
      Agent, acting in good faith, believes that not to do so would materially
      prejudice the interests of the Finance Parties and/or any of the Export
      Credit Agencies.

4.6.3 If a resolution acceptable to GFC and the Majority Lenders is obtained as
      a result of procedure referred to in Clause 4.6.1, GFC and the Lenders
      shall implement the restructuring of each relevant Loan and rectifications
      and amendments to the relevant Transaction Documents (including the
      transfer of the obligations of the relevant Borrower to another Borrower)
      and the replication of the relevant Aircraft Security Documents duly
      executed by the relevant Obligor being provided to the Agent in respect of
      the relevant Secured Loan Obligations on terms satisfactory to the Agent
      (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) within 20 days from
      the date when such resolution is reached at the cost of GFC.

4.6.4 If no resolution acceptable to GFC and the Majority Lenders is found
      within the 14 day period referred to in Clause 4.6.1 or if the relevant
      Export Lessee fails to implement such restructuring of each relevant Loan
      and rectification and amendment to the relevant Transaction Documents
      within the 20 day period referred to in Clause 4.6.3, provided the
      relevant Borrower Termination Event is continuing, the relevant Borrower
      shall prepay to the Agent the Termination Amount in respect of every Loan
      for which the relevant Borrower is the borrower.

4.6.5 Provided that no Termination Event (other than a Borrower Termination
      Event) has occurred and is continuing and immediately upon irrevocable
      receipt of the Proceeds referred to in Clause 4.6.4 into the relevant
      Proceeds Account for application in accordance with Clause 12.6
      (APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF A PREPAYMENT MADE
      PURSUANT TO CLAUSES 4.3, 4.6, 4.8 AND 4.10) the Security Trustee shall
      confirm in writing to GFC that the Secured Loan Obligations in respect of
      the Loans that have been prepaid have been satisfied in full at which time
      title to the relevant Aircraft shall be transferred by the relevant
      Borrower in accordance with the terms of the relevant Credit Sale
      Agreement, whereupon the Security

                                    Page 17
<PAGE>

      Trustee, at the request and cost of GFC, shall release the English Law
      Mortgage, the Mortgage, the Borrower Security Assignment and the Lease
      Security Assignment in respect of the Loan that has been prepaid and take
      such other action which GFC may reasonably request of it in order to
      effect such releases.

4.7   SUBSTITUTION OF AIRCRAFT

4.7.1 Subject to no Termination Event having occurred and continuing, if a Total
      Loss occurs in respect of an Aircraft (the EXISTING AIRCRAFT), the
      relevant Export Lessee may, by notice to the Agent, request permission to
      substitute for the Existing Aircraft another Airbus aircraft of the same
      type or in the same family of aircraft as the Existing Aircraft (the
      REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT). The notice shall provide details of the age from
      delivery by the Manufacturer and number of block hours since the last
      heavy maintenance check of the proposed Replacement Aircraft. The National
      Agents and the German Parallel Lenders shall consider any such request in
      good faith, in accordance with the then current practice of the Export
      Credit Agencies in relation to the substitution of aircraft, and shall
      inform the relevant Export Lessee (as the case may be) within 21 Business
      Days of the receipt of such notice as to whether the proposed substitution
      has been approved and, if approved, the terms upon which such Replacement
      Aircraft shall be substituted for the Existing Aircraft. The parties to
      this Agreement acknowledge that the current practice of the Export Credit
      Agencies is that Export Credit Agency-supported Airbus aircraft may only
      be substituted in Export Credit Agency-supported facilities by new Airbus
      aircraft of the same type or in the same family of aircraft as the
      Existing Aircraft.

4.7.2 Following a request by the relevant Export Lessee for the substitution of
      an Aircraft in accordance with Clause 4.7.1 and if the Total Loss Proceeds
      have been paid to the Security Trustee in accordance with the provisions
      of Clause 4.4 (PREPAYMENT FOLLOWING A TOTAL LOSS) either:

      (a)   prior to the Agent informing the relevant Export Lessee of the
            National Agents' and German Parallel Lender's decision as to such
            substitution; or

      (b)   if the National Agents and the German Parallel Lender have approved
            the substitution of such Existing Aircraft, prior to the actual
            substitution of such Existing Aircraft by a Replacement Aircraft,

      then the Total Loss Proceeds shall remain in the relevant Proceeds Account
      pending completion of the substitution (and assuming, in the case of
      Clause 4.7.2(a), that the substitution will be approved by the Lenders)
      for up to one hundred and eighty (180) days or such other period of time
      as shall then reflect the then current practice of the Export Credit
      Agencies as notified to the relevant National Agent and the German
      Parallel Lender by its Export Credit Agencies. If the Existing Aircraft is
      then substituted by the Replacement Aircraft in accordance with the
      approval and terms given or specified pursuant to Clause 4.7.1, the Total
      Loss Proceeds (together with accrued interest thereon at the rate agreed
      between the Agent and the relevant Export Lessee) in respect of such
      Existing Aircraft shall be returned to the relevant Export Lessee,
      provided that no Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, and
      otherwise the Total Loss Proceeds shall be applied in accordance with
      Clause 12.4 (APPLICATION OF TOTAL LOSS PROCEEDS).

4.8   PREPAYMENT IF NOT LEASED

4.8,1 If an Aircraft is not (a) delivered to a Lessee pursuant to a Lease within
      one hundred and eighty (180) days after the relevant Delivery Date or such
      longer period as the National Agents may agree in writing, the relevant
      Export Lessee shall, on the first Banking Day following the expiry of such
      one hundred and eighty (180) day period or any such longer period as may
      be

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>

      agreed, pay into the Proceeds Account the Termination Amount in respect of
      the relevant Loan relating to such Aircraft as such amount shall be
      notified to it in writing by the Agent and immediately upon irrevocable
      receipt of such funds payable under this Clause 4.8 in the Proceeds
      Account for application in accordance with Clause 12.6 (APPLICATION OF
      PROCEEDS RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF A PREPAYMENT MADE PURSUANT TO CLAUSES
      4.3, 4.6, 4.8 AND 4.10), the Security Trustee shall confirm in writing to
      GFC that the Secured Loan Obligations in respect of the Loans that have
      been prepaid have been satisfied in full at which time title to the
      relevant Aircraft shall be transferred by the relevant Borrower in
      accordance with the terms of the relevant Credit Sale Agreement, whereupon
      the Security Trustee, at the request and cost of GFC, shall release the
      English Law Mortgage, the Mortgage, the Borrower Security Assignment and
      the Lease Security Assignment in respect of the Loan that has been prepaid
      and take such other action which GFC may reasonably request of it in order
      to effect such releases.

4.10  MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT

4.10.1 A mandatory prepayment event in respect of a particular Loan shall occur:

      (a)   if a Home Country Notice or a US Restriction Notice or both are
            served on the relevant Borrower or Export Lessee (as the case may
            be) in accordance with the provisions of Clause 7.2.4; or

      (b)   with respect to a particular Aircraft, any conditions precedent
            which the Agent has agreed in writing may be satisfied after an
            Advance has been made have not been so satisfied within the period
            stipulated in such notice from the Agent; or

      (c)   if any of the Aircraft Security Documents (other than an English Law
            Mortgage which is not the relevant Mortgage for such Aircraft where
            the relevant State of Registration is the United Kingdom), at any
            time and for any reason, ceases to be valid or enforceable in
            accordance with its terms and such circumstance, if capable of
            remedy, is not remedied within fourteen (14) days; or

      (d)   in such other circumstances as GFC and the Agent may agree in
            writing from time to time .

      If a mandatory prepayment event pursuant to Clause 4.10.1 (a), (b), (c) or
      (d) shall occur and be continuing, the Agent may demand repayment of the
      relevant Loan whereupon the relevant Termination Amount shall become due
      and payable on the next succeeding Repayment Date following such demand
      or, if such Repayment Date falls within seven (7) Business Days of such
      demand, the second succeeding Repayment Date provided that, if in the
      reasonable opinion of the Agent, such delay might be prejudicial to the
      interests of the Lenders, it may demand immediate repayment and
      immediately upon irrevocable receipt of such funds payable under this
      Clause 4.10.1 in the relevant Proceeds Account, the Security Trustee shall
      (provided that no Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) at the
      cost of GFC confirm in writing to GFC that the Secured Loan Obligations in
      respect of the Loans that have been prepaid have been satisfied in full
      after which title to the relevant Aircraft shall be transferred by the
      relevant Borrower free and clear of Borrower's Liens or Finance Party
      Liens to such person as is nominated by GFC (who shall not be a Borrower
      or an Export Lessee).

       Unpaid Amount from (and including) the due date to (but excluding) the
       date of actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at the Default

       and be due and payable on the last day of each Default Interest Period
       and, if not paid, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be
       compounded on such date PROVIDED always that interest shall not be
       compounded on any such sum until such sum has been unpaid for more than
       one week.

4.11.3 The payment of interest by an Obligor pursuant to Clause 4.11.1 shall in
       no way preclude any Finance Party from making any other claim or pursuing
       any other right or remedy that may be available to it or otherwise
       prejudice any such claim, right or remedy.

4.12   DEDUCTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS

4.12.1 All sums payable to the Finance Parties pursuant to or in connection with
       any Transaction Document shall be paid in full without any set-off or
       counterclaim whatsoever and free and clear of all deductions or

4.12.2 Each Lender shall deliver to the Agent three completed and signed United
       States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8EXP or such
       other form as may be prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the

       certifying that such Lender is entitled to a complete exemption from
       United States withholding taxes on all payments pursuant to this
       Agreement or in connection with any Transaction Document:

       (a)   in the case of each initial Lender, on or prior to the date of its
             execution and delivery of this Agreement; and

       (b)   in the case of each Transferee, on or prior to the date of
             execution of the Transfer Certificate pursuant to which it becomes
             a Lender;

       (c)   in the case of an initial Lender and each Transferee (other than as
             aforesaid), thereafter:

            (i)   on or prior to (or as soon as practicable after) the date on
                  which the Internal Revenue Service form previously delivered
                  by such Lender or Transferee ceases to be effective or becomes
                  inaccurate; or

            (ii)  promptly after receipt of a request therefor from any GATX
                  Obligor;

            and   as long as any portion of any Advance remains outstanding.

       PROVIDED THAT this Clause 4.12.2 shall not apply to:

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>


      (i)   a Lender that is not legally entitled to an exemption from United
            States withholding taxes as a result of a Change in Tax Law, in the
            case of an initial Lender, after the date of execution of this
            Agreement and, in the case of any Transferee, after the date on
            which such Transferee became a Lender. CHANGE IN TAX LAW, as used in
            the preceding sentence, means any of the following: (i) the
            enactment of any amendment to the United States Internal Revenue
            Code, (ii) the publication of any new regulation to the United
            States Internal Revenue Code or any amendment of any such
            regulation, or (iii) the entry into force of any new income tax
            convention to which the United States is a party or any amendment of
            or supplement to any income tax convention to which the United
            States is a party or the revocation of any such income tax
            convention; or

      (ii)  any Lender that (i) is incorporated or otherwise organised under
            the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof and is
            a corporation (or an entity taxable as a corporation) for United
            States federal income tax purposes or (ii) is an Export Credit
            Agency.

      The Agent shall deliver to the Cayman Borrower and the Irish Borrower
      (with a copy to GFC) a completed and signed United States Internal Revenue
      Service Form W-8IMY (including as attachments copies of the current
      Internal Revenue Service forms that the Agent received from the Lenders):

      (a)   on or before the date of execution of this Agreement;

      (b)   before or promptly after the date of any transfer by a Lender to a
            Transferee pursuant to Clause 18.2 (Transfers by Lenders) (but in
            any event not later than fifteen (15) Business Days before the first
            date on which a payment is due to the Lenders with respect to the
            Loan that is the subject of the Transfer Certificate); and

      (c)   thereafter:

            (i)   on or prior to (or as soon as practicable after) the date on
                  which the Internal Revenue Service Form previously delivered
                  by the Agent ceases to be effective or becomes inaccurate; or

            (ii)  promptly after receipt of a request therefor from any GATX
                  Obligor.

      If the principal officer responsible for United States tax matters of any
      Lender or the Agent knows that the information set forth in any Internal
      Revenue Service form delivered by such Lender or the Agent pursuant to
      this Clause 4.12.2 is no longer correct and that the exemption claimed
      therein is no longer available to the Lender or the Agent as a result
      thereof, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) shall notify GFC of
      such circumstance.

4.12.3 If any deduction or withholding is required of any Borrower or any
       Export Lessee in respect of any payment due to the Agent, the Security
       Trustee, any Borrower or any Lender by any Borrower or any Export Lessee
       pursuant to or in connection with any Transaction Document, the relevant
       Borrower or any Export Lessee, shall:

      (a)   ensure that the deduction or withholding is made and that it does
            not exceed the minimum legal requirement therefor;

      (b)   pay or procure the payment of the full amount deducted or withheld
            to the relevant Taxation or other authority in accordance with the
            Applicable Law;

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>

      (c)   (if the payment is to be made by any Borrower, or GFC or any other
            Obligor), increase the payment in respect of which the deduction or
            withholding is required so that the net amount received by the
            relevant Lender, Borrower or Representative (as the case may be)
            after the deduction or withholding has been made (and after taking
            account of any further deduction or withholding which is required to
            be made as a consequence of the increase) shall equal the amount
            which that Lender, Borrower or Representative or Export Credit
            Agency would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any
            requirement to make a deduction or withholding;

      (d)   (if the payment is to be made by any person other than a Borrower or
            GFC or any other Obligor), the relevant Borrower shall pay directly
            to the Agent for the account of the relevant Representative or the
            relevant Lender such sum (in Clause 4.12.3(d) a COMPENSATING SUM) as
            will, after taking into account any deduction or withholding which
            the payer is obliged to make from the compensating sum, enable the
            relevant Representative or Lender (as the case may be) to receive,
            on the due date for payment, a net sum equal to the sum which it
            would have received in the absence of any requirement to make a
            deduction or withholding; and

      (e)   promptly deliver to the Agent or procure the delivery of appropriate
            receipts or other documents evidencing the deduction or withholding
            which has been made.

4.12.4 If a Representative is obliged by any Change in Law or Change in Tax Law
       to make any deduction or withholding from any payment to a Lender or
       another Representative (an AGENCY PAYMENT) which relates to an amount
       received by that Representative for the account of that Lender pursuant
       to this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents the relevant
       Borrower shall pay directly to the Lender such sum (in this Clause 4.12.4
       a COMPENSATING SUM) as will, after taking into account any deduction or
       withholding which the relevant Borrower is obliged to make from the
       compensating sum, enable the Lender to receive, on the due date for
       payment of the agency payment, an amount equal to the agency payment
       which the Lender would have received in the absence of any requirement to
       make a deduction or withholding.

4.12.5 If a Representative is obliged other than by any Change in Law or Change
       in Tax Law to make any deduction or withholding from any payment to a
       Lender or another Representative which relates to an amount received by
       that Representative for the account of that Lender, GFC, the relevant
       Representatives and the relevant Lenders shall consult together with a
       view to trying to mitigate against such deduction or withholding
       including redirecting any payment flows to avoid monies passing through
       such Representative and, if reasonably required by any Representative,
       payments shall be made directly to the relevant National Agent or Lender,
       as the case may be.

4.12.6 If a Lender or Representative determines, in its reasonable discretion,
       that it has received, realised, utilised and retained a Tax benefit by
       reason of any deduction or withholding in respect of which any Obligor
       has made an increased payment or paid a compensating sum under this
       Clause 4.12, such Lender or Representative shall, so long as no
       Termination Event has occurred and is continuing and provided it has
       received all amounts which are then due and payable by the relevant
       Borrower and each of the other Obligors under the Transaction Documents
       or, if the Tax benefit exceeds the amounts then due and payable, has
       set-off such amounts against the Tax benefit, pay to the relevant Obligor
       (to the extent that the Lender or Representative can do so without
       prejudicing the amount of such benefit or the right of such Lender or
       Representative to obtain any other benefit, relief or allowance which may
       be available to it) such amount as shall leave such Lender or
       Representative in no better or worse after Tax position than such Lender
       or Representative would have been in if the deduction or withholding had
       not been required PROVIDED that:

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>

      (a)   each Lender and Representative shall use its reasonable discretion
            as to the time at which and the order and manner in which it
            realises or utilises any Tax benefit and shall not be obliged to
            arrange its business or its Tax affairs in any particular way in
            order to be eligible for any Tax benefit;

      (b)   no Lender or Representative shall be obliged to disclose any
            information regarding its business, Tax affairs or Tax computations;

      (c)   if any Lender or Representative has made a payment to the relevant
            Obligor pursuant to this Clause 4.12.6 on account of any Tax benefit
            and it subsequently transpires that such Lender or Representative
            did not receive that Tax benefit, or received a lesser Tax benefit
            the relevant Obligor shall pay on demand to such Lender or
            Representative such sum as such Lender or Representative may
            determine as being necessary to restore the after-Tax position of
            the Lender or Representative to that which it would have been had no
            adjustment under this proviso (c) been necessary; and

      (d)   the Lender or Representative shall not be obliged to make any
            payment under this Clause 4.12.6 if either it is an Export Credit
            Agency or if, by doing so, it would contravene the terms of any
            Applicable Law or any notice, direction or requirement of any
            governmental or regulatory authority (whether or not having the
            force of law).

4.12.7 If any amount falls due to be paid to the Agent or any Lender pursuant to
       or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
       Documents on a day which is not a Banking Day, then it shall be due and
       payable on the next succeeding Banking Day and the amount,(if necessary),
       shall be adjusted accordingly.

4.12.8 Each Lender (other than an Export Credit Agency), on the date on which it
       becomes a party to this Agreement, represents to the Agent and each
       Obligor that it is:

       (a)  either:

            (i)   not resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax
                  purposes; or

            (ii)  a "bank" as defined in section 840A of the Income and
                  Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (or any statutory re-enactment or
                  modification thereof, in substantially the same form and
                  content as of the date hereof) and resident in the United
                  Kingdom; and

       (b)  beneficially entitled to the principal and interest payable by the
            Agent to it under this Agreement,

       and shall forthwith notify the Agent and GFC if either representation
       ceases to be correct.

       Rate) payable in respect of any Loan pursuant to this Agreement and any
       relevant Loan Supplement shall be paid in the same currency as the

4.13.2 Subject to Clause 4.13.1, all other amounts payable to the Agent,
       the Security Trustee and/or the Lenders pursuant to or in connection with

       otherwise provided in the relevant notice or demand for payment, be paid

       relevant Lender or the Security Trustee).

      (p)   it shall inform the Representatives promptly after it becomes aware
            of any:

                                     Page 30
<PAGE>

            (i)   Lien which has arisen over or in respect of any of the
                  Aircraft or any Part thereof other than any Permitted Lien; or

            (ii)  any steps being taken by the holders of any Lien (including
                  any Permitted Lien) to exercise or enforce that Lien or any
                  rights in respect thereof;

      (q)   it shall not voluntarily wind itself up;

      (r)   it shall not knowingly do anything or take any action or omit to
            take any action which has or may have the effect of prejudicing the
            entitlement of any Representative or any of the Lenders against a
            liquidator, receiver, administrator or similar officer or official,
            to all rights, monies and property owed to any Representative or any
            of the Lenders by the relevant Obligor (as the case may be) pursuant
            to the Transaction Documents to which it is a party;

      (s)   save as contemplated pursuant to the Transaction Documents, the
            Intra-Group Financing Arrangements or any arrangements to be
            implemented pursuant to Clause 7.9, it shall not sell, lease,
            transfer or otherwise dispose of, by one or more transactions or
            series of transactions (whether related or not), the whole or any
            part of its revenues or assets; and

      (t)   save as contemplated pursuant to the Transaction Documents, the
            Intra-Group Financing Arrangements or any arrangements to be
            implemented pursuant to Clause 7.9, it shall not sell or otherwise
            dispose of its interest in any Aircraft until the Loan in respect of
            such Aircraft has been paid in full and the Security Trustee
            confirms in writing to GFC that the Secured Loan Obligations in
            respect of such Loan have been satisfied in full;

      (u)   in the case of the Cayman Borrower and each other Borrower
            incorporated in the Cayman Islands, it will not take any action, nor
            permit any action to be taken, which would result in it ceasing to
            be an exempted limited company in the Cayman Islands;

      (v)   it shall not without the prior written consent of the Agent create
            or permit to subsist any Lien over all or any of its present and
            future revenues and assets other than a Permitted Lien;

      (w)   it shall review every three (3) months any currency exposure it may
            have in respect of Insurances taken out in a currency different from
            the currency of the Loan relating to the Aircraft to which such
            Insurances relate.

7.2   LEASING AND INSURANCE COVENANTS OF EXPORT LESSEES

7.2.1 Until all of the Secured Loan Obligations have been paid in full, each
      Export Lessee hereby undertakes and covenants with each of the Finance
      Parties separately and severally from the date of this Agreement or, if it
      is not a party to this Agreement on the date of this Agreement, from the
      date upon which such Export Lessee accedes to this Agreement that, save as
      may be agreed from time to time with the Agent, it shall ensure that each
      Lease of an Aircraft which is being leased by it complies with the Minimum
      Lease Provisions. In addition, each Export Lessee in respect of itself and
      in respect of Aircraft leased to it pursuant to a Credit Sale Agreement
      shall:

      (a)   ensure that each Lease is in English;

      (b)   with the exception of the Credit Sale Agreement or any Intermediate
            Lease, ensure that no Aircraft is subject to any instalment sale
            agreement, conditional sale agreement

                                     Page 31
<PAGE>

            or other lease-purchase agreement conferring upon the bailee any
            ownership right, title or interest to or in the relevant Aircraft,
            including, without limitation, by means of a purchase option at a
            nominal price, without obtaining the prior written approval of the
            Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders) provided
            always that Export Lessees may grant a purchase option over any
            Aircraft to any Lessee if the exercise of such option is expressly
            conditional on the Aircraft Security Documents for such Aircraft
            having been discharged;

      (c)   ensure that each Aircraft shall, unless in or imminently scheduled
            for major maintenance or modification or as otherwise agreed by the
            Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders), be
            registered in the jurisdiction of incorporation (other than the
            Cayman Islands) or such of:

            (i)   the Borrower which is the owner of such Aircraft (including in
                  the name of an owner trustee on behalf of the Borrower in the
                  United States of America); or

            (ii)  if such Aircraft is an Off-Lease Aircraft, the Export Lessee
                  which is leasing such Aircraft pursuant to a Credit Sale
                  Agreement; or

            (iii) a Lessee; or

            (iv)  any Sub-Lessee, or

            (v)   such other jurisdiction as the Agent may consent to in writing

            in each case with the interests of the relevant Borrower as owner
            noted on the register of the relevant Aviation Authority to the
            extent permitted by Applicable Law;

      (d)   ensure that throughout the period of the relevant Loan, legal title
            to the Aircraft financed under such Loan shall vest in a Borrower.
            The relevant Export Lessee shall (at its own cost) take all steps,
            or procure that all steps are taken, which are required by law in
            the State of Registration and the jurisdiction in which the Lessee
            or any Sub- Lessee has its principal place of business to protect
            and perfect the relevant Borrower's ownership interest in the
            Aircraft;

      (e)   in the event that any proposed leasing structure requires an
            Intermediate Lease, ensure that such Intermediate Lease shall be
            made between two Export Lessees, ensure that such Intermediate Lease
            is expressly subject and subordinate to the Credit Sale Agreement
            and the Mortgage and ensure that the relevant Export Lessee who is
            the lessor under such Intermediate Lease executes in favour of the
            Security Trustee an Intermediate Lease Security Assignment with
            respect to such Intermediate Lease;

      (f)   it shall comply or procure compliance with all of the
            Insurance Undertakings in respect of such Aircraft, Provided
            Always that such Export Lessee shall not be in breach of this
            Clause 7.2.(f) in relation to the Insurances effected with
            respect to any Aircraft if:

            (i)   such Insurances are not in compliance with the requirements of
                  the Insurance Undertaking (any such Insurance Undertaking in
                  respect of which an Export Lessee is not in compliance from
                  time to time being referred to herein as a NON-COMPLIANT
                  MATTER); and

            (ii)  such Export Lessee has notified the Agent of the details of
                  such Non-Compliant Matter; and

            (iii) either:

                                     Page 32
<PAGE>

                  (aa)  the Agent (acting solely on the instructions of the
                        National Agents) has granted a waiver in respect of such
                        Non-Compliant Matter; or

                  (bb)  the Agent has not given notice to such Export Lessee
                        requiring such Non-Compliant Matter to be complied with;

      (g)   manage or procure that GFC shall manage each Aircraft and the Lease
            pursuant to which it is leased at any time, monitor the Lessee's
            performance of its obligations in the Lease and take such action
            after an event of default thereunder in each case in accordance with
            the Standard;

      (h)   notify the Agent in writing promptly upon the installation on any
            Aircraft of any leased equipment to which the relevant Borrower
            shall not take title and which has a value greater than one million
            dollars (US$1,000,000);

      (i)   promptly after the Delivery Date for each Aircraft provide the Agent
            with a list of any lessee furnished equipment on such Aircraft and
            procure that, as at the redelivery date under such Lease, such
            equipment is either removed from such Aircraft or title thereto is
            transferred to the relevant Borrower;

7.2.2 Save as the Export Credit Agencies may agree from time to time, an Export
      Lessee shall not permit an Aircraft to be delivered to a Lessee (if it is
      a technical operator of aircraft) or a Sub-Lessee (if the Lessee is not a
      technical operator of aircraft and the Sub-Lessee is a technical operator
      of aircraft) (OPERATOR LESSEE) directly under a Lease or indirectly under
      a Sub-Lease if such delivery is to a Operator Lessee which is the first
      Operator Lessee of such Aircraft and unless each of the National Agents
      agree otherwise in writing (i) as a result of delivery of that Aircraft to
      that Operator Lessee more than twenty five per cent, of the Aircraft
      either financed under this Agreement and approved by the Export Credit
      Agencies for such financing (rounded down to the nearest whole number and
      determined by number and not by value) would be Home Country Aircraft or
      (ii) such Operator Lessee is incorporated or has its principal place of
      business in the United States of America.

7.2.3 The restrictions set out in Clause 7.2.2 shall not:

      (a)   prevent the delivery of an Aircraft to an Operator Lessee which is
            not the first Operator Lessee of that Aircraft since its Delivery
            Date provided that the Lease or Sub-Lease to such Operator Lessee
            commences on or after the second anniversary of the Delivery Date of
            such Aircraft; or

      (b)   prevent the delivery of an Aircraft to an Operator Lessee in breach
            of any such restrictions following the bona fide repossession of
            such Aircraft by, or the delivery or redelivery of such Aircraft to,
            the relevant Borrower or relevant Export Lessee as a result of the
            termination of the leasing of such Aircraft under a previous Lease
            prior to its scheduled expiry date as a result of a default
            termination of the relevant Lease.

      (c)   require the prepayment of a Loan in respect of a Home Country
            Aircraft if any such limit is breached as a result of (i) the
            prepayment of a Loan in respect of another Aircraft (by reason of
            the Total Loss of such Aircraft) or (ii) the termination or expiry
            of the leasing of another Aircraft which is not a Home Country
            Aircraft.

      For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Refinanced Aircraft, the
      first Operator Lessee of such Refinanced Aircraft shall continue to be the
      relevant Lessee as at the Delivery Date notwithstanding the novation and
      amendment of the relevant Lease.

7.2.4

                                     Page 33
<PAGE>

      (a)   If, at any time, more than twenty-five per cent, of all the Aircraft
            financed under this Agreement and approved by the Export Credit
            Agencies for such financing (rounded down to the nearest whole
            numbers and determined by number and not by value) are Home Country
            Aircraft, the Agent may at the direction of the National Agents and
            the German Parallel Lender serve a notice (the HOME COUNTRY NOTICE)
            on the relevant Export Lessee requiring the prepayment of Loans
            relating to Home Country Aircraft so that the provisions of Clause
            7.2.2 are then complied with. The Agent shall consult with the
            relevant Export Lessee as to the identity of the specific Loans
            which shall be prepaid and the relevant Export Lessee shall procure
            that the relevant Borrower prepays the amounts specified in Clause
            4.10.1 (MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT) in accordance with Clause 4.10.3
            on the date falling 5 Business Days after the Agent has notified the
            relevant Borrower of the amounts to be prepaid in accordance with
            Clause 4.10.1 (MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT).

      (b)   If the restriction set out in Clause 7.2.2(ii) is breached in
            respect of any Aircraft, the Agent may at the direction of the
            Export Credit Agencies serve a notice (the US RESTRICTION NOTICE) on
            the relevant Export Lessee requiring the prepayment of the Loan in
            respect of the relevant Aircraft. The relevant Export Lessee shall
            procure that the relevant Borrower shall prepay the amounts
            specified in Clause 4.10.1 (MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT) in
            accordance with 4.10.3 (MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT) on the date
            falling five (5) Business Days after the Agent has notified the
            relevant Borrower of the amounts to be prepaid in accordance with
            Clause 4.10.1 (MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT).

7.2.5 Inspection

      (a)   Prior to the occurrence of a Relevant Event, the relevant Export
            Lessee shall, upon the request (in this Clause 7.2.5, a REQUEST) of
            the Agent, which shall not be given more frequently than once a
            year, provide the Agent promptly with copies of the inspection
            reports (if any) which have been prepared for the relevant Export
            Lessee pursuant to the provisions of the relevant Lease in respect
            of the Aircraft specified in the Request. If no inspection report
            has been prepared at such time for a particular Aircraft but an
            inspection report has been prepared for an Export Lessee in relation
            to an aircraft leased to the same lessee as the Lessee of such
            Aircraft by an Obligor, the relevant Export Lessee shall procure
            that a copy of such inspection report is promptly provided to the
            Agent. If the inspection report shows, or any other information
            which has come to the attention of the Agent shows, that repairs to
            the Aircraft are required in order for the terms of this Agreement
            to be complied with, the Agent shall be entitled to request that an
            inspection report be prepared for the Aircraft specified in the
            Request. The relevant Export Lessee shall provide evidence to the
            Agent verifying that any repairs recommended by the inspection
            reports have been completed provided that, if the Aircraft is leased
            to a Lessee at such time, the relevant Export Lessee shall procure
            that the relevant Lessee provides such evidence in accordance with
            the terms of the relevant Lease and the relevant Export Lessee shall
            only be under an obligation to provide such evidence to the Agent
            upon receipt by the relevant Export Lessee of such evidence from the
            relevant Lessee.

      (b)   The relevant Export Lessee shall ensure that it shall be entitled
            under the terms of the relevant Lease, on receiving notice from the
            Agent after the occurrence of a Relevant Event (other than a
            Relevant Event occurring solely due to the acts or omissions of a
            Borrower provided that such acts or omissions shall not have been
            caused by an act or omission of another Obligor) and so long as the
            same is continuing, to require that the relevant Lessee or
            Sub-Lessee gives permission to the Agent or its duly authorised
            agent, to inspect the relevant Aircraft, Technical Records or Engine
            at such time as the Agent may specify in its notice or such other
            time as may be mutually agreed between

                                    Page 34
<PAGE>

            the relevant Export Lessee and the Agent. The Agent shall have no
            duty to make any such inspection and shall not incur any liability
            or obligation by reason of not making any such inspection.

      (c)   The relevant Export Lessee shall procure that for the purposes
            referred to in Clause 7.2.5(a) and (b) and subject to the
            limitations therein contained, the Agent and its duly authorised
            surveyors shall be permitted such access to the Aircraft as the
            Agent shall reasonably require in order to satisfy the Agent that
            the relevant Export Lessee is complying with its obligations under
            this Agreement PROVIDED THAT the light of the Agent to inspect the
            Aircraft or to have the Aircraft surveyed shall not be exercised so
            as to unreasonably disrupt the normal commercial operation of the
            Aircraft. The relevant Export Lessee shall procure that the Lessee
            shall as soon as is practicably consistent with the requirements of
            the maintenance programme described in the relevant Lease and
            approved by the Aviation Authority, effect such repairs to the
            relevant Aircraft as shall be shown by the inspection to be required
            in order for the terms of this Agreement to be complied with. The
            relevant Export Lessee shall provide evidence to the Agent verifying
            that any repairs recommended by the inspection reports have been
            completed provided that if the Aircraft is leased to a Lessee at
            such time, the relevant Export Lessee shall use all reasonable
            endeavours to ensure that the relevant Lessee provides such evidence
            in accordance with the terms of the relevant Lease and Export Lessee
            shall only be under an obligation to provide such evidence to the
            Agent upon receipt by the relevant Export Lessee of such evidence
            from the relevant Lessee.

      (d)   The cost of any such inspections referred to in this Clause 7.2.5
            shall be borne by the relevant Export Lessee and the relevant Export
            Lessee shall reimburse the Agent for all reasonable costs and
            expenses incurred by the Agent or its nominees in conducting any
            such inspection (including further inspection reports confirming
            that the defects or deficiencies have been corrected) including,
            without limitation, any reasonable fees payable to technical experts
            and/or out of pocket Expenses.

7.2.6 If an Aircraft is an Off-Lease Aircraft, then:

      (a)   unless the Security Trustee (acting on the instructions of the
            Majority Lender's) otherwise agrees, the relevant Aircraft shall be
            registered in the name of the relevant Borrower or the relevant
            Export Lessee (as the case may be) in the United States, the United
            Kingdom, Ireland or such other jurisdiction as the Agent (acting on
            the instructions of the National Agents and the German Parallel
            Lender) may consent to in writing, and to the extent permitted by
            Applicable Law, the relevant Mortgage shall be registered in the
            aircraft mortgage register with the Aviation Authority;

      (b)   the relevant Export Lessee shall at all times carry out the
            Operations Undertaking and the Replacement of Parts, Alterations,
            Modifications and Additions Undertakings.

7.3   BORROWER COVENANTS

      Until all of the Secured Loan Obligations have been satisfied in full,
      each Borrower hereby undertakes and covenants with each Finance Party
      (severally as to itself only) that from the date of this Agreement:

      (a)   it shall remain duly incorporated and validly existing under the
            laws of the Cayman Islands (in the case of the Cayman Borrower),
            Ireland (in the case of the Irish Borrower) or the laws of the
            jurisdiction stated in paragraph 2.1(d) of the relevant Accession
            Deed (in the case of each Alternative Borrower and Alternative
            Export Lessee);

                                     Page 35
<PAGE>

      (b)   it will limit its business exclusively to the purchase, financing,
            leasing and disposal of the Aircraft and the transactions
            contemplated by the Transaction Documents and matters reasonably
            incidental thereto;

      (c)   will not, without the prior written consent of the Agent, enter
            into, any contract or agreement with any person, and will not,
            without the prior written approval of the Agent otherwise create or
            incur, any liability to any person, in each case other than as
            provided for, or contemplated by, the Transaction Documents executed
            or to be executed by it or other than such liabilities with respect
            to Taxes, ordinary costs and overhead expenses as have arisen or may
            arise in the ordinary course of its business as referred to in the
            immediately preceding paragraph;

      (d)   to the extent possible pursuant to applicable law, it will obtain or
            cause to be obtained, maintain in full force and effect and comply
            in all material respects with the conditions and restrictions (if
            any) imposed in, or in connection with, every consent,
            authorisation, licence or approval of governmental or public bodies
            or authorities or courts and do, or cause to be done, all other acts
            and things, which may from time to time be necessary or desirable
            under applicable law for the continued due performance of all its
            obligations under the Transaction Documents;

      (e)   subject to indemnification in respect of such Taxes (other than
            those in respect of which it is personally liable) pursuant to the
            terms of this Agreement, it will promptly discharge or procure the
            discharge of all or any Taxes which are payable by it from time to
            time;

      (f)   in the case of the Cayman Borrower and each other Borrower
            incorporated in the Cayman Islands, it will not take any action, nor
            permit any action to be taken, which would result in it ceasing to

            of any of the Aircraft it receives shall have the Security Trustee
            as the named beneficiary. In the event that the relevant Export
            Lessee is entitled to make a claim under any such letter of credit
            it shall promptly notify the Security Trustee. The Security Trustee
            shall promptly thereafter take such action as shall be necessary to
            enable the relevant Export Lessee to make the relevant claim,
            provided that such Export Lessee shall ensure that any amounts paid
            under any such letters of credit shall be paid to such party and
            such amount as the Security Trustee shall direct; and

      (c)   observe the Mortgage registration covenant set forth in Clause 7.8
            as if the proviso thereto did not apply.

      requiring such Lessee to pay all monies payable at any time thereafter to
      an Export Lessee pursuant to the relevant Lease to such account as the
      Security Trustee shall direct in such notice.

9.3   Subject to no Termination Event having occurred and be continuing, in the
      event of an Export Lessee becoming obliged pursuant to the terms of any
      Lease to return any Lessee Security or Maintenance Reserve, or make any
      payment determined on the basis of the amount of any Lessee Security or
      Maintenance Reserve, to a Lessee, the Security Trustee shall return any
      such Lessee Security or Maintenance Reserve which it has received pursuant
      to Clause 9.1 or make such payment as directed by GFC subject to GFC
      having certified in writing to the Security Trustee that such Export
      Lessee has become so obliged.

9.4   At any time a Trigger Event shall cease to be continuing, provided no
      Termination Event shall not have occurred and be continuing, the Security
      Trustee shall promptly return to each Export Lessee all Lessee Security
      which it received pursuant to Clause 9.1 together with any powers of
      attorney that it may have received in respect of any letters of credit.
      The Security Trustee agrees to co-operate at GFC's cost in any steps
      required for any letters of credit issued in the name of the Security
      Trustee to be reissued in the name of the relevant Export Lessee or GFC,
      as shall be so requested.

      Trustee (in the ordinary course of business) in the Paris international
      exchange market on the date of receipt or, if it is not practicable to

        have been made pursuant to the relevant Transaction Document (the
        CURRENCY OF OBLIGATION) in whatever circumstances and for whatever
        reason shall only constitute a discharge to the relevant Obligor to the
        extent of the amount of the Currency of Obligation which the Agent, the
        Security Trustee or such Lender (as the case may be), is able or would
        have been able, on the date or dates of receipt by it of such payment or
        payments in the Currency of Payment (or, in the case of any such date
        which is not a Banking Day, on the next succeeding Banking Day), to
        purchase in the foreign exchange market of its choice with the amount or
        amounts of the Currency of Payment so received.

13.4.2  If the amount of the Currency of Obligation which the Agent, the
        Security Trustee or the relevant Lender is so able to purchase falls
        short of the amount originally due to such party hereunder, the relevant
        Obligor shall indemnify such party on demand against any loss or damage
        arising as a result of paying to such party that amount in the Currency
        of Obligation certified by such party as necessary to indemnify and hold
        it harmless.

13.4.3  If the amount of the Currency of Obligation which the Agent, Security
        Trustee or the relevant Lender is so able to purchase exceeds the amount
        originally due to such party hereunder, the Agent, Security Trustee or
        relevant Lender, as the case may be, shall pay the amount of such
        excess, net of any costs and expenses incurred by such party to the
        relevant Obligor.

13.5    TAX TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS

        Where any Obligor has an obligation to indemnify or reimburse any
        Indemnitee in respect of any Loss or Expense under the Transaction
        Document, the calculation of the amount payable by way of indemnity or
        reimbursement shall be based upon the Tax treatment in the hands of the
        Indemnitee (as determined by the Indemnitee acting in good faith) of the
        amount payable by way of indemnity or reimbursement and of such Loss or
        Expense in respect of which that amount is payable so as to leave the
        Indemnitee in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had
        the payment made to the Indemnitee not given rise to a Tax Liability and
        had the Loss or Expense incurred or payment made by the Indemnitee not
        been deductible for Tax purposes.

<PAGE>

13.6    NO DOUBLE-COUNTING

        No Lender or Representative shall be entitled, pursuant to the terms of
        any of the Transaction Documents, to recover by way of indemnity any
        Loss, Expense or Tax Liability to the extent that payment has previously
        been received and retained by it in respect of such Loss, Expense or Tax
        Liability under any other provision of any Transaction Document.

13.7    SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS

        Each of the indemnities contained in this Agreement, and each of the
        obligations of the Lenders and the Representatives with respect thereto,
        shall constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other
        obligations contained in this Agreement, shall give rise to a separate
        and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any
        indulgence granted by the Agent, the Security Trustee or any Lender from
        time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
        (a) the termination or expiry of this Agreement or (b) subject to the
        provisions of Clause 3.8 (LIMITED RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS OF THE
        BORROWERS), the satisfaction in full of all amounts owing to the
        Security Trustee, the Agent and each Lender under the Transaction
        Documents or (c) any judgment or order for a liquidated sum or sums in
        respect of amounts due hereunder or under any such judgment or order.

13.8    VALUE ADDED TAX

13.8.1  If any Indemnitee makes any supply to any Borrower or the
        Representatives for Value Added Tax purposes pursuant to or in
        connection with any of the Transaction Documents, the relevant Borrower
        shall (save to the extent that the relevant Indemnitee is entitled to be
        indemnified in respect of Value Added Tax by an increased payment under
        Clause 13.8.2) pay to the relevant Indemnitee within two (2) Business
        Days of demand an amount equal to any Value Added Tax which is payable
        in respect of that supply.

13.8.2  All payments made by any Borrower under the Transaction Documents are
        calculated without regard to Value Added Tax. If any such payment
        constitutes the whole or any part of the consideration for a taxable or
        deemed taxable supply to such Borrower or the Representatives by any
        Indemnitee, the amount of that payment shall be increased by an amount
        equal to the amount of Value Added Tax which is chargeable in respect of
        the taxable supply in question. The relevant Borrower's obligations
        under this Clause 13.8.2 shall be subject to the delivery to such
        Borrower on or before the due date for that payment of an invoice for
        Value Added Tax purposes made out in accordance with the applicable
        regulations.

13.8.3  No payment or other consideration to be made or furnished by any
        Indemnitee to a Borrower or any Representatives pursuant to or in
        connection with any of the Transaction Documents may be increased or
        added to by reference to (or as a result of any increase in the rate
        of) any Value Added Tax which shall be or may become chargeable in
        respect of the taxable supply in question.

13.8.4  If any Indemnitee makes any payment under, or as contemplated in, any of
        the Transaction Documents or in respect of any of the matters set out
        therein which bears or includes Value Added Tax which such Indemnitee
        determines to be irrecoverable by it, the relevant Borrower shall within
        five (5) Business Days of demand indemnify such Indemnitee for such
        Value Added Tax.

13.9    MITIGATION

        If any Indemnitee becomes aware of any event or circumstances which will
        result in it having to be indemnified pursuant to this Clause 13
        (INDEMNITIES), it will seek to consult with GFC with a view to avoiding
        or minimising any liability of an Obligor pursuant to Clause 13

                                    Page 55

<PAGE>

        (INDEMNITIES) provided that no Indemnitee shall be obliged to take or
        omit to take any action which it deems inappropriate at any point in
        time nor shall the failure of an Indemnitee for whatever reason to
        consult with GFC pursuant to this Clause 13.9 affect in any way the
        liability of any Obligor pursuant to this Clause 13 (INDEMNITIES).

14      CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

14.1    INCREASED COSTS

14.1.1  If a Change in Law shall:

        (a)     subject any Lender to any Tax in connection with its commitment
                to or participation in the Transaction or any part thereof
                (except for changes in the rate of Tax on the overall net income
                of such Lender or Representative or such Lender's Lending Office
                imposed by any Government Entity of the country in which such
                Lender or Representative is incorporated or in which such
                Lender's Lending Office is located); or

        (b)     change the basis of Taxation of any Lender in respect of
                payments of principal, interest or any other amount payable to
                any Lender in connection with the Transaction (except for
                changes in the rate of Tax on the overall net income of such
                Lender or Representative or such Lender's Lending Office imposed
                by any Government Entity of the country in which such Lender or
                Representative is incorporated or in which such Lender's Lending
                Office is located) (or the treatment for Taxation purposes of
                such payments); or

        (c)     impose or modify any reserve, cash ratio, special deposit,
                capital adequacy, liquidity or any other analogous requirement,
                or require the making of any special deposit, against or in
                respect of any assets or liabilities of, or deposit with or for
                the account of, or loan or commitment by, any Lender in relation
                to the Transaction; or

        (d)     change the manner in which any Lender is required by any
                regulatory authority to allocate capital resources in relation
                to the Transaction; or

        (e)     impose on any Lender any other condition directly affecting its
                participation in the Transaction,

        and the result of any of the foregoing is or will be (i) to increase the
        cost to such Lender of funding, making available or maintaining its
        participation in the Transaction or any part thereof or of funding,
        making or maintaining its participation in any Loan or (ii) to render
        such Lender unable to obtain the rate of return on its overall capital
        reasonably allocated to its obligations hereunder which it would have
        been able to obtain but for such Change in Law or (iii) to reduce any
        amount payable to such Lender by either Borrower hereunder or to reduce
        its return from the Transaction or any part thereof, then and in any
        such case:

                (i)     such Lender shall notify the relevant Borrower (through
                        the Agent);

                (ii)    the relevant Borrower shall pay from time to time to the
                        Agent (for the account of that Lender) within two (2)
                        Business Days of demand all amounts which that Lender
                        certifies are necessary to compensate that Lender for
                        such Tax or increase in cost or reduction in return or
                        reduction in the amount payable.

                                    Page 56

<PAGE>

        (f)     The provisions of Clause 14.1.1 shall not apply in respect of
                any Tax, increased cost, reduction in the rate of return or
                reduction in an amount payable to the extent that the same is a
                deduction or withholding Tax, Value Added Tax or documentary Tax
                (it being agreed that such Taxes are exclusively provided for
                elsewhere in this Agreement and are not covered by Clause
                14.1.1).

14.2    MARKET DISRUPTION

        (a)     If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to a Loan for
                any Interest Period, then the rate of interest on each Lender's
                share of that Loan for the Interest Period shall be the rate per
                annum which is the sum of:

                (i)     the applicable Margin;

                (ii)    the rate notified to the Agent by that Lender as soon as
                        practicable and in any event before interest is due to
                        be paid in respect of that Interest Period, to be that
                        which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost
                        to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan
                        from whatever source it may reasonably select; and

                (iii)   the applicable ECA Premium.

        (b)     In this Agreement MARKET DISRUPTION EVENT means at or about noon
                on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period the
                Telerate Screen (as used in the EURIBOR and LIBOR definition)
                and Reuters are not quoting LIBOR or EURIBOR, as the case may
                be, and none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate
                to the Agent to determine LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR for
                the relevant currency and Interest Period.

        (c)     If a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Agent or GFC so
                requires, the Agent and GFC shall enter into negotiations (for a
                period of not more than thirty days) with a view to agreeing a
                substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.

        (d)     Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (c) above
                shall, with the prior consent of all the Lenders and the
                Borrowers, be binding on all Parties.

14.3    ILLEGALITY

        If, at any time, as a result of a Change in Law:

        (a)     it is or it will become unlawful for any Lender (the AFFECTED
                LENDER), to make, fund or allow to remain outstanding any part
                of its Commitment or its participation in the Facility or any
                Loan; or

        (b)     any Transaction Document shall cease or will cease to remain in
                full force and effect in whole or in part or shall become void
                or invalid or unenforceable or the repayment of any Loan or the
                payment of interest at the stated non default rate on any Loan
                shall become illegal,

        then the Agent or any Affected Lender may deliver to the Borrowers
        (through the Agent) a notice to that effect, whereupon, subject to
        Clause 15 (MITIGATION), each relevant Borrower shall forthwith prepay
        each Loan affected by the relevant circumstances together with all
        interest accrued thereon and all other amounts due and payable to the
        Lenders and the Representatives in respect of each such Loan or the
        relevant Aircraft pursuant to this Agreement or any relevant Aircraft
        Operative Document together with any ECA Breakage

                                    Page 57

<PAGE>

        Costs in relation to each such Loan and any Expenses incurred by the
        Representative or the Agent.

15      MITIGATION

15.1    MITIGATION

15.1.1  If circumstances arise which result, or upon the giving of notice would
        result, in the operation of Clause 4.12 (DEDUCTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS) or
        Clause 14.1 (INCREASED COSTS) to the detriment of any Borrower, each
        Affected Lender shall promptly, upon becoming aware of the same, notify
        the relevant Borrower with a copy to the Agent and the relevant Export
        Lessee (in this Clause 15.1 the AFFECTED BORROWER) and upon the written
        request of the relevant Export Lessee shall negotiate in good faith with
        the Affected Borrower and the relevant Export Lessee for a period not
        exceeding thirty (30) days with a view to avoiding or minimising the
        relevant duty, tax, fee or charge including, in the case of a Lender, a
        change in its Lending Office or a transfer of its participation in the
        Loans and its Commitments to another bank or financial institution.

15.1.2  Without limiting or reducing the obligations of the Obligors (or any of
        them) under Clause 4.12 (DEDUCTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS), Clause 14.1
        (INCREASED COSTS), or Clause 14.3 (ILLEGALITY), in relation to Clauses
        4.12 (DEDUCTIONS AND WITHHOLDINGS), 14.1 (INCREASED COSTS) and 14.3
        (Illegality), no Lender or Representative shall have any obligation to
        take any action under Clause 15.1.1 if, in its good faith opinion, to do
        so would be likely to (a) have an adverse effect upon its business,
        operation or financial condition, or (b) result in its rights,
        interests, anticipated financial return or position under or in relation
        to any of the Transaction Documents being materially less favourable to
        it than would have been the case in the absence of such action unless
        indemnified or secured to its satisfaction in respect thereof, or (c)
        involve it in any unlawful act or activity or any act or activity that
        is contrary to any official directive, concession, guideline, request or
        requirement of any competent authority (whether or not having the force
        of law but, in the case only of any of the same not having the force of
        law, in respect of which it is the practice of banks or other
        institutions of a similar nature to the relevant Lender or
        Representative (as the case may be), generally to comply with the same),
        or (d) (unless indemnified or secured to its satisfaction) involve it in
        any additional Tax Liability or any expense or (e) unless protected by
        confidentiality procedures involve it in any disclosure of any document
        or information relating to its business or affairs which it considers
        (in its good faith opinion) to be of a confidential nature.

15.1.3  If the circumstances referred to in Clause 14.3 (ILLEGALITY) arise, upon
        the written request of the relevant Export Lessee or the Agent, the
        Affected Borrower and the relevant Export Lessee and the Representatives
        shall negotiate in good faith for a period not exceeding thirty (30)
        days (or such shorter period as may be required by law) with a view to
        restructuring each affected Loan and rectifying and amending the
        relevant Transaction Documents in order to mitigate the effect of the
        relevant Change in Law and the Affected Borrower shall pay for the
        Expenses incurred by the Representatives for such negotiations as well
        as (if alternative arrangements are agreed) to complete all steps
        required to implement such restructuring and all rectifications and
        amendments to the relevant Transaction Documents in relation to each
        Loan affected by the circumstances referred to in Clause 14.3
        (ILLEGALITY). If a resolution acceptable to the relevant Export Lessee,
        the other relevant Obligors and the Representatives is obtained as a
        result of this mitigation procedure, the relevant Export Lessee shall
        implement the restructuring, rectification and amendments referred to in
        this Clause 15.1.3 to the relevant Transaction Documents, to the
        satisfaction of the Agent, within thirty (30) days from the earlier of
        the date when such resolution is reached and the date upon which the
        period of thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as required by law)
        is referred to in this Clause 15.1.3 expires. If the Affected Borrower
        fails to implement such rectification and amendment to the

                                    Page 58

<PAGE>

        relevant Transaction Documents within such period, the Affected Borrower
        shall prepay each Loan to which Clause 14.3 (ILLEGALITY) applies in
        accordance with such Clause.

15.1.4  If any Export Credit Agency were to become a Lender, the provisions of
        Clause 14 (CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES) and this Clause 15 shall not apply
        to such Export Credit Agency.

15.2    PREPAYMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS AND REPLACEMENT OF AFFECTED LENDER

15.2.1  If the circumstances referred to in Clauses 4.12 (DEDUCTIONS AND
        WITHHOLDINGS), 14.1 (INCREASED COSTS) or 14.3 (ILLEGALITY) arise, and
        no resolution acceptable to the parties is obtained as a result of the
        mitigation procedure referred to in Clause 15.1 (MITIGATION), in each
        case with respect to a Lender (in this Clause 15.2 an AFFECTED LENDER)
        the relevant Borrower in this Clause 15.2 (the AFFECTED BORROWER) shall
        pay to the Agent (for the account of each Affected Lender) each Affected
        Lender's Relevant Proportion of each Loan affected by such circumstances
        together with all accrued interest thereon, the ECA Breakage Costs and
        Expenses owing to the Affected Lender in connection with any such Loan
        or under this Agreement or the relevant Transaction Documents.

15.2.2

        (a)     If the Affected Borrower (acting on the instructions of the
                relevant Export Lessee) wishes to make any payment referred to
                in Clause 15.2.1, such payment shall be treated as a voluntary
                prepayment and accordingly the provisions of Clause 4.3
                (VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT) shall apply and in particular the
                Affected Borrower shall comply with provisions of Clause 4.3.1
                (VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT) (other than the giving of not less than
                ten (10) Business Days' notice pursuant to Clause 4.3.1) and
                4.3.3 (VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT) in relation to any such payment
                referred to in Clause 15.2.1.

        (b)     The Agent shall as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt
                of the Affected Borrower's prepayment notice, unless the
                Affected Borrower elects to prepay the entire Loan in relation
                to an Aircraft, prepare a substitute schedule for schedule 2 to
                the relevant Loan Supplement showing new amounts for the
                repayment of the relevant Loan for the period following such
                prepayment calculated on the same basis and assumptions (other
                than the assumption as to the total principal amount of the
                relevant Loan) as were used for the purpose of preparing the
                original schedule 2 to such Loan Supplement. Upon the Affected
                Borrower and each National Agent agreeing to the same, such
                substitute Schedules shall become for all purposes schedule 2 to
                the relevant Loan Supplement and shall be binding on all parties
                with effect from the date of the prepayment.

16      FEES AND EXPENSES

16.1    TRANSACTION EXPENSES OF FINANCE PARTIES

        The relevant GATX Obligor shall pay to the Agent within five (5)
        Business Days of demand (whether or not any Utilisation Documentation is
        entered into and/or any amount is disbursed under this Agreement) all
        Expenses incurred by the Finance Parties and the Export Credit Agencies:

        (a)     in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
                registration and implementation of each of the Transaction
                Documents and the other documents contemplated hereby or thereby
                or at any time hereafter and the delivery of the Aircraft
                (including the Expenses of the Agent's legal counsel in
                connection with the

<PAGE>

                preparation of each Aircraft Operative Document and the
                collection of the conditions precedent listed in Schedule 6, in
                respect of each Utilisation but subject to the separate

18.2    TRANSFERS BY LENDERS

        Any Lender may transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and
        obligations under this Agreement or change its Lending Office (whether
        in the same or a different jurisdiction) provided always that:

        (a)     prior to the transfer or change in Lending Office becoming
                effective, the relevant Lender gives notice to GFC (with a copy
                to the Agent) of the identity of the Transferee or (as the case
                may be), the new Lending Office and the jurisdiction of tax
                residence of the Transferee or (as the case may be), the new
                Lending Office;

        (b)     the Transferee (i) is a subsidiary or affiliate of the
                transferor which is eligible for support from the applicable
                Export Credit Agency or Agencies or (ii) is an Export Credit
                Agency or (iii) is eligible for support from each of the Export
                Credit Agencies and has been approved as a Transferee by GFC
                (such approval, in the case of any transfer proposed to take
                effect at any time after the Facility has ceased to be available
                for Utilisation, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or
                (iv) is eligible for support from each of the Export Credit
                Agencies and is designated as a Transferee by the relevant

        (d)     the Transferee is neither resident in the United Kingdom for
                United Kingdom tax purposes nor controlled by persons who are so
                resident if the transfer to the Transferee would result in
                Advances of Lenders resident in the United Kingdom for United
                Kingdom tax purposes or controlled by persons who are so
                resident constituting 50 per cent, (or more than 40 per cent. if
                a further 40 per cent. is held by another person or persons
                acting together) or more of the Advances as at the date of the
                proposed transfer; and

        (e)     all costs and expenses of the Transfer shall be borne by the
                transferring Lender and, with the exception of transfers
                occurring as a result of sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iv) of Clause
                18.2(b), no Obligor shall be under any obligation to pay any
                greater amount or suffer any other increase in liabilities or
                diminution in right or benefit under the Transaction Documents
                following and as a consequence (directly or indirectly) of any
                such transfer or change in Lending Office,

        PROVIDED further that the provisos set out above shall not apply to the
        extent that any Lender has so assigned or transferred its Relevant

18.3    TRANSFER CERTIFICATES

18.3.1  If any Lender (the Transferor) transfers all or any part of its rights,
        benefits and/or obligations under the Transaction Documents to another
        bank or financial institution (the Transferee), such transfer shall be
        effected by way of a novation by the delivery to, and the execution by,
        the Agent of a duly completed Transfer Certificate or in such other
        manner as all parties hereto may agree.

18.3.1  On the date specified in the Transfer Certificate:

        (a)     to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Transferor
                seeks to transfer its rights and obligations hereunder, each of
                the Obligors and the Transferor shall each be released from
                further obligations to each other under this Agreement and their
                respective rights against each other shall be cancelled (such
                rights and obligations being referred to in this Clause 18.3 as
                DISCHARGED RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS);

        (b)     the Agent, the Joint Arrangers, the Lenders, the Security
                Trustee and each of the Obligors and the Transferee shall each
                assume obligations towards each other and/or acquire rights
                against each other which, subject to Clause 18.2 above, differ
                from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as, each
                of the Obligors and the Transferee have assumed and/or acquired
                the same in place of each of the Obligors and the Transferor;

        (c)     the Agent, the Joint Arrangers, the Security Trustee, each of
                the Obligors, the Transferee and the other Lenders shall acquire
                the same rights and assume the same obligations among themselves
                as they would have acquired and assumed had the Transferee
                originally been a party hereunder as a Lender with the rights
                and/or the obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of
                the transfer; and

        (d)     the Transferee, the Agent, the Security Trustee, the Joint
                Arrangers and each of the other Lenders shall acquire the same
                rights and assume the same obligations amongst themselves as
                they would have acquired and assumed had the Transferee
                originally been a party to this Agreement as a Lender in the
                place of the Transferor.

18.3.3  Each Obligor hereby confirms that the execution of any such Transfer
        Certificate by the Agent on its behalf shall be binding upon and
        enforceable against it as if it had executed the Transfer Certificate
        itself,

18.3.4  The Agent shall promptly complete a Transfer Certificate on written
        request by a Transferor and upon payment by the Transferee (other than
        in the case of an Export Credit Agency (or a Transferee nominated
        thereby) being a Transferee) of a fee of US$1,000 to the Agent. Each of
        the Lenders, the Joint Arrangers and the Security Trustee hereby
        irrevocably authorises the Agent and each Obligor hereby irrevocably
        authorises the Agent to execute any duly completed Transfer Certificate
        on its behalf provided that such authorisation does not extend to the
        execution of a Transfer Certificate on behalf of either the Transferor
        or the Transferee named therein.

18.4    COSTS AND EXPENSES

        In relation to any transfer contemplated by this Clause 18 which is
        undertaken voluntarily by any Lender (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
        not a transfer pursuant to Clause 15 (Mitigation), the costs and
        expenses thereby incurred by the Agent, the Security Trustee , the
        Export Credit Agencies and each Lender shall be for the account of the
        Transferee or the Transferor (as they may agree between themselves).

18.5    CREDIT SALE AGREEMENT TRANSFERS/REGISTERED AGREEMENT

18.5.1  Each Credit Sale Agreement is a registered agreement. A manually signed
        copy of each Credit Sale Agreement and the corresponding Head Lessor
        Register (as defined in Clause 18.5.2) shall be the only evidence of a
        Borrower's rights under such Credit Sale Agreement. Each Credit Sale
        Agreement is not a bearer instrument.

18.5.2  At the expense of the relevant Export Lessee, the Security Trustee
        agrees to keep, on behalf of the relevant Export Lessee in respect of
        each Credit Sale Agreement, a record of ownership (the HEAD LESSOR
        REGISTER) (in the form provided to it by the relevant Export Lessee) in
        which it will record by book entry (and record by book entry any
        transfer of) the relevant Borrower's right, title and interest in such
        Credit Sale Agreement and in the rights to receive payments in
        accordance with the terms of such Credit Sale Agreement.

18.5.3  No transfer by a Borrower of all or any part of its interest in any
        Credit Sale Agreement or in any of its rights to receive any payments
        pursuant to the relevant Credit Sale Agreement shall be permitted unless
        a book entry of such transfer is made upon the Head Lessor Register.

18.5.4  A Borrower may only transfer its interest in any Credit Sale Agreement
        and its light to receive any payments pursuant to such Credit Sale
        Agreement only by giving written notice to the Security Trustee stating
        the name of the proposed transferee. No such transfer shall be effective
        until, and such transferee shall succeed to the rights of the relevant
        Borrower under the relevant Credit Sale Agreement only upon, entry of
        such transfer by the Security Trustee in the Head Lessor Register. The
        party identified in the Head Lessor Register as the "Head Lessor" under
        the relevant Credit Sale Agreement shall be treated as the owner of the
        relevant Borrower's interest in and rights under the relevant Credit
        Sale Agreement for all purposes.

19      SET-OFF AND PRO RATA PAYMENTS

19.1    SET-OFF

19.1.1  Each Lender and each of the Representatives may, at any time during the
        continuance of a Termination Event, set off from any sum payable by it
        to any one or more of the Obligors under any of the Transaction
        Documents any sum due and unpaid by the relevant Obligor to such Lender
        or Representative in each case under or in relation to any of the
        Transaction Documents and any document or agreement entered into
        pursuant to or in connection with any of the Transaction Documents.

19.1.2  No Obligor shall be entitled to deduct any sum which may be due to it
        from the Lenders (or any of them) howsoever arising from any sum payable
        by such Obligor under or in connection with any of the Transaction
        Documents.

19.1.3  No Obligor shall be entitled to refuse or to postpone performance of any
        payment or other obligation under any of the Transaction Documents by
        reason of any claim which it may have or may consider that it has
        against (i) the Lenders (or any of them) under or in connection with any
        of the Transaction Documents, or any other agreement with any of the
        Lenders and/or (ii) any other party under or in connection with any of
        the Transaction Documents.

19.2    PRO-RATA SHARING

19.2.1  If a Lender (SHARING LENDER) receives or recovers any amount pursuant to
        the Transaction Documents by voluntary or involuntary payment, set-off
        or any other manner other than through the Agent in accordance with
        Clause 12 (APPLICATION OF SUMS RECEIVED), then:

                                    Page 63

<PAGE>

        (a)     the Sharing Lender shall immediately notify the Agent of the
                amount received or recovered and the manner of its receipt of
                recovery;

        (b)     the Agent shall determine whether the amount discharged is in
                excess of the amount which the Sharing Lender would have
                received had the amount discharged been received by the Agent
                and distributed in accordance with Clause 12 (APPLICATION OF
                SUMS RECEIVED);

        (c)     the Sharing Lender shall pay the Agent an amount equal to that
                excess (The EXCESS AMOUNT) within 5 Business Days of demand by
                the Agent;

        (d)     the Agent shall treat the Excess Amount as it were a payment by
                an Obligor under Clause 12 (APPLICATION OF SUMS RECEIVED) and
                shall pay the Excess Amount to the Lenders (other than the
                Sharing Lender) in accordance with Clause 12 (APPLICATION OF
                SUMS RECEIVED); and

        (e)     as between the relevant Borrower and the Sharing Lender the
                Excess Amount shall be treated as not having been received or
                recovered, and accordingly such Borrower shall owe the Sharing
                Lender an immediately payable debt equal to the Excess Amount.

19.2.2  Notwithstanding Clause 19.2.1 no Sharing Lender shall (i) be obliged to
        share any Excess Amount which it receives or recovers pursuant to legal
        proceedings taken by it to recover any sums owing to it under the
        Transaction Documents with any other Lender which has a legal right to,
        but does not, either join in such proceedings or commence and diligently
        pursue separate proceedings to enforce its rights, unless the
        proceedings instituted by the Sharing Lender are instituted by it
        without prior notice having been given to such Lender through the Agent
        and an opportunity to such Lender to join in such proceedings or (ii) no
        Lender shall be obliged to exercise any right of set-off it may have
        against any or all of the Obligors at any time, or to set-off against
        any obligations of any of the Obligors in relation to the Transaction
        Documents any sum which such Lender may hold on deposit or otherwise
        from any Obligor, or any other right against any Obligor in favour of
        such Lender which sum has been received or right has arisen unrelated to
        and independent from the Transaction.

19.2.3  If any Excess Amount subsequently has to be wholly or partially refunded
        to an Obligor by a Sharing Lender which has paid an amount equal to that
        Excess Amount to the Agent under Clause 19.2.1, each Lender to which any
        part of that amount was distributed shall on request from the Sharing
        Lender repay to the Sharing Lender that Lender's proportionate share of
        the amount which has to be so refunded by the Sharing Bank.

19.2.4  Each Lender shall on request supply to the Agent such information as the
        Agent may from time to time request for the purpose of this Clause 19.2.

        Any failure to exercise, or any delay in exercising, on the part of any
        Representative or Lender any right under any Transaction Document shall
        not operate as a waiver or variation of that or any other right and any
        defective or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude any
        other or further exercise of that or any other right, and no act or
        course of conduct or negotiation shall in any way preclude any party
        hereto from exercising any such right or constitute a suspension or any
        variation of any such right.

        If at any time any provision hereof is or becomes illegal, invalid or
        unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction, neither

23      GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

23.1    This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with
        English law.

23.2    Each Obligor irrevocably agrees for the benefit of each Finance Party
        that the courts of England shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine
        any suit, action or proceeding, and to settle any disputes, which may
        arise out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other
        Transaction Document and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to the
        jurisdiction of such courts.

23.3    Each party irrevocably waives any objection which it might now or
        hereafter have to the courts referred to in Clause 23.2 being nominated
        as the forum to hear and determine any suit, action or proceeding, and
        to settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with
        this Agreement or any other Transaction Document and agrees not to claim
        that any such court is not a convenient or appropriate forum in each
        case whether on the grounds of venue or forum non conveniens or any
        similar grounds or otherwise.

23.4    For the purpose of any suit, action, proceeding or settlement of dispute
        in the English courts (whether under this Agreement or any other
        Transaction Document), each Obligor:

        (a)     appoints the agent specified in Schedule 7 to accept service of
                process in respect of any such suit, action, proceeding or
                settlement of dispute;

        (b)     confirms that such agent is willing to accept service of such
                process on its behalf in respect of this Agreement and the other
                Transaction Documents; and

        (c)     if the agent specified in Schedule 7 no longer serves as its
                agent, shall promptly appoint another such agent acceptable to
                the Agent and advise the Agent thereof.

23.5    The submission to the jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Clause
        23.2 shall not (and shall not be construed so as to) limit the right of
        any Finance Party to take proceedings against any Obligor in any other
        court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of proceedings in
        any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of proceedings in any
        other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not to the extent permitted
        by Applicable Law.

23.6    To the extent that any Obligor or any of the property of any Obligor is
        or becomes entitled at any time to any immunity on the grounds of
        sovereignty or otherwise from any legal action, suit or proceeding, from
        set-off or counterclaim, from the jurisdiction of any competent court,
        from service of process, from attachment prior to judgment, from
        attachment in aid of execution, or from execution prior to judgment, or
        other legal process in any jurisdiction, each such Obligor, for itself
        and its property, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and
        agrees not to plead or claim, any such immunity with respect to its
        obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out of or
        in connection with any of the Transaction Documents.

24      MISCELLANEOUS

24.1    A certificate given by any Finance Party as to the amount of any sum
        required to be paid to it under any provisions of this Agreement or any
        of the other Transaction Documents (including any Termination Amount)
        shall, save in the case of manifest error, be prima facie evidence of
        the amounts therein stated for all purposes of this Agreement and any of
        the other Transaction Documents.

24.2    The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that this Agreement shall
        continue in full force and effect for all purposes until all Secured
        Loan Obligations have been paid in full notwithstanding that the
        Commitments may at any time be reduced to zero.

24.3    Each of the parties hereto agrees that no amendments, variations,
        supplements or modifications may be made to any of the Transaction
        Documents other than by an instrument in writing executed by the
        applicable Obligor(s) and the Agent or the Security Trustee as provided
        in the applicable Transaction Document, or where expressly provided in
        the applicable Transaction Document, the Agent on behalf and on the
        instructions of the Majority Lenders (which consent shall not be
        unreasonably withheld).

24.4    Each of the Obligors hereby acknowledges and accepts that under the
        Support Agreements, the Export Credit Agencies have certain rights to
        require the Lenders, the Agent and/or the Security Trustee to act, or to
        omit to act, in accordance with the instructions of the Export Credit
        Agencies. Accordingly, each of the Obligors hereby acknowledges and
        accepts that if any of the Lenders, the Agent and/or (as the case may
        be), the Security Trustee have to exercise a right, discretion or power
        under any of the Transaction Documents "reasonably", "in good faith" or
        "bona fide" or with any other restriction of whatsoever nature then such
        Lender, the Agent and/or (as the case may be), the Security Trustee will
        be deemed to be acting "reasonably", "in good faith" or "bona fide" or
        in accordance with such other restrictions (as the case may be) if such
        Lender, the Agent and/or the Security Trustee exercises, or refrains
        from exercising, such right, discretion or power in accordance with the
        instructions of the relevant Export Credit Agency.

25      CONFIDENTIALITY

25.1    At all times during the Security Period and after the termination
        thereof, each party hereto shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure
        that its respective officer's, directors, employees and agents shall
        keep secret and confidential and not, without the prior written consent
        of GFC, the Agent and the Security Trustee, disclose to any third party
        the terms of any of the Transaction Documents, any Lease, Sub-Lease,
        Insurances, or Airbus Purchase Agreements or any of the information,
        reports, invoices, or documents supplied by or on behalf of any of the
        other parties hereto, save that any such party shall be entitled to
        disclose any such terms, information, reports or documents:

                connection with any of the Transaction Documents to the extent
                that such party may consider necessary to protect its interest;
                or

        (b)     to any potential permitted assignee or transferee of all or any
                of such party's rights under any of the Transaction Documents or

                arrangements with such party in relation to or in connection
                with the transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction
                Documents, subject to it obtaining an undertaking from such
                potential permitted assignee or permitted other person in the
                terms similar to this Clause 25.1; or

        (c)     if required to do so by an order of a court of competent
                jurisdiction whether in pursuance of any procedure for
                discovering documents or otherwise; or

        (d)     pursuant to any law or regulation having the force of law

                information confidential); or

25.2    In addition, any party shall be entitled to disclose or use any such
        information, reports or documents if the information contained therein
        shall have emanated in conditions free from confidentiality bona fide
        from some person other than the relevant party hereto and such party
        would, but for the preceding provisions of this Clause 25 have been free
        to disclose or use the same.

25.3    Each party may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 25,
        release to any potential assignee or transferee (permitted in each case
        pursuant hereto or to the relevant Transaction Document), or other
        person proposing to enter into contractual arrangements with such party
        in relation to or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
        any of the Transaction Documents, a copy of any of the Transaction
        Documents, provided that each such potential assignee or transferee or
        other person confirms in writing to the other parties to this Agreement
        that it is bound by the terms of this Clause 25 as if it had been a
        party to this Agreement.

26      COUNTERPARTS

        This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
        different parties thereto on separate counterparts and any single
        counterpart or set of counterparts signed, in either case, by all the
        parties hereto shall be deemed to constitute a full and original
        agreement for all purposes but all counterparts shall constitute but one
        and the same instrument.

            (ii)  Set-off and Counterclaim

                  The Lessee's obligation to pay rental and make other payments
                  in accordance with the Permitted Lease will be absolute and

      (e)   Maintenance Reserves and Security Deposit

            The Lessee will be required to pay airframe and (unless and for such

                  acknowledge to the relevant Export Lessee that (save as may be
                  permitted hereby) the relevant Export Lessee gives no
                  warranties, representations or guarantees of any kind with
                  respect to the Aircraft.

            (ii)  If the Lessee so requires or, if the Applicable Law limits the
                  extent to which such acknowledgement may be given, such
                  acknowledgement may be qualified so that it is given only to
                  the extent permitted by applicable law.

<PAGE>

            (iii) The Lessee's obligation to accept delivery of the Aircraft may
                  be conditional on the Lessee having satisfied itself as to the
                  condition thereof or as to compliance with any specific
                  criteria prior to the execution of its certificate of
                  acceptance.

            (iv)  The relevant Export Lessee may warrant or undertake to the
                  Lessee that the Aircraft will comply with certain specific
                  factual criteria, provided such warranty or undertaking is
                  satisfied or discharged by the Lessee's acceptance of the
                  Aircraft upon the execution of the Lease acceptance
                  certificate (or, if the Lessee agrees to accept delivery
                  notwithstanding non-compliance, provided the relevant Export
                  Lessee undertakes to rectify such non-compliance (or provide
                  appropriate compensation)).

      (g)   Operational and Other Undertakings

            (i)   The Permitted Lease shall (1) contain provisions corresponding
                  in all material respects with those stated in Clauses 12 and
                  13 of the Model Lease Agreement (Operational Undertakings by
                  the Lessee and Maintenance and Repair) (the "MODEL LEASE
                  AGREEMENT" being the form of model lease agreement approved by
                  the National Agents prior to execution of this Agreement and
                  as initialled by the Agent and GFC) amended to the extent GFC
                  considers appropriate acting in accordance with the Standard
                  and (2) require that the Lessee obtain all necessary consents,
                  approvals and authorizations in connection with its leasing of
                  the relevant Aircraft thereunder.

            (ii)  The Permitted Lease shall require that the Lessee shall (1)
                  operate the Aircraft in accordance with all Applicable Laws,
                  (2) obtain and maintain all licenses, consents and permits
                  reasonably necessary in connection with its operation of the
                  Aircraft, (3) discharge all Liens from the Aircraft other than
                  Permitted Liens and (4) during the lease term, provide
                  periodic reports on the utilisation and status of the
                  Aircraft, Airframe and the Engines in such form as may be
                  agreed by GFC in accordance with the Standard.

      (h)   Indemnities

            The Permitted Lease shall contain provisions corresponding in all
            material respects with those stated in Clause 9 of the Model Lease
            Agreement (Expenses and Indemnities) amended to the extent GFC
            considers appropriate acting in accordance with the Standard.

      (i)   Insurance

            The insurance obligations of the Lessee under the Permitted Lease
            shall mutatis mutandis correspond and comply in all material
            respects with those stated in Clause 16 (Insurances) of the Model
            Lease Agreement, except that the Lessor may agree amendments to such
            provisions which are consistent with the Standard but which:

            (i)   are required because the relevant provisions would otherwise
                  contain a requirement not available in the market; and

            (ii)  will not and are not likely adversely to prejudice the Finance
                  Parties.

      (j)   Representations and Warranties

            The Lessee shall represent and warrant to the relevant Export
            Lessee:

                                    Page 85

<PAGE>

            (i)   concerning the Lessee's corporate standing or legal status;

            (ii)  that the Permitted Lease has been duly authorised and executed
                  by the Lessee; and

            (iii) that the Permitted Lease constitutes legal, valid and binding
                  obligations of the Lessee (if the Lessee so requires, this
                  representation and warranty may (to the extent appropriate in
                  accordance with the Standard) be qualified by reference to the
                  qualifications in the legal opinion relating to the Permitted
                  Lease).

      (k)   General Reporting

            The Permitted Lease shall require that the Lessee provide the
            following information:

            (i)   annual audited financial statements of the Lessee or, if the
                  Lessee's obligations are guaranteed by a more creditworthy
                  entity, the guarantor under such guarantee;

            (ii)  notice of any Total Loss of the Aircraft, Airframe or any
                  Engine; and

            (iii) notice of any other loss event with respect to the Aircraft,
                  Airframe or any Engine not amounting to a Total Loss if the
                  estimated cost of repair exceeds an amount determined in
                  accordance with the Standard.

      (l)   Redelivery of the Aircraft

            The redelivery obligations of the Lessee shall be consistent with
            the Standard and shall correspond and comply in all material
            respects with the following provisions:

            (i)   Date of Redelivery:

                  The Lessee will be obliged to redeliver the Aircraft and all
                  Technical Records to the relevant Export Lessee on the
                  expiration or earlier termination of the lease term (in this
                  Schedule 5, EXPIRY).

            (ii)  Technical Reporting:

                  At or prior to the Expiry, the Lessee will provide the
                  relevant Export Lessee with all technical information
                  reasonably requested by the relevant Export Lessee regarding
                  the Aircraft.

            (iii) Redelivery Location:

                  On the Expiry, the Aircraft shall be technically accepted by
                  the relevant Export Lessee at such airport as may be mutually
                  agreed to by the Lessee and the Export Lessee. At such time,
                  the relevant Export Lessee and the Lessee shall execute a
                  return acceptance certificate.

            (iv)  Aircraft Inspection:

                  The Permitted Lease will oblige the Lessee immediately prior
                  to the proposed redelivery of the Aircraft, to carry out for
                  the relevant Export Lessee and/or the relevant Export Lessee's
                  representatives a demonstration flight of the Aircraft for a
                  period of not greater than two (2) hours.

                                    Page 86
<PAGE>

            (v)   Certificate of Airworthiness Matters:

                  The Aircraft will possess a current certificate of
                  airworthiness issued by the Aviation Authority.

            (vi)  General Condition of Aircraft at Redelivery

                  (aa)  The Aircraft shall be in the same working order,
                        condition and appearance as when received pursuant to
                        the Permitted Lease (reasonable wear from normal airline
                        flight operations excepted), with all pilot
                        discrepancies and deferred maintenance items cleared,
                        clean by international commercial airline standards and
                        ready for flight with all of the Aircraft equipment,
                        components and systems operating within limits specified
                        in the maintenance manual and functioning in accordance
                        with their intended use. The Aircraft shall be free and
                        clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

                  (bb)  The Permitted Lease will oblige the Lessee to redeliver
                        the Aircraft to the relevant Export Lessee with the same
                        equipment as at the commencement of the Permitted Lease,
                        subject only to those additions and modifications which
                        may have been made and properly documented pursuant to
                        the Permitted Lease or as otherwise specifically
                        approved in writing by the relevant Export Lessee.

                  (cc)  The Permitted Lease will provide that, at redelivery,
                        the Lessee will carry out all inspections and checks
                        then required on the Aircraft in accordance with the
                        Maintenance Programme, including the next sequential
                        C-Check (as defined in the Model Lease Agreement). All
                        such inspections and checks must be carried out by an
                        authorised maintenance performer. All discrepancies
                        discovered during such inspections and checks shall be
                        rectified to the relevant Export Lessee's satisfaction.

            (vii) Export and Deregistration of Aircraft:

                  The Permitted Lease will provide that at the relevant Export
                  Lessee's request, the Lessee will (i) assist in providing an
                  export certificate of airworthiness or its equivalent from the
                  State of Registration so that the Aircraft can be exported to
                  the country designated by the relevant Export Lessee, and (ii)
                  assist with de-registration of the Aircraft from the register
                  of aircraft in the State of Registration.

      (m)   Lease Event of Default

            The relevant Export Lessee shall be expressly entitled by the
            Permitted Lease to terminate the leasing of the Aircraft by the
            Lessee, and to repossess the same, at any time after the expiration
            of the agreed grace period or remedy period, if any, of the
            occurrence of certain events, which will be broadly consistent with
            those set out in Clause 20 of such Model Lease Agreement, amended
            mutatis mutandis to reflect the change in Lessee, but in any event
            including in such events, failure of the concerned Lessee to pay
            amounts payable by it thereunder or to affect Insurances in
            accordance with the requirements of the relevant Permitted Lease or
            the bankruptcy of such

                                    Page 87

<PAGE>

            Lessee. The relevant Export Lessee may negotiate with the applicable
            Lessee additional exceptions and qualifications which are consistent
            with the Standard.

      (n)   Assignment

            No assignment, novation, transfer, mortgage or other charge may be
            made by the Lessee of any of its rights with respect to the
            Airframe, any Engine or any Part or under the Permitted Lease.

      (o)   Governing Law

            The relevant Export Lessee shall attempt to procure that the
            governing law of the Permitted Lease shall be English law or New
            York law. However, the governing law may be the law of another
            country if the legal opinion (of counsel qualified in such country)
            states that the Permitted Lease constitutes binding and enforceable
            obligations of the Lessee under such law (such opinion may be
            subject to qualifications acceptable to the Lessor, acting in
            accordance with the Standard).

      (p)   Additional Documents

            Any ancillary documents or letter agreements entered into by the
            relevant Export Lessee with the Lessee shall not contain any
            provisions which conflict with or qualify the provisions of this
            Schedule.

      (q)   Required Insurance Value

            The amount payable by the Lessee to the relevant Export Lessee under
            the Permitted Lease at any time on the consequence of a Total Loss
            of the Aircraft will not be less than the Required Insurance Value
            with respect to such Aircraft at such time.

PART 2 OPERATIONAL UNDERTAKINGS

       "OPERATIONAL UNDERTAKINGS" means the following:

      (a)   Possession

            (i)   The relevant Aircraft and the operations performed therewith
                  shall, subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations of
                  the Aviation Authority, be under the exclusive control of the
                  relevant Export Lessee or GFC or the duly authorised and
                  qualified agents of the relevant Export Lessee or GFC.

            (ii)  The relevant Export Lessee shall not without the prior written
                  consent of the Security Trustee (no such consent to be
                  unreasonably withheld or delayed), deliver, relinquish or
                  transfer possession of the relevant Aircraft except to a
                  Lessee pursuant to a Permitted Lease or except for transfer of
                  possession and replacement of Parts as provided in the
                  Replacement of Parts, Alterations, Modifications and Additions
                  Undertakings provided, however, that, so long as no
                  Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the
                  relevant Export Lessee may, subject to (e) below),

                  (aa)  deliver possession of the relevant Aircraft, any Engine
                        or any Part thereof to an authorised maintenance
                        performer for service, repair, maintenance or overhaul
                        work required by the terms hereof, or for modifications,
                        alterations or additions permitted by the provisions of
                        this Agreement, or

<PAGE>

                  (bb)  install an Engine on any other Airframe, or

                  (cc)  subject any Engine to normal interchange or pooling
                        agreements or arrangements customary in the airline
                        industry which pooling or interchange shall not
                        constitute a waiver of any right or remedies of any
                        Finance Party,

                  (dd)  provided that no agreement or arrangement described in
                        (aa), (bb) or (cc) above contemplates or requires the
                        transfer of title to any Engine and any Engine or Part
                        so removed shall be subject to separate insurance
                        coverage.

      (b)   Export Lessee's responsibility for certain cost

            The relevant Export Lessee shall:

            (i)   pay for and provide all electric power, oil, fuel and
                  lubricant consumed by and required for the operation of the
                  relevant Aircraft; and

            (ii)  promptly pay all navigation charges (including landing fees,
                  departure fees and airport taxes) the non-payment of which
                  could result in a Lien upon the Aircraft.

      (c)   Lawful insured operations

            The relevant Export Lessee will not cause or permit the relevant
            Aircraft, to be maintained, used or operated in violation of any
            law, treaty, statute, rule, regulation or order of any Governmental
            Entity having jurisdiction or contrary to the relevant
            Manufacturer's operating manuals and instructions, or, in the case
            of the relevant Aircraft and the Engines, in violation of any
            airworthiness certificate or registration relating thereto. The
            relevant Export Lessee agrees not to operate any the relevant
            Aircraft:

            (i)   unless such Aircraft is covered by insurance as required by
                  the Insurance Undertakings or

            (ii)  contrary to the terms of the insurance required by the
                  provisions of Insurance Undertakings.

      (d)   Notice of maintenance

            Regardless of the identity of the authorised maintenance performer

            thereof, of each upcoming major structural inspection (complete or
            partial), or other major check to be performed on the relevant
            Airframe and of any Engine overhaul.

      (e)   Maintenance

            The relevant Export Lessee, at its own cost and expense, or by
            application of any available Maintenance Reserves and/or Security
            Deposits, shall or shall procure that the authorised maintenance
            performer shall:

            (i)   service, repair, maintain, overhaul and test, or cause the
                  same to be done to, the relevant Aircraft (A) so as to keep

                  pursuant to the Airbus Purchase Agreement,

                                    Page 89

<PAGE>

                  ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in good operating
                  condition, and (B) so as to keep the relevant Aircraft in the
                  condition necessary to enable the airworthiness certification
                  of the relevant Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at
                  all times under all Applicable Laws and regulations of the
                  Aviation Authority and to obtain an airworthiness certificate
                  from the applicable regulatory authorities of at least one of
                  the United States, the JAA, Japan and Australia;

            (ii)  maintain or procure the maintenance of all records, logs and
                  other materials (including, without limitation, all Technical
                  Records) required by the Aviation Authority or the FAA in
                  respect of the Aircraft;

            (iii) prior to or promptly after the commencement of the next
                  succeeding Permitted Lease, incorporate into the relevant
                  Aircraft all mandatory Service Bulletins issued by the
                  Manufacturer or the relevant Engine Manufacturer and which are
                  required to be performed on or before the date of such
                  commencement;

            (iv)  carry out, on the relevant Aircraft, each applicable
                  Airworthiness Directive which the Aviation Authority may from
                  time to time issue on or by the date upon which the same is
                  required to be carried out;

            (v)   maintain all records and documents required by the Aviation
                  Authority or the Maintenance Program;

                  and the related Engines to comply with all warranty
                  requirements pursuant to the Airbus Purchase Agreement or, as
                  the case may be, any Warranties in relation to the relevant
                  Engine provided by the Engine Manufacturer;

            (vii) equip each relevant Airframe at all times with two Engines
                  (except as may be required for maintenance); and

            (viii) cause all maintenance and repairs to the relevant Aircraft to
                  be done by an authorised maintenance performer.

      (f)   Insignia and notices

            The relevant Export Lessee will affix and maintain at all times on
            and after the Delivery Date applicable to any relevant Aircraft in
            the cockpit of such Aircraft adjacent to and in and equally
            prominent position as the airworthiness certificate therein a
            nameplate bearing the inscription "This Aircraft is owned by [name
            of Borrower which is the owner] and [so long as such Aircraft is
            subject to the Mortgage] is subject to a mortgage in favour of
            Credit Lyonnais." or such other inscription as the Security Trustee
            from time to time may reasonably request in order to show the
            interests of the Finance Parties in such Aircraft or Engine, as the
            case may be. The relevant Export Lessee will not allow any person to
            place the name or other indication of any person to be placed on the
            relevant Airframe or any Engine as a designation that might be
            interpreted as a claim of ownership except that the relevant Export
            Lessee may permit any Permitted Lessee or prospective Permitted
            Lessee pursuant to a Permitted Lease to place its customary colours
            and insignia on the relevant Airframe and any relevant Engine in
            contemplation of the commencement of the leasing pursuant to such
            Permitted Lease.

      (g)   Use of Aircraft

            (i)   The relevant Export Lessee shall use, or permit the use of,
                  the relevant Aircraft solely in commercial operations for
                  which the relevant operator is duly authorised and not use, or
                  permit the use of, the Aircraft for any purpose for which it
                  is not suitable. Nothing herein shall prohibit the relevant
                  Export Lessee reasonable use and demonstration of the Aircraft
                  in remarketing thereof. The relevant Export Lessee shall
                  comply with all regulations of the Aviation Authority.

            (ii)  The relevant Export Lessee shall not permit the relevant
                  Aircraft to be (A) flown to or within an Prohibited Country or
                  operated or used by or for any person which is a national of,
                  or established under, the laws of, or whose principal place of
                  business or principal place of aircraft operations is located
                  in, an Prohibited Country, (B) principally used in, or
                  operated or used by or for any person which is a national of,
                  or established under the laws of, or whose principal place of
                  business or principal place of aircraft operations is located
                  in, a Prohibited Country, (C) "primarily based" in one or more
                  Prohibited Countries and for the purposes of this provision,
                  "primarily based" shall mean that during any consecutive seven
                  (7) day period, the aggregate amount of time spent on the
                  ground by the Aircraft in one or more Prohibited Countries
                  shall exceed fifteen per cent. (15%) of the total amount of
                  time spent on the ground during such seven (7) day period,
                  provided that the limitation imposed by this paragraph (C)
                  shall not prohibit, to the extent necessary, any non-recurring
                  emergency maintenance or other non-recurring emergency repairs
                  to be done with respect to the relevant Aircraft in a
                  Prohibited Country, (D) operated or used at any time for any
                  illegal purpose or in an illegal manner, or (E) operated or
                  located in an area excluded from coverage by required
                  insurance.

PART 3 REPLACEMENT OF PARTS, ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS
UNDERTAKINGS

      UNDERTAKINGS" means the following:

      (a)   Replacement of Parts:

            The relevant Export Lessee, at its own cost and expense or by
            application of any available Maintenance Reserves and/or Security
            Deposits, shall promptly replace all relevant Parts which may from
            time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
            confiscated, damaged beyond repair, time-expired or permanently
            rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, in
            the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or
            testing, the relevant Export Lessee may remove any relevant Part,
            whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
            confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for
            use; provided that the relevant Export Lessee shall at its own cost

            replacement Parts shall be free and clear of all Liens (other than
            Permitted Liens) and shall be in as good operating condition as, and
            shall have a value and utility and modification status at least
            equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were in
            the condition and repair and of the value and utility required to be
            maintained by the terms of the relevant Transaction Documents.

                                    Page 91

      (b)   Title to replaced and replacement Parts:

            (i)   All Parts removed from the relevant Airframe or an Engine
                  shall remain the property of the relevant Borrower which is
                  the owner of such Airframe or Engine and subject to the
                  Mortgage (if any), no matter where located, until such time as
                  such Parts shall be replaced by Parts to which title shall
                  have vested in the relevant Borrower which is the owner of
                  such Airframe or Engine and subject to the Mortgage (if any)
                  and which have been incorporated or installed in or attached
                  to the relevant Airframe or such Engine and which meet the
                  requirements for replacement Parts specified in (a) above.

            (ii)  Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated,
                  installed or attached as provided above, without further act,
                  (A) title to the replaced Part shall thereupon vest in the
                  Borrower which is the owner of such Airframe or Engine, free
                  and clear of the Mortgage (if any) and (B) subject to (c)
                  below, such replaced Part shall no longer be deemed a Part
                  hereunder; (C) title to the replacement Part shall on
                  replacement vest in the relevant Borrower; and (D) such
                  replacement Part shall be deemed to be a Part to the same
                  extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or
                  attached to the relevant Airframe or such Engine.

            (iii) Any Part removed from the relevant Airframe or any Engine may
                  be subject to a normal pooling agreement or arrangement
                  customary in the airline industry; provided that a Part which
                  meets the requirements for replacement Parts specified in (a)
                  above shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to
                  such Airframe or Engine in accordance with (b)(i) and (b)(ii)
                  above as promptly as possible after the removal of such
                  removed Part.

      (c)   Any replacement part when incorporated or installed in or attached
            to the relevant Airframe or an Engine from time to time may be owned
            by an air carrier other than a Lessee, subject to a normal pooling
            arrangement; provided that the relevant Borrower which is the owner
            of such Airframe or Engine, at its expense, as promptly thereafter
            as possible either (A) acquires title to such replacement part free
            and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), or (B) replaces
            such replacement part by incorporating or installing in or attaching
            to the relevant Airframe or an Engine a further replacement part
            owned by such relevant Borrower free and clear of all Liens (other
            than Permitted Liens) such replacement part in either case thereupon
            becoming a Part.

PART 4 INSURANCE UNDERTAKINGS

       "INSURANCE UNDERTAKINGS" means the following:

      (A)   PUBLIC LIABILITY, BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY
            INSURANCE

            The relevant Export Lessee, at its own expense, shall maintain or
            cause to be maintained in effect to the fullest extent available in
            the leading international insurance markets Aircraft Third Party
            (Bodily Injury and Property Damage), Passenger, Baggage, Cargo and
            Mail and Airline General Third Party (including Products) Legal
            Liability for a Combined Single Limit (Bodily Injury/Property
            Damage) and War and Allied Risks of an amount not less than six
            hundred million Dollars ($600,000,000) any one occurrence (but in
            respect of products liability this limit may be an aggregate limit
            for any and all losses occurring during the currency of the policy
            and in the case of baggage will extend to Lessee's liability solely
            in instances of loss or damage to the Aircraft).

                                    Page 92
<PAGE>

            All such policies shall be maintained in effect directly with
            independent insurers (for the avoidance of doubt not being a
            Government Entity) of recognised reputation and financial
            responsibility satisfactory to the Security Trustee. Any policies of
            insurance carried in accordance with these undertakings and any
            policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any of such
            policies shall:

            (i)   name the relevant Borrower, the relevant Export Lessee, each
                  of the Finance Parties and all other additional insureds, as
                  additional insureds (ADDITIONAL INSUREDS);

            (ii)  provide that, in relation to the interests of each of the
                  Additional Insureds, the Insurances will not be invalidated by
                  any act or omission (including misrepresentation and
                  non-disclosure) of any other person or party which results in
                  a breach of any term, condition or warranty of the policy,
                  provided that the additional insured party so protected has
                  not caused, contributed to or knowingly condoned the said act
                  or omission;

            (iii) provide that if the insurers cancel such insurance for any
                  reason whatever, or the same is allowed to lapse for
                  non-payment of premium, or if there is any material change in
                  policy terms and conditions, such cancellation, lapse or
                  change shall not be effective until 30 days (and with respect
                  to war risk insurance, such shorter period as shall be
                  customary in the international aviation market for such
                  insurance in such area of the world) after prior written
                  notice to the Security Trustee from such insurers or brokers
                  of such cancellation, lapse or change;

            (iv)  be primary without right of contribution from any other
                  insurance which may be available to any Additional Insured;

            (v)   expressly provide that all of the provisions thereof, except
                  the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as
                  if there were a separate policy covering each insured, but
                  this provision shall not operate to include any claim arising
                  in respect of loss or damage to the Aircraft or Engines
                  insured under the hull insurance provided below, and provided
                  further that the foregoing shall not increase the total
                  liability of the insurers beyond the limits of liability
                  stated in the policy;

            (vi)  provide for world wide coverage in full force and effect
                  throughout any geographical areas traversed by the Aircraft or
                  Engines; and

            (vii) provide, to the fullest extent customarily available in the
                  international aviation insurance markets, in respect of the
                  Aircraft at all times cover in respect of risks associated
                  with failure of any Computer System to be Year 2000 Compliant
                  (so that if at any time "Clause AVN2000 Date Recognition
                  Clause" or any equivalent clause is endorsed on the relevant
                  policies, "Clause AVN2001 Date Recognition Limited Coverage
                  Clause" and "Clause AVN2002 Date Recognition Limited Coverage
                  Clause" or equivalent clauses are similarly endorsed on such
                  policies), where;

                  (aa)  "Computer System" means any computer hardware and
                        software or any equipment operated by electronic means;
                        and

                  (bb)  "Year 2000 Compliant" means, in relation to any Computer
                        System, that any references to or use of a date before,
                        on or after

                        System will not have an adverse effect on the use of
                        that Computer System.

                  Without increasing the scope of coverage under the airline
                  liability policies, the insurers thereunder shall acknowledge
                  the existence of the Mortgages and the relevant Borrower
                  Security Assignment and Lease Security Assignments and, if
                  available at no additional cost to the relevant Export Lessee,
                  provide coverage for the indemnification provisions of this
                  Agreement. The insurers shall also, where appropriate and
                  available, acknowledge that the Finance Parties have no
                  operational control over the Aircraft.

      (B)   INSURANCE AGAINST LOSS OR DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT

            The relevant Export Lessee, at its own or any Lessee's expense,
            shall maintain or cause to be maintained directly in effect with
            independent insurers (for the avoidance of doubt not being a
            Government Entity) of recognised reputation and financial
            responsibility satisfactory to the Security Trustee:

            (i)   all-risk ground and flight aircraft hull insurance covering
                  each Aircraft;

            (ii)  all-risk spares coverage with respect to Engines or Parts
                  while removed from each Aircraft; and

            (iii) war risk, hijacking (air piracy), confiscation,
                  nationalisation, expropriation and related perils coverages
                  covering each Aircraft and its spares.

            All such insurance shall be in full force and effect throughout any
            geographical areas traversed at any time by the relevant Aircraft or
            Engines, shall be payable in Dollars or Euro (or such other currency
            as approved by the Agent) and shall be in an amount of not less than
            the Required Insurance Value as to the relevant Aircraft and be the
            subject of an Assignment of Insurances in form and substance
            reasonably acceptable to the Security Trustee. Any hull insurance
            carried in accordance with this paragraph shall not contain a
            provision for deductible self-insurance amount in excess of one
            million Dollars ($1,000,000). Each Engine, after removal from the
            Aircraft of which it forms part and while not installed on any other
            Airframe shall be insured for not less than six million Dollars
            ($6,000,000) under the policy referenced in (ii) above. Any policies
            carried in accordance with this undertaking shall:

            (aa)  provide that if such insurance is cancelled or materially
                  changed for any reason whatever, or the same is allowed to
                  lapse for non-payment of premium, such cancellation, change or
                  lapse shall not be effective for 30 days (and with respect to
                  war risk insurance, such shorter period as shall be customary
                  in the International Aviation market for such insurance in
                  such area of the world) after prior written notice to the
                  Security Trustee from such insurers of such cancellation or
                  lapse or material change in policy terms and conditions;

            (bb)  provide that, in relation to the interests of each of the
                  Additional Insureds, the Insurances will not be invalidated by
                  any act or omission (including misrepresentation and
                  non-disclosure) of any other person or party which results in
                  a breach of any term, condition or warranty of the policy,
                  provided that the additional insured party so protected has
                  not caused, contributed to or knowingly condoned the said act
                  or omission;

                                    Page 94

<PAGE>

            (cc)  include waivers by the insurers of any rights of subrogation
                  or set-off, counterclaim or other deduction whether by
                  attachment or otherwise, in respect of any liability of the
                  relevant Export Lessee except in respect of premiums in
                  respect of the relevant Aircraft which are the subject of the
                  relevant Permitted Lease;

            (dd)  where appropriate and available, be primary without right of
                  contribution from any other insurance which may be available
                  to any Additional Insured;

            (ee)  provide that in the event of a dispute between the
                  underwriters subscribing to the Hull Risks Policy and the
                  insurance underwriters subscribing to the Hull War and Allied
                  Risks Policy each policy shall subscribe to 50% of the agreed
                  valid claim in accordance with "50/50" clause AVS 103.

            (ff)  without increasing the scope of coverage under the airline
                  liability policies, the insurers thereunder shall acknowledge
                  the existence of the Mortgage and the relevant Borrower
                  Security Assignment, the Lease Security Assignments and the
                  relevant Assignment of Insurances. The insurers shall also,
                  where appropriate and available, acknowledge that none of the
                  Finance Parties has any operational control over the relevant
                  Aircraft.

      (C)   CONTRACT PARTIES AND DOCUMENTS

            If and for as long as the same shall be customary or available in
            the international aviation insurance markets, the relevant Export
            Lessee shall ensure that for the purposes of Lloyds Endorsement AVN
            67B in relation to all policies of Insurance for an Aircraft:

            (i)   this Agreement and the Transaction Documents relevant to that
                  Aircraft are identified as Contracts; and

            (ii)  the Additional Insureds are named as the Contract Parties.

      (D)   APPLICATION OF TOTAL LOSS PROCEEDS

            The proceeds of any policy of Insurance shall be applied in
            accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

      (E)   LOSS PAYEE

            The Security Trustee shall be the sole loss payee in relation to
            Total Loss Proceeds. If a Relevant Event has occurred and is
            continuing under any of the Transaction Documents, any claim,
            settlement (net of any policy deductible) shall be made to the order
            of the Security Trustee in its capacity as sole loss payee entitled
            to receive such funds or to its order.

      (F)   REPORTS, ETC.

            The relevant Export Lessee and the relevant Export Lessee's
            independent insurance broker shall advise the Security Trustee in
            writing promptly of any default in the payment of any premium and of
            any other act or omission on the part of the relevant Export Lessee
            which might invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in part,
            any insurance on any Aircraft. On the renewal date of any insurance
            policy maintained with respect to any Aircraft pursuant to this
            undertaking, the relevant Export Lessee shall provide the Security
            Trustee with the insurance certificates executed by an independent
            aircraft insurance broker together with their letter of undertaking.

                                    Page 95

      (G)   ADDITIONAL INSURANCE

            No additional insurance procured by the relevant Export Lessee shall
            have the effect of suspending, impairing, defeating, invalidating or
            rendering unenforceable or reducing, in whole or in part, the
            coverage of or the proceeds payable under any insurance required to
            be provided and maintained by the relevant Export Lessee pursuant to
            this undertaking.

      (H)   ADDITIONAL INSUREDS NOT LIABLE FOR PREMIUMS

            All policies of insurance carried hereunder shall clearly state that
            none of the Finance Parties nor any other Additional Insureds nor
            any assignee of such party, shall have any liability for or
            obligation with respect to premiums, commissions, assessments or
            calls, but shall have the right to pay the same with respect to any
            Aircraft and/or Engines.

      (I)   CONTINUING INSURANCE

            The Security Trustee and/or the Agent may require the relevant
            Export Lessee to effect and to maintain (or procure) insurance after
            the end of the Lease Period in relation to any Aircraft with respect
            to its liability under the indemnities under Clause 13.1 of this
            Agreement for such period as the Security Trustee or the Agent, as
            the case may be, may require (but in any event not after the second
            anniversary of the end of such Lease Period). The relevant Export
            Lessee's obligation under this paragraph (i) shall not be affected
            by the relevant Export Lessee ceasing and/or any of the Indemnitees
            ceasing to have any interest in the relevant Aircraft.

      (J)   FAILURE TO INSURE

            If the relevant Export Lessee fails to insure or procure insurance
            for any Aircraft in accordance with this undertaking, the Security
            Trustee may (but is not obliged to):

            (i)   pay outstanding premiums or effect alternative insurance in
                  respect of such Aircraft to rectify the relevant Export
                  Lessee's failure and any cost incurred by the Security Trustee
                  in the exercise of this right shall be reimbursed by the
                  relevant Export Lessee on demand together with interest
                  thereon equal to the Default Rate, and

            (ii)  require such Aircraft to be grounded at an airport of its
                  choice and to remain there until it is once again insured in
                  accordance with this undertaking.

      (K)   CHANGE IN INDUSTRY PRACTICE

      (a)   If there is a material change in the generally accepted
            industry-wide practice with regard to the insurance of aircraft or
            any material change with respect to the insurance of aircraft based
            or operated in any jurisdiction in which the Aircraft may then be
            based or operated (whether relating to all or any of the types of
            Insurances required to be effected hereby) such that GFC or the
            Security Trustee, having regard to the advice of its insurance
            adviser, shall be of the reasonable opinion that the Insurances
            required to be effected hereby are insufficient to protect the
            respective interests of the Lessee in the Additional Assureds
            (bearing in mind the nature and route of operation of the Aircraft),
            these insurance requirements shall, following consultation with the
            Lessee, be amended, as soon as practicable following notice by GFC
            or the Security Trustee to the Lessee, so as to include such
            additional or varied requirements as may be reasonably necessary to
            ensure that the insurance as so varied shall provide

                                    Page 96
<PAGE>

            comparable protection to the Lessee in the Additional Assureds to
            that which it would have done if such change had not occurred.

      (b)   If, at any time, the Insurances required under Part 4 of Schedule 6
            paragraph A in relation to War and Allied Risks cease, or will
            cease, to be available in the worldwide aviation insurance market on
            a per occurrence basis, then (without in any way limiting, reducing
            or otherwise qualifying any of the Lessee's obligations under the
            Lease Agreement in relation to such Insurances and/or the rights of
            the lessor in relation thereto under the Lease Agreement) if there
            occurs any event that gives rise to a claim under such Insurances in
            relation to the Aircraft or any other aircraft operated by the
            Lessee, the Lessee shall either (a) immediately cause to be
            reinstated the coverage in relation to such Insurances that was in
            place immediately prior to the occurrence of such event or (b)
            immediately ground the Aircraft and ensure that the Aircraft is
            covered by such ground risk coverage as is customary in accordance
            with normal industry practice in an amount at least equal to that
            required under Part 4 of Schedule 6 paragraph A.

      (c)   If, at any time, any of the Insurances required to be effected
            hereby cease, or will cease, to be available on reasonable
            commercial terms in the worldwide aviation insurance market, GFC,
            the Security Trustee and the Lessee agree (without in any way
            limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying any of the Lessee's
            obligations under the Lease Agreement in relation to such Insurances
            and/or the rights of the lessor in relation thereto under the Lease
            Agreement) to hold good faith discussions at such time for a period
            of up to seven (7) days to ascertain what alternatives (if any) to
            such Insurances exist. GFC and the Security Trustee shall not be
            under any obligation to take any action, grant consents or waivers
            or take other steps if to do so (a) would or would be likely to
            involve it in any unlawful activity or would involve it in any loss,
            cost, liability or expense or Tax disadvantage unless indemnified by
            the Lessee to their satisfaction or (b) would be reasonably likely
            to adversely affect the rights and interests of any of the Finance
            Parties under the Transaction Documents.

      (L)   REINSURANCES

            Where reinsurances are required to be placed according to the terms
            of this Agreement such reinsurances shall (a) be on the same terms
            as the original insurances and will include the provisions of this
            Schedule, (b) provide that notwithstanding any bankruptcy,
            insolvency, liquidation or similar proceedings or affecting the
            reinsured that the reinsurers' liability will be to make such
            payments as would have fallen due under the relevant policy of
            reinsurance if the reinsured had (immediately before such
            bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or similar
            proceedings) discharged its obligations in full under the original
            insurance policies in respect of which the then relevant policy of
            reinsurance has been effected; and (c) be at such levels as are
            standard market practice for the jurisdiction of the primary insurer
            and consistent with levels applied by GFC with respect to its other
            aircraft operated in such jurisdiction or such other levels proposed
            by GFC and agreed to by the Security Trustee; and (d) contain a
            "cut-through" clause in the following form (or otherwise,
            satisfactory to the relevant Export Lessee and reasonably
            satisfactory to the Security Trustee): "The Reinsurers and the
            Reinsured hereby mutually agree that in the event of any claim
            arising under the reinsurances in respect of a total loss where such
            claim is to be paid to the person named as loss payee under the
            primary insurances, the Reinsurers will in lieu of payment to the
            Reinsured, its successors in interest and assigns pay to the person
            named as loss payee under the primary insurances effected by the
            Reinsured, that portion of any loss due for which the Reinsurers
            would otherwise be liable to pay the original Reinsured (subject to
            proof of loss), it being understood and agreed that

                                    Page 97

<PAGE>

            any such payment by the Reinsurers will (to the extent of such
            payment) fully discharge and release the Reinsurers from any and all
            further liability in connection therewith subject to such provisions
            not contravening any law of the State of Incorporation.

      (M)   RENEWALS

            The relevant Export Lessee will monitor the insurances on the
            Aircraft and their expiration dates. Promptly after receipt, the
            relevant Export Lessee will provide to the Security Trustee evidence
            of renewal of the insurances and reinsurance (if any).

      (N)   INFORMATION

            The relevant Export Lessee shall provide the Security Trustee or
            shall ensure that the Security Trustee is provided with any
            information reasonably requested by the Security Trustee from time
            to time concerning the insurances maintained with respect to the
            Aircraft or, if reasonably available to the relevant Export Lessee,
            in connection with any claim being made or proposed to be made
            thereunder.

      (O)   REPORTS AND BROKER'S UNDERTAKINGS

            On or before the Delivery Date in respect of each Aircraft, and
            thereafter on or prior to each renewal or replacement of the
            insurance required hereby, but not less often than annually, the
            relevant Export Lessee will obtain from the Lessee one or more
            original certificates (in the case of renewal or replacement
            confirmation shall be obtained prior to renewal/replacement with
            certification to be delivered as soon as practicable), each executed
            and delivered by an insurance broker appointed by Lessee and
            approved by the relevant Export Lessee, and a certified English
            translation thereof, which together shall describe in reasonable
            detail insurance carried on the Aircraft. The relevant Export Lessee
            will cause such approved insurance broker to agree to advise the
            Additional Insureds:

      (a)   promptly in writing of the receipt by them of any notice of
            cancellation or material change in the insurances;

      (b)   if any premiums are not paid to them in accordance with the
            accounting procedures that exist between the Lessee and themselves
            before they notify insurers of such non-payment of premiums;

      (c)   if requested, of the premium payment situation; and

      (d)   if they cease to be Insurance Brokers to the Lessee.

SCHEDULE 11 - APPOINTMENT OF SECURITY TRUSTEE, AGENT AND NATIONAL AGENTS AND
TRUST PROVISIONS

1.    APPOINTMENT AND POWERS OF THE SECURITY TRUSTEE

1.1   Each of the Finance Parties and the Export Lessees irrevocably appoints
      the Security Trustee as its trustee to hold the Collateral on its behalf
      on the terms set out in this Agreement and in the Aircraft Security
      Documents.

1.2   By virtue of the appointment set out above, each of the Finance Parties
      and the Export Lessees hereby authorises the Security Trustee (whether or
      not by or through its employees or agents) to take such action on its
      behalf and to exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to the
      Security Trustee by this Agreement together with such powers and rights as
      are reasonably incidental thereto,

1.3   The Security Trustee shall have no duties, obligations or liabilities to
      any of the parties by whom it has been appointed beyond those expressly
      stated in this Agreement and specifically (but without prejudice to the
      generality of the foregoing) the Security Trustee shall not be obliged to
      take any action or exercise any rights, remedies or powers under or
      pursuant to this Agreement beyond those which it is specifically
      instructed in writing to take or exercise as provided in Paragraph 10 and
      then only to the extent stated in such specific written instructions.

2.    DECLARATION OF TRUST

2.1   The Security Trustee hereby accepts its appointment under Paragraph 1 as
      trustee in relation to the Collateral with effect from the date of this
      Agreement and irrevocably acknowledges and declares that from such date it
      holds the same on trust for the respective Finance Parties and the Export
      Lessees and that it shall apply, and deal with, such trust in accordance
      with the provisions of this Agreement.

2.2   The trusts constituted or evidenced by this Agreement shall remain in full
      force and effect until whichever is the earlier of the expiration of a
      period of eighty (80) years from the date of this Agreement, and receipt
      by the Security Trustee of written confirmation from the respective
      Finance Parties and the Export Lessees that all the obligations and
      liabilities for which the Aircraft Security Documents are constituted as
      security have been discharged in full. The parties to this Agreement
      declare that the perpetuity period applicable to this Agreement shall, for
      the purposes of the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 be a period of
      80 years from the date of this Agreement.

2.3   The Security Trustee may, in the conduct of any trusts constituted by this
      Agreement, instead of acting personally, employ and pay any agent (whether
      being a lawyer, chartered accountant or any other person) to transact or
      concur in transacting any business and to do or concur in doing any acts
      required to be done by the Security Trustee (including the receipt and
      payment of money). Any such agent engaged in any profession or business
      shall be entitled to be paid all usual professional and other charges for
      business transacted and acts done by him or any partner or employee of his
      in connection with such trusts. The Security Trustee shall not be bound to
      supervise, or be responsible for any loss incurred by reason of any act or
      omission of any such agent if the Security Trustee shall have exercised
      reasonable care in the selection of such agent.

2.4   In its capacity as trustee in relation to the Aircraft Security Documents,
      the Security Trustee shall, without prejudice to any of the powers and
      immunities conferred upon trustees by law (and to the extent not
      inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or any of the Aircraft

                                    Page 126

<PAGE>

      Security Documents), have all the same powers as a natural person acting
      as the beneficial owner of such property and/or as are conferred upon the
      Security Trustee by this Agreement and/or any of the Aircraft Security
      Documents.

2.5   In its capacity as trustee in relation to the Aircraft Security Documents,
      the Security Trustee shall have full power to determine all questions and
      doubts arising in relation to the interpretation or application of any of
      the provisions of this Agreement or any of the Aircraft Security Documents
      as it affects the Security Trustee and every such determination (whether
      made upon a question actually raised or implied in the acts or proceedings
      of the Security Trustee) shall be conclusive and shall bind all the other
      parties to this Agreement.

2.6   It is agreed between all parties to this Agreement that in relation to any
      jurisdiction the courts of which would not recognise or give effect to the
      trusts expressed to be constituted by this Agreement, the relationship of
      the Finance Parties and the Export Lessees to the Security Trustee shall
      in the case of each of the trusts constituted hereby be construed simply
      as one of principal and agent but, to the fullest extent permissible under
      the laws of each and every such jurisdiction, this Agreement shall have
      full force and effect as between the parties.

2.7   The Security Trustee shall be entitled (and bound) to assume that any
      directions received by it from the Agent (or, once the Secured Loan
      Obligations have been fully repaid and discharged, the Export Lessees)
      under or pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
      Documents are the directions of the Lenders (or the Export Credit
      Agencies) or the directions of the Agent itself (or, once the Secured Loan
      Obligations have been fully repaid and discharged, to the Export Lessees)
      acting pursuant to the provisions of the Transaction Documents. The
      Security Trustee shall not be liable to the Finance Parties, or any of
      them (or, once the Secured Loan Obligations have been fully repaid and
      discharged, to the Export Lessees) for any action taken or omitted under
      or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
      Documents in accordance with any such directions unless caused by the
      gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Security Trustee.

3.    RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON AND EXCLUSIONS OF THE DUTIES AND
      RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECURITY TRUSTEE

3.1   The Security Trustee shall not be obliged:

      3.1.1 to request any certificate or opinion under any Transaction Document
            unless so required in writing by the Agent, in which case, subject
            to the provisions of Paragraph 10, the Security Trustee shall
            promptly make the appropriate request of the relevant party; or

      3.1.2 to make any enquiry as to any default by any party in the
            performance or observance of any provision of any of the Aircraft
            Security Documents or as to whether any event or circumstance has
            occurred as a result of which the security constituted by any of the
            Aircraft Security Documents shall have or may become enforceable.

3.2   The Security Trustee shall not have any duty or responsibility, either
      initially or on a continuing basis:

      3.2.1 subject to Paragraph 3.7, to provide any of the other parties hereto
            with any information with respect to any Borrower, any Export Lessee
            or GFC whenever coming into its possession; or

      3.2.2 to investigate or make any enquiry into the title of any parry to
            the Collateral or any part thereof.

                                    Page 127

<PAGE>

3.3   The Security Trustee shall not have any responsibility to any of the
      Finance Parties or any Export Lessee (a) on account of the failure of any
      other party to perform any of its or their obligations under any of the
      Transaction Documents, (b) for the financial condition of any Borrower,
      any Export Lessee or GFC, (c) for the completeness or accuracy of any
      statements, representations or warranties in any of the Transaction
      Documents or any document delivered under any of the Transaction
      Documents, (d) for the execution, effectiveness, adequacy, genuineness,
      validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of any of the
      Transaction Documents or of any certificate, report or other document
      executed or delivered under any of the Transaction Documents, (e) to
      investigate or make any enquiry into the title of any party to the
      property which forms the Collateral or any part thereof, (f) for the
      failure to register any of the Transaction Documents on any register with
      any authority, court or relevant body, (g) for the failure to take or
      require any Borrower, any Export Lessee, GFC, the Manufacturer, the Engine
      Manufacturer, any sub-lessee or any provider of insurances or
      reinsurances, to take any steps to render any of the Collateral effective
      or to secure the creation of any ancillary charge under the laws of the
      jurisdiction concerned or (h) otherwise in connection with the Transaction
      Documents or their negotiation or for acting (or, as the case may be,
      refraining from acting) in accordance with the directions of the Agent or
      the National Agents or in reliance upon information provided by the Agent
      or the National Agents or any of the Lenders.

3.4   The Security Trustee shall be entitled to rely on any communication,
      instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
      have been signed or sent by the proper person and shall be entitled to
      rely as to legal or other professional matters on opinions and statements
      of any legal or other professional advisers selected or approved by it.

3.5   The Security Trustee shall be entitled to place all Aircraft Security
      Documents and any other Transaction Documents, certificates and other
      documents relating thereto or any of them in any safe deposit, safe or
      receptacle selected by the Security Trustee or with any solicitor or firm
      of solicitors and may make any such arrangements as it thinks fit for
      allowing each Finance Party access to, or its solicitors or auditors
      possession of, such documents when necessary or convenient, and the
      Security Trustee shall not be responsible for any loss incurred in
      connection with any such deposit, access or possession.

3.6   The Security Trustee may refrain from doing anything which would, or might
      in its reasonable opinion, be contrary to any law of any jurisdiction or
      any directive, regulation or regulatory requirement of any state (or any
      agency thereof) or which would or might render it liable to any person and
      may do anything which is, in its opinion, necessary to comply with any
      such law, directive, regulation or regulatory requirement.

3.7   The Security Trustee shall notify the Agent as soon as is reasonably
      practicable, of the contents of any communication received by it from any
      Borrower, any Export Lessee or GFC pursuant to any Transaction Document.

4.    NO RESTRICTION ON OR LIABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER TRANSACTIONS

4.1   The Security Trustee may, without any liability to account to any of the
      Finance Parties or any Export Lessee, accept deposits from, lend money to,
      and generally engage in any kind of trust or banking business with, or be
      the owner or holder of any shares or other securities of, any Borrower,
      any Export Lessee, GFC or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
      associated companies or any of the Finance Parties as if it were not the
      Security Trustee.

4.2   With respect to its own participation in the Transaction Documents, the
      Security Trustee shall have the rights and powers thereunder and under the
      Aircraft Security Documents of a Lender and may exercise the same as
      though it were not performing the duties and functions delegated to it
      under this Agreement.

5.    COMMON AGENT AND SECURITY TRUSTEE

      Notwithstanding that the Agent, the Security Trustee and the French
      National Agent may from time to time be the same legal entities, the
      Agent, the Security Trustee and the French National Agent have each
      entered into this Agreement in their separate capacities as agent for the
      relevant Lenders, and as trustee for the Finance Parties under and
      pursuant to the Transaction Documents; PROVIDED ALWAYS that, where this
      Agreement provides for the Agent, the Security Trustee or the French
      National Agent to communicate with or provide instructions to any of the
      Agent, the Security Trustee or the French National Agent while the Agent,
      the Security Trustee or the French National Agent are the same or related
      entities, it will not be necessary for there to be any such formal
      communication or instructions notwithstanding that this Agreement provides
      in certain cases for the same to be in writing.

6.    CHANGE OF SECURITY TRUSTEE

      6.1   The Security Trustee may retire from its appointment as Security
            Trustee of the Trusts under this Agreement without giving any reason
            and without being responsible for any costs occasioned by such
            retirement having given to the Finance Parties and GFC not less than
            sixty (60) days written notice of its intention to do so Provided
            always that no such retirement shall take effect unless there has
            been appointed as a successor security agent and trustee in respect
            of the Trust by instrument in writing signed by the Security
            Trustee:

    6.1.1   a trust corporation, bank or financial institution nominated by the
            Agent and, provided no Relevant Event or Termination Event shall
            have occurred and be continuing, approved by GFC (such approval not
            to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), or at any time after the
            Advance and all amounts owing in respect thereof have been repaid or
            prepaid in full; or

    6.1.2   failing such a nomination, any trust corporation, bank or financial
            institution with offices in London nominated by the Security Trustee
            after consultation with the Finance Parties and with the consent of
            the Agent, or at any time after the Advance and all amounts owing in
            respect thereof have been repaid or,

      and, in either case, such successor security trustee shall have duly
      accepted such appointment by delivering to the Agent and the other Finance
      Parties written confirmation (in a form acceptable to the Agent) of such
      acceptance agreeing to be bound by this Agreement in the capacity of
      Security Trustee as if it had been an original party to this Agreement and
      the other Aircraft Security Documents.

6.2   Upon any successor to the Security Trustee being appointed pursuant to
      Paragraph 6.1, the retiring Security Trustee shall be discharged from any
      further obligation under this Agreement and the other Aircraft Security
      Documents with respect to the Collateral and its successor and each of the
      other parties to this Agreement and the other Aircraft Security Documents
      shall have the same rights and obligations among themselves as they would
      have had if such successor had been a party to this Agreement and the
      other Aircraft Security Documents in place of the retiring Security
      Trustee.

6.3   Notwithstanding paragraph 6.1, the Security Trustee shall be entitled to
      retire from its appointment as Security Trustee hereunder upon five (5)
      days written notice to GFC at any time when the Secured Loan Obligations
      have been fully repaid and discharged. GFC shall, at its own cost, at such
      time assume the role of Security Trustee hereunder.

7.    NATIONAL AGENTS

7.1   Each of the British Lenders, the French Lenders and the German Lenders
      irrevocably appoints respectively the British National Agent, the French
      National Agent and the German National Agent as its agent for the purposes
      of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and authorises such
      National Agent (whether or not by or through employees or agents) to take
      such action on the relevant Lender's behalf and to exercise such rights,
      remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to such
      National Agent by this Agreement, together with such power's and
      discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto. The British National
      Agent, the French National Agent and the German National Agent shall not,
      however, have any duties, obligations or liabilities to their respective
      Lenders beyond those expressly stated in this Agreement and the other
      Transaction Documents.

7.2   Each National Agent may retire from its appointment as agent for the
      relevant Lenders having given to the Agent, GFC and each of the relevant
      Lenders not less than thirty (30) days written notice of its intention to
      do so; PROVIDED ALWAYS that no such retirement by a National Agent shall
      take effect unless there has been appointed by the relevant Lenders as a
      successor agent either:

      7.2.1 a Lender nominated by the relevant Lenders or, failing such a
            nomination,

      7.2.2 any reputable and experienced bank or financial institution
            nominated by the retiring National Agent.

7.3   No National Agent shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
      omitted under or in connection with this Agreement or any of the
      Transaction Documents or any of the Advances except in the case of the
      gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such National Agent.

      For the purposes of this Paragraph 7 no National Agent shall be treated as
      having actual knowledge of any matter of which any department or any
      division other than that specified in a notice served in accordance with
      Clause 22 of this Agreement hereof may become aware in the context of
      corporate finance or advisory activities from time to time undertaken by
      such National Agent for the Borrower, the Lessee or any of their
      respective associates.

7.4   Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, opinion,
      forecast or other representation made by any National Agent to induce it
      to enter into any of the Transaction Documents and that it has made and
      will continue to make, without reliance on any National Agent and based on
      such documents as it considers appropriate, its own appraisal of the
      creditworthiness of any Borrower, any Export Lessee or GFC and its own
      independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the
      Borrowers, the Export Lessees and GFC in connection with the making and
      continuation of any of the Advances. No National Agent shall have any duty
      or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide
      the Lenders with any credit or other information with respect to the
      Borrower or the Lessee whether coming into its possession before the
      making of the relevant advance or at any time or times thereafter. No
      National Agent shall have any duty or responsibility for the completeness
      or accuracy of any information given by the Borrower or the Lessee in
      connection with or pursuant to any of the Transaction Documents, whether
      the same is given to such National Agent and passed on by it to any
      Lenders or otherwise.

7.5   Upon any such successor as aforesaid being appointed, the retiring
      National Agent, in accordance with this Agreement shall be discharged from
      any further obligation under this Agreement and its successor and each of
      the other parties to this Agreement shall have the same rights and
      obligations among themselves as they would have had if such successor had
      been a party to this Agreement in place of the retiring National Agent.

8.    AGENT

8.1   Each Lender and each National Agent irrevocably appoints the Agent as its
      agent for the purposes of this Agreement, the Advances and the Transaction
      Documents and authorises the Agent (whether or not by or through employees
      or agents) to take such action on their behalf and to exercise such
      rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to
      the Agent by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, together
      with such powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
      Agent shall not, however, have any duties, obligations or liabilities to
      the Lenders or the National Agents beyond those expressly stated in this
      Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

9.1   The Agent may assume that each relevant Lender's Lending Office is that
      specified in Schedule 1 or (as the case may be) in the Transfer
      Certificate (as defined in the Loan Supplements) whereby such Lender
      became a party hereto until it has received from such Lender a notice
      designating some other office of such Lender as its Lending Office and act
      upon any such notice until the same is superseded by a further such
      notice.

9.2   All moneys to be paid or distributed by the Agent or the Security Trustee
      to the Lenders under this Agreement or any Transaction Document may be
      effected by the payment to the relevant National Agent for the account of
      the Lenders for whom it acts as agent of its portion of the amount so to
      be paid or distributed. Each payment so received by any National Agent
      shall be distributed between the relevant Lenders in accordance with their
      respective participations.

9.3   Except with the prior written consent of each of the relevant Lenders for
      whom the a Agent acts in such capacity and subject as otherwise provided
      in this Agreement, no Agent shall

                                    Page 131

<PAGE>

      have authority on behalf of the Lenders for whom it acts as agent to agree
      with the Borrower any amendment (other than an amendment described in
      Paragraph 9.4 below) to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
      which would:

      9.3.1 reduce the Applicable Rate or the amount of any payment to be made
            for account of any of the relevant Lenders under this Agreement or
            the other Transaction Documents;

      9.3.2 alter the due date, reduce the amount or alter the currency of any
            payment of principal, interest or other amount payable for the
            account of the relevant Lenders under this Agreement or any other
            Transaction Document;

      9.3.3 alter any relevant Lender's Commitment from time to time or subject
            any relevant Lender to any obligations not expressly contemplated by
            this Agreement or any Transaction Document;

            Security Documents or the Liens constituted thereby or consent to
            any of the same save in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
            and the other Transaction Documents; or

      9.3.7 amend, modify or vary this Paragraph 9.3;

9.4   The Agent or the Security Trustee may, without the prior written approval
      of the Majority Lenders, amend any provision of this Agreement or any
      other Transaction Document if such amendment is necessary to correct any
      manifest error herein or therein, and any such amendment shall be binding
      on all the parties.

9.5   Except with the prior written consent of the Agent or the Security
      Trustee, as the case may be, the Lenders shall not have authority to
      amend, modify or vary any provision of this Agreement which regulates the
      remuneration, rights, duties and/or powers of the Agent or the Security
      Trustee, as the case may be.

9.6   With respect to its own Relevant Proportion (if any) in any Advance, the
      Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the
      Transaction Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
      though it were not performing the duties and functions delegated to it (as
      agent) under this Agreement or, as the case may be, the Transaction
      Documents, and the term "LENDER" shall, unless the context otherwise
      indicates, include the Agent. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
      Transaction Documents shall (nor shall the same be construed so as to)
      constitute a partnership between the parties or any of them or so as to
      establish a fiduciary relationship between the Agent (in any capacity) and
      any other person.

9.7   The Agent shall not:

      9.7.1 be obliged to make any enquiry as to any default by any Borrower,
            any Export Lessee or GFC in the performance or observance of any of
            the provisions of any of the Transaction Documents or as to the
            existence of a default unless the Agent has actual knowledge thereof
            or has been notified in writing thereof, in which case the Agent
            shall promptly notify the Lenders for which it acts as agent of the
            relevant event or circumstances;

                                    Page 132

            connection with this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents
            or any of the Advances except in the case of the gross negligence or
            wilful misconduct of the Agent.

      For the purposes of this Paragraph 9 no Agent shall be treated as having
      actual knowledge of any matter of which any department or any division
      other than that specified in Clause 22 (NOTICES) of this Agreement may
      become aware in the context of corporate finance or advisory activities
      from time to time undertaken by the Agent for any Borrower, any Export
      Lessee, GFC or any of their respective associates.

9.8   Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, opinion,
      forecast or other representation made by the Agent to induce it to enter
      into any of the Transaction Documents and that it has made and will
      continue to make, without reliance on the Agent and based on such
      documents as it considers appropriate, its own appraisal of the
      creditworthiness of the Borrowers, the Export Lessees and GFC and its own
      independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the
      Borrower, the Export Lessees and GFC in connection with the making and
      continuation of any of the Advances. The Agent shall not have any duty or
      responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide the
      Lenders with any credit or other information with respect to any Borrower,
      any Export Lessee or GFC whether coming into its possession before the
      making of the relevant advance or at any time or times thereafter, other
      than as provided in sub-Paragraph 9.7.1. the Agent shall not have any duty
      or responsibility for the completeness or accuracy of any information
      given by the Borrower or the Lessee in connection with or pursuant to any
      of the Transaction Documents, whether the same is given to the Agent and
      passed on by it to any Lenders or otherwise.

9.9   The Agent shall not have any responsibility to any Lender:

      9.9.1 on account of the failure of any Borrower, any Export Lessee or GFC
            to perform their obligations under any of the Transaction Documents;
            or

      9.9.2 for the financial condition of any Borrower, any Export Lessee or
            GFC; or

      9.9.3 for the completeness or accuracy of any statements, representations
            or warranties in any of the Transaction Documents or any document
            delivered under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
            Documents; or

      9.9.4 for the execution, effectiveness, adequacy, genuineness, validity,
            enforceability or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement or any
            of the other Transaction Documents or of any certificate, report or
            other document executed or delivered under this Agreement or any of
            the other Transaction Documents; or

      9.9.5 otherwise in connection with any of the Advances or the negotiation
            of any Transaction Document; or

      9.9.6 for acting (or, as the case may be, refraining from acting) in
            accordance with the instructions of the Majority Lenders and/or in
            accordance with any provision of any Transaction Document.

      The Agent shall be entitled to rely on any communication, instrument or
      document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed
      or sent by the proper person and shall be entitled to rely as to legal or
      other professional matters on opinions and statements of any legal or
      other professional advisers selected or approved by it.

      The Agent may, without any liability to account to any Lender, accept
      deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking
      or trust business with any Borrower,

                                    Page 133

      associates or any of the other Finance Parties as if it were not an agent
      hereunder.

10.   ENFORCEMENT OF AND OTHER ACTION UNDER THE AIRCRAFT SECURITY DOCUMENTS

10.1  NO ENFORCEMENT BY FINANCE PARTIES

      None of the Finance Parties or any Export Lessee shall have any
      independent power to enforce any of the Aircraft Security Documents, to
      exercise any rights and/or powers or to grant any consents or releases
      under or pursuant to any of the Aircraft Security Documents or otherwise
      have direct recourse to the security constituted by any of the Aircraft
      Security Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
      hereof or of any other Transaction Document it is hereby acknowledged and
      agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to send an Acceleration Notice or
      a Loan Acceleration Notice under Clause 10.2 of this Agreement.

10.2  ACCELERATION OF LOANS

      Save as expressly provided in this Paragraph 10, none of the Finance
      Parties shall have any independent power to take any steps to accelerate
      or demand repayment of any Advance, to exercise any rights or powers or to
      grant any consents or releases relating to or in connection with the
      occurrence or existence of a Termination Event. Notwithstanding any other
      provisions of this Paragraph 10 it is expressly agreed and acknowledged
      that at any time the Agent shall if so instructed by any of the National
      Agents (acting on the instructions of its Export Credit Agency):

      (a)   take the action set out in Paragraph 10.1; or

      (b)   following the occurrence of a Termination Event, accelerate the
            relevant Advance or Advances.

10.3  ACTION UNDER AIRCRAFT SECURITY DOCUMENTS

      If a Termination Event shall occur and be continuing at any time before
      the Secured Loan Obligations have been fully repaid and discharged, then
      subject to the Security Trustee being indemnified to its satisfaction, the
      Security Trustee shall ensure that the appropriate person takes such
      action (including, without limitation, the exercise of all rights and/or
      powers and the granting of consents or releases) or, as the case may be,
      refrains from taking such action under or pursuant to the Aircraft
      Security Documents as the Agent shall specifically direct the Security
      Trustee. If any Borrower is in breach of any obligation to any Export
      Lessee under any Credit Sale Agreement at any time after the Secured Loan
      Obligations have been fully repaid and discharged, then subject to the
      Security Trustee being indemnified to its satisfaction the Security
      Trustee shall ensure that the appropriate person takes such action
      (including, without limitation, the exercise of all rights and/or powers
      and the granting of consents or releases) or, as the case may be, refrains
      from taking such action under or pursuant to the Aircraft Security
      Documents. Unless and until the Security Trustee shall have received such
      directions or instructions, the Security Trustee shall not be required to
      ensure that any action is taken under any of the Aircraft Security
      Documents.

10.4  ACTION FOLLOWING TERMINATION EVENT

      If at any time before the Secured Loan Obligations have been fully repaid
      and discharged, any party hereto becomes aware that a Termination Event
      has occurred and is continuing, such party shall as soon as practicable
      after becoming aware thereof give written notice to the

                                    Page 134

<PAGE>

      Borrower, the Agent and the Security Trustee who shall thereupon give
      notice (a "NOTICE OF EVENT") of the same to the National Agents;

      (A)   within a period of thirty (30) days following the giving of the
            Notice of Event by the Security Trustee or the expiry of any period
            specified in any Notice of Event issued by the Security Trustee or
            any period specified in any Notice of Reservation of Rights issued
            by the Security Trustee in accordance with Paragraph 10.5, the
            National Agents shall not have given either:

            (a)   notice (a "NOTICE FOR INACTION") to the Agent requiring such
                  action not to be taken; or

            (b)   notice to the Agent and the Security Trustee requesting the
                  issue of a Notice of Reservation of Rights, or a further
                  Notice of Reservation of Rights, pursuant to Paragraph 10.5;
                  or

      (B)   any National Agent gives notice (a "NOTICE FOR ACTION") in writing
            to the Agent requiring such action to be taken,

      then, upon expiry of the relevant period referred to in Paragraph 10.4(A)
      or upon the giving of a Notice of Action by the Agent (or, if one or more
      Notices of Reservation of Rights have been delivered by the Security
      Trustee in accordance with Paragraph 10.5, upon the expiry of the period
      referred to in the last Notice of Reservation of Rights), to the extent
      permitted by the Transaction Documents and applicable law (and provided
      always that, at the relevant time, such Event of Default is continuing):

      (C)   the Agent shall give an Acceleration Notice or, as directed a Loan
            Acceleration Notice declaring the Advance(s) immediately due and
            payable and such Advance(s) shall become due and payable pursuant
            to, and in accordance with, the terms of this Agreement; and

      (D)   the Security Trustee shall ensure that such steps as may be
            available and as may be prudent are taken to enforce the security
            constituted by the relevant Aircraft Security Documents,

      PROVIDED ALWAYS that, for the avoidance of doubt, if any National Agent
      shall have given a Notice for Action pursuant to Paragraph 10.4(B) and any
      other National Agent shall have given or, as the case may be, shall give a
      Notice for Inaction pursuant to Paragraph 10.4(A) or a Notice of
      Reservation of Rights pursuant to Paragraph 10.5, the Agent shall
      disregard the Notice(s) for Inaction and/or Notice(s) of Reservation of
      Rights and shall act in accordance with the Notice for Action.

10.5  RESERVATION OF RIGHTS

      If, within thirty (30) days after the Agent has given a Notice of Event,
      each of the National Agents (at the request of their respective Export
      Credit Agencies) have given to the Agent and the Security Trustee a notice
      in writing requiring it to do so (provided that the Agent does not receive
      a Notice for Action pursuant to Paragraph 10.4(B) within such period), the
      Security Trustee shall by notice in writing to the Lessee and any other
      relevant party (a "NOTICE OF RESERVATION OF RIGHTS") reserve all of its
      rights under the Transaction Documents arising as a consequence of the
      occurrence of the Termination Event in question, which notice shall
      require GFC and/or any other relevant party to remedy such Termination
      Event within a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which the
      Notice of Reservation of Rights is given or such other period as the
      National Agents may agree and notify to the Security Trustee in writing.
      Upon the expiry of the period specified in any Notice of Reservation of
      Rights, the

                                    Page 135

<PAGE>

      Security Trustee shall, if it is instructed in writing to do so by all of
      the National Agents (at the request of their respective Export Credit
      Agencies) prior to the expiry of such period (provided the Agent does not
      receive a Notice for Action pursuant to Paragraph 10.4(B) within such
      period), give to the Lessee a further Notice of Reservation of Rights,
      save only that the period given for remedying the relevant Event of
      Default shall be thirty (30) days after the giving of the further Notice
      of Reservation of Rights or such other period as the National Agents may
      agree and notify to the Security Trustee in writing.
