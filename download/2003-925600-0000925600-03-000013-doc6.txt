                       (hereafter called the "Reinsurer")


It  is  understood  and  agreed  that this addendum amends addendum Number 3 and
effective  January 1st, 2002 the following articles or parts thereof are amended
to  read  as  follows.

ARTICLE  II                    TERM  AND  TERMINATION

The agreement commences at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, January 1, 2000 and
shall remain in force until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, December 31, 2002.
Either party may terminate effective on the first day of any calendar month with
20  days  advance  written  notice.  The  Reinsurer shall remain liable for loss
under  reinsured  policies effective prior to the termination date.  However, in
the  event  the Company fails to pay the Reinsurer on or before October 15, 2002
for  the  monthly  account  statements  from January through September 2002 this
addendum  is  cancelled  ab  initio  and  the  agreement is terminated as of the
expiration  date  heretofore  applicable  which  is  December  31,  2001.

ARTICLE  IV                    QUOTA  SHARE  PARTICIPATION

The  aggregate  quota  share  cession  shall be at the option of the Company and
subject  to  a  maximum  of 75% for the year 2002.  However, the maximum cession
will be limited to $60,000,000 of written premium.  In the event the quota share
percent  selected by the Company produces more than $60,000,000 for the calendar
year,  the  dollar  amount  of  written  premium  ceded  shall  be  reduced  to
$60,000,000.  This  limit  can  be  increased  by  mutual  agreement between the
Reinsurer  and the Company.  The Company shall notify the Reinsurer prior to the
last  day  of  the calendar quarter of the quota share percent for that quarter.
It  is  agreed that the cession for any one quarter, shall not exceed 40% of the
total  cession for the calendar year.  In the event the declared percent cession
for  a  calendar quarter produces premiums in excess of 40% of the premium ceded
for  the  calendar  year  the cessions for that quarter shall be adjusted to the
dollar  amount  that  would  equal  40%  of  the  premium  ceded  for  the year.

The  Reinsurer's  liability  for  aggregate  losses,  including  allocated  loss
adjustment  expenses  (and unallocated loss adjustment expenses where applicable
under  REPORTS  AND ACCOUNTING), shall be limited to 97% of earned premium ceded
for  all  business  from  January  1st,  2002  to  the  calculation  date.

The  Company  will  pay  the  Reinsurer a premium equal to the pro rata share of
premium  applicable  on  all  policies  ceded  and the Reinsurer shall allow the
company a minimum and provisional ceding commission of 18% on such premium.  The
ceding  commission slides 1 for 1 for each 1.0% decrease in the Loss Ratio below
79%  up  to  a  maximum  ceding  commission  of  31%  at a 66% loss ratio.  This
calculation  shall  be  from  January  1st,  2001 to date for all business ceded
