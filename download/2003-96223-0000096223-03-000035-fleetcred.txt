         SECTION 2.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
                     -------------------------

         2.1.  Revolving Credit Commitment.
               ----------------------------

               (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each of the Banks
severally  agrees to make  revolving  credit loans  (individually,  a "Revolving
Credit Loan" and,  collectively the "Revolving  Credit Loans") in Dollars and/or
Optional Currency to the Company from time to time during the Commitment Period,
upon notice by the Company to the Administrative  Agent given in accordance with
Section 2.3 hereof and subject to the  following  paragraphs  (b) and (c), in an
amount equal to such Bank's  Commitment  Percentage of the  aggregate  principal
amount of Loans requested in the Company's notice. The respective amount of each
Bank's  Commitment  and its  Commitment  Percentage  shall  be as set  forth  in
Schedule 1 attached hereto.

               (b)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this  Agreement but
subject to the following paragraph (c) of this Section 2.1, at no time shall the
Dollar Equivalent of the sum of the aggregate  principal amount of all Revolving
Credit Loans  outstanding  (after giving effect to all Loans  requested) and all
Swing Line Loans  outstanding  exceed the Total  Commitment of the Banks then in
effect.  The Dollar  Equivalent of the principal  amount of the Revolving Credit
Loans  outstanding from each Bank to the Company shall not at any time exceed in
the aggregate an amount (after  giving effect to all Loans  requested)  equal to
such Bank's Commitment  Percentage times (i) the Total Commitment minus (ii) the
sum of the  aggregate  principal  amount of all Swing  Line  Loans  outstanding.
Within  the  foregoing  limits,  and  subject  to  all of the  other  terms  and
conditions set forth in this Agreement,  the Company may borrow, prepay pursuant
to Section 2.7 hereof, and reborrow Revolving Credit Loans.

               (c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  each of the Banks agrees to,
on one or more occasions during the Commitment Period, and regardless of whether
the conditions set forth in Section 6 are satisfied, make Revolving Credit Loans
to the Company  solely for the purposes of repaying Swing Line Loans pursuant to
Section 3.4 hereof. Section 3 hereof shall govern the Company's obligations with
respect to Swing Line Loans. In the event that any advances of Revolving  Credit
Loans pursuant to this Section  2.1(c) cause the sum of the aggregate  principal
amount of Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans  outstanding to exceed the
Total  Commitment  then in effect,  the Company  shall  immediately  prepay such
excess amount together with any interest accrued thereon.

                                       13
<PAGE>

               (d) The Revolving Credit Loans may be Eurocurrency Loans or Prime
Rate Loans, or combinations  thereof,  as determined by the Company and notified
to the  Administrative  Agent  and the Banks in  accordance  with  Section  2.3;
provided  that no  Eurocurrency  Loan  shall  be made  with an  Interest  Period
extending  beyond the Termination  Date. Each Prime Rate Loan or Swing Line Loan
shall be denominated in Dollars, and each Eurocurrency Loan shall be denominated
in  Dollars  or,  subject  to  Section  2.4  hereof,  in an  Optional  Currency.
Eurocurrency Loans shall be made and maintained by the Administrative  Agent for
the accounts of the Banks at its  Eurocurrency  Lending  Office,  and Prime Rate
Loans shall be made and maintained by the Administrative  Agent for the accounts
of the Banks at its Domestic Lending Office.

         2.2. Notes. The  Revolving  Credit  Loans  made  pursuant  hereto  are
              -----
evidenced by separate promissory notes of the Company, substantially in the form
of Exhibit A (together  with any  promissory  notes in  substantially  such form
issued in substitution or replacement therefor, the "Revolving Credit Notes" or,
in the singular,  a "Revolving  Credit Note");  one Revolving  Credit Note being
payable to the order of each Bank in a  principal  amount  equal to such  Bank's
Commitment  and  representing  the obligation of the Company to pay to such Bank
the amount of the Commitment or, if less, the aggregate  unpaid principal amount
of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such Bank hereunder, plus accrued interest
thereon,  as set forth below.  Each Bank is hereby authorized to record the date
and amount of its Revolving Credit Loan, the maturity date thereof, the date and
amount of each repayment of principal thereof,  and, in the case of Eurocurrency
Loans, the interest rate with respect thereto,  on such Bank's Note Record.  The
outstanding  amount of the Revolving  Credit Loans set forth on such Bank's Note
Record shall be prima facie  evidence of the principal  amount thereof owing and
unpaid to such Bank,  but the failure to record,  or any error in so  recording,
any such amount on such Bank's Note Record shall not limit or  otherwise  affect
the actual  amount of the  obligations  of the  Company  hereunder  or under any
Revolving  Credit  Note to make  payments  of  principal  of or  interest on any
Revolving Credit Note when due.

         2.3.  Procedure for Revolving Credit Borrowing.
               -----------------------------------------

               (a) The  Company  may borrow  Revolving  Credit  Loans  under the
Commitments  during the Commitment Period on any Business Day;  provided,  that,
the Company  shall give the  Administrative  Agent  irrevocable  notice (a "Loan
Request"),  which  notice  must  be  in  writing  (or  by  confirmed  electronic
communication or by telephone  confirmed in writing) and must be received by the
Administrative  Agent (i) prior to 10:00 A.M.,  Boston  time three (3)  Business
Days prior to the requested  Borrowing Date, in the case of Eurocurrency  Loans,
and (ii)  prior to 12:00  noon  Boston  time one (1)  Business  Day prior to the
requested  Borrowing  Date, in the case of Prime Rate Loans,  specifying (A) the
principal  amount  of the  Revolving  Credit  Loan  requested,  stated in either
Dollars or (subject  to Section  2.4) an Optional  Currency,  (B) the  requested
Borrowing  Date,  (C) whether the  borrowing is to be a  Eurocurrency  Loan or a
Prime  Rate  Loan,  or  a  combination  thereof  (and,  if a  Eurocurrency  Loan
denominated  in an Optional  Currency is requested,  such Loan Request must also
comply with the  requirements of an OC Request  pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof),
and (D) the length of the Interest Period for each Eurocurrency Loan included in
such notice.  No more than ten (10) Eurocurrency  Loans with different  Interest
Periods shall be outstanding at one time.  Promptly upon receipt of such notice,
the Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Banks thereof.  Each borrowing
of Prime Rate Loans pursuant to the Commitments  shall be in a minimum aggregate
principal amount equal to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
$250,000  in  excess  thereof,  and  (ii)  the  aggregate  amount  of the  Total
Commitment  in excess of the sum of all Loans  outstanding.  Each  borrowing  of

                                       14
<PAGE>

Eurocurrency  Loans  pursuant to the  Commitments  shall be in a minimum  amount
equal to $5,000,000  and shall be in an integral  multiple of $500,000 in excess
thereof.


               (b) Not  later  than  2:00 P.M.  (Boston  time) on any  requested
Borrowing Date (including  without  limitation  pursuant to notice under Section
3.4 with regard to the repayment of any Swing Line Loan), each of the Banks will
make available to the  Administrative  Agent, at its head office, in immediately
available  funds,  the amount of the Revolving Credit Loan to be loaned by it on
such Borrowing  Date. Upon receipt from each Bank of the amount of its Revolving
Credit Loan,  the  Administrative  Agent will make the aggregate  amount of such
Revolving  Credit Loans available to the Company.  The failure or refusal of any
Bank to make available to the Administrative  Agent at the aforesaid time on any
Borrowing  Date the amount of the Revolving  Credit Loan to be made by such Bank
shall not relieve any other Bank from its several obligations  hereunder to make
its respective Commitment Percentage of any requested Loans.

               (c) The Administrative Agent may (unless notified to the contrary
by a Bank prior to a Borrowing Date) assume that each Bank has made available to
the  Administrative   Agent  on  such  Borrowing  Date  such  Bank's  Commitment
Percentage of the Revolving  Credit Loans to be made on such Borrowing Date, and
the Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon
such assumption,  make available to the Company a corresponding  amount.  If any
Bank makes  available  all or any portion of such  amount to the  Administrative
Agent on a date after such Borrowing  Date,  then such Delinquent Bank shall pay
to the Administrative  Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the
average  computed  for the period  referred  to in clause  (iii)  below,  of the
Overnight Rate for each day included in such period, times (ii) the amount equal
to the lesser of such Bank's  Commitment  Percentage  of such  borrowing  or the
portion  thereof  made  available  after  such  Borrowing  Date,  times  (iii) a
fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the number of days that  elapse  from and
including  such  Borrowing  Date to the date on  which  such  Bank's  Commitment
Percentage  of  such  borrowing  shall  become  immediately   available  to  the
Administrative  Agent,  and the  denominator of which is 365. A statement of the
Administrative  Agent  submitted to any Bank with  respect to any amounts  owing
under this paragraph  shall be prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing.
If any portion of such Bank's Commitment  Percentage of such Loan is not in fact
made  available to the  Administrative  Agent by such Bank within three Business
Days of such  Borrowing  Date,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall be entitled to
recover  such amount from the Company on demand,  with  interest  thereon at the
rate per annum applicable to the Loans made on such Borrowing Date.

               (d) If the Administrative Agent, for the account of a Bank, makes
a new Revolving Credit Loan on a day on which the Company is to repay all or any
part of any outstanding  Revolving  Credit Loan denominated in the same currency
from such Bank,  such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such
repayment,  and only an amount  equal to the  difference  (if any)  between  the
amount being  borrowed  and the amount  being repaid shall be made  available by
such Bank to the  Company or remitted by the Company to such Bank as provided in
Section 4.8, as the case may be.

         2.4.  Procedure for Optional Currencies.
               --------- --- -------- ----------

               (a) Request for Optional Currency. Subject to the limitations
                   ------- --- -------- --------
set forth in Section  2.1, the Company may upon not less than three (3) Business
Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (an "OC Request"),  request that one or
more  Revolving  Credit  Loans  be made as  Eurocurrency  Loans  in an  Optional
Currency,  provided that any  Eurocurrency  Loan requested shall be in an amount
not less than  $5,000,000,  and shall be in an integral  multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof.  Each OC Request shall be in writing (or by confirmed electronic

                                       15

<PAGE>

communication  or by  telephone  confirmed  in  writing)  and shall  specify (in
addition to  compliance  with the  requirements  of a Loan  Request  pursuant to
Section 2.3(a)):  (i) the Optional  Currency in which the  Eurocurrency  Loan is
requested to be made and (ii), in the case of an Optional  Currency which is the
legal tender of a country in which the  Administrative  Agent has no office, the
Company's  account  with a depository  in such  country to which  payment of the
proceeds of such  Eurocurrency  Loan is requested to be made. If any Bank, on or
prior to the second (2nd)  Business Day  preceding the first day of any Interest
Period for which an OC Request has been delivered requesting a Eurocurrency Loan
in an Optional Currency or on any funding date,  determines (which determination
shall  be  conclusive)  that  the  Optional  Currency  requested  is not  freely
transferable and convertible  into Dollars or that it will be impracticable  for
such Bank to fund the requested Revolving Credit Loan in such Optional Currency,
then such Bank  shall so notify the  Administrative  Agent,  which  notification
shall be given immediately by the Administrative  Agent to the Company, and such
Bank's portion of the requested Revolving Credit Loan shall, notwithstanding any
contrary election by the Company or any other provisions  hereof, be denominated
in Dollars as a Prime Rate Loan unless the  Company,  one (1) Business Day prior
to the  commencement  of such Interest  Period and by notice  complying with the
requirements  of Section  2.3(a)  hereof,  elects to have such Bank's  Revolving
Credit Loan denominated in Dollars as a Eurocurrency Loan. In the event that the
Company repays such portion of a Revolving Credit Loan denominated in Dollars as
a Prime Rate Loan or a Eurocurrency Loan, as the case may be, in accordance with
Section 2.7 and such  repayment  results in Revolving  Credit Loans  outstanding
that  are not pro rata in  accordance  with the  Commitment  Percentages  of the
Banks,  then all  subsequent  principal  repayments  denominated in the Optional
Currency which the applicable  Bank did not advance shall be made by the Company
to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of such Banks other than
the Bank which did not advance the  Optional  Currency on a pro rata basis until
such time as the  Revolving  Credit Loans are  outstanding  on a pro rata basis.
Subject to the foregoing and to the  satisfaction of the terms and conditions of
Section  6, each  Revolving  Credit  Loan  requested  to be made in an  Optional
Currency  shall be made on the  date  specified  therefor  in the  related  Loan
Request,  in the currency requested in the related OC Request and, upon being so
made, will have the Interest Period requested in the related Loan Request.

               (b) Exchange Rate. For purpose of this Agreement the amount
                   -------- ----
in one currency which shall be equivalent on any particular  date to a specified
amount in another currency shall be that amount (as conclusively  ascertained by
the Administrative Agent by its normal banking practices, absent manifest error)
in the first currency which is or could be purchased by the Administrative Agent
in accordance  with its normal banking  practices with such specified  amount in
the second currency in any recognized  Eurocurrency Interbank Market selected by
the  Administrative  Agent in good faith for  delivery  on such date at the spot
rate of exchange  prevailing at 10:00 a.m.  (Boston time), or as soon thereafter
as practicable, on such date.

               (c) Denominations. In the event that any portion of the funds
                   -------------
available  under the  terms of this  Agreement  is  denominated  in an  Optional
Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of such portion of the funds shall be calculated
pursuant to Section 2.4(b) above.  The amount so determined  shall then be added
to the amount already  outstanding in Dollars for the purpose of determining the
remaining  availability  of funds  under  Section  2.1 hereof  and any  required
repayments under the following Section 2.4(d).

               (d) Repayment. If at any time prior to the Termination Date
                   ---------
the Dollar  Equivalent  of the aggregate  principal  amount  outstanding  of all
Revolving  Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans shall  exceed the Total  Commitment
for three (3) or more  consecutive  Business Days as a result of fluctuations in
applicable  conversion  rates between Dollars and any Optional  Currencies,  the
Company  shall  pay or cause to be paid  immediately,  upon  demand  made by the
Administrative  Agent,  such amounts as are  sufficient to eliminate such excess
and  to  reduce  the  aggregate  principal  amount  outstanding  to  the  Dollar
Equivalent of the Total Commitment.  In the event there are any Revolving Credit
Loans   outstanding  which  are  denominated  in  an  Optional   Currency,   the
Administrative  Agent shall provide the Banks and the Company with  calculations
on the last day of each calendar month that such Loans are outstanding as to the
Dollar Equivalents of such Revolving Credit Loans.

               (e) Funding. Each Bank may make any Eurocurrency Loan
                   -------
denominated  in an Optional  Currency by causing any of its foreign  branches or
foreign affiliates to make such Eurocurrency Loan (whether or not such branch or
affiliate is named as a lending office on the signature pages hereof);  provided
that in such event the obligation of the Company to repay such Eurocurrency Loan
shall nevertheless be to such Bank and shall, for all purposes of this Agreement
(including  without  limitation  for  purposes  of the  definition  of the  term
"Majority  Banks")  be  deemed  made  by  such  Bank,  to  the  extent  of  such
Eurocurrency Loan, for the account of such branch or affiliate.

         2.5.  Interest Rate.
               -------------

               (a) Each  Eurocurrency  Loan shall bear interest,  for the period
commencing  on the  Borrowing  Date  thereof  and  ending on the last day of the
Interest Period with respect thereto,  on the unpaid principal amount thereof at
a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined by the Administrative
Agent for the Interest  Period  therefor  plus the  Eurocurrency  Margin (as set
forth in the Applicable Pricing).

               (b) Each  Prime  Rate Loan  shall  bear  interest  for the period
commencing on the Borrowing Date thereof on the unpaid  principal amount thereof
at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate.

         2.6.   Conversion Options.
                ------------------

               (a) The  Company  may elect  from  time to time,  by  request  (a
"Conversion Request") in writing (or by confirmed electronic communication or by
telephone  confirmed in writing),  to convert any outstanding Loan (other than a
Swing Line Loan) denominated in Dollars to a Loan of another Type denominated in
Dollars, provided that (i) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurocurrency
Loan to a Prime Rate Loan,  the Company shall give the  Administrative  Agent at
least one (1)  Business Day prior  written  notice of such  election;  (ii) with
respect to any such conversion of a Prime Rate Loan to a Eurocurrency  Loan, the
Company shall give the  Administrative  Agent at least three (3) Business  Days'
prior written notice of such election; (iii) with respect to any such conversion
of a Eurocurrency  Loan into a Prime Rate Loan,  such  conversion  shall only be
made on the last day of the Interest  Period with respect  thereto,  and (iv) no
Prime Rate Loan may be converted  into a  Eurocurrency  Loan when any Default or
Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing.  On the date on which such
conversion  is being made each Bank shall take such  action as is  necessary  to
transfer  its  portion  of such  Loans to its  Domestic  Lending  Office  or its
Eurocurrency  Lending Office, as the case may be. All or any part of outstanding
Revolving Credit Loans of any Type may be converted into a Revolving Credit Loan
of another Type as provided  herein,  provided that any conversion  shall comply
with the minimum  aggregate  principal amount  requirements set forth in Section
2.3(a).  Each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Prime Rate Loan
to a Eurocurrency Loan shall be irrevocable by the Company.

               (b) Any  Revolving  Credit Loan of any Type may be continued as a
Revolving Credit Loan of the same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period
with respect  thereto by  compliance  by the Company with the notice  provisions

                                       17
<PAGE>


contained in Section  2.6(a)  hereof;  provided that (i) as to any  Eurocurrency
Loan denominated in Dollars,  no such Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such
when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing,  but shall
be  automatically  converted  to a Prime  Rate Loan on the last day of the first
Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or
Event of Default of which officers of the  Administrative  Agent active upon the
account have actual knowledge;  and (ii) as to any Eurocurrency Loan denominated
in an Optional Currency, no such Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such when
any Default or Event of Default  has  occurred  or is  continuing,  but shall be
repaid by the Company on the last day of the Interest Period  relating  thereto.
In the event that the  Company  fails to provide  any  Conversion  Request  with
respect to the continuation of any Eurocurrency Loan as such, then (x) as to any
Eurocurrency  Loan  denominated  in  Dollars,  such  Eurocurrency  Loan shall be
automatically  converted  to a Prime  Rate  Loan on the  last  day of the  first
Interest  Period  relating  thereto,   and  (y)  as  to  any  Eurocurrency  Loan
denominated in an Optional  Currency,  such Eurocurrency Loan shall be repaid on
the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.  The Administrative  Agent
shall notify the Banks promptly when any such automatic conversion  contemplated
by this Section 2.6(b) is scheduled to occur.


               (c) Any conversion to or from Eurocurrency Loans shall be in such
amounts and be made  pursuant to such  elections so that,  after  giving  effect
thereto,  the aggregate  principal amount of all  Eurocurrency  Loans having the
same Interest  Period shall not be less than  $5,000,000 or a whole  multiple of
$500,000 in excess thereof (or, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in
an  Optional  Currency,  that  whole  number  which  is  nearest  to the  Dollar
Equivalent of $5,000,000 or $500,000, as the case may be, rounded to the nearest
one  thousandth).  No more  than  ten (10)  Eurocurrency  Loans  with  different
Interest Periods shall be outstanding at one time.

         2.7. Termination or Reduction of Commitment. The Company shall have the
              ----------- -- --------- -- ----------
right,  upon not less than five (5) Business Days' notice to the  Administrative
Agent,  to  terminate  the Total  Commitment  or, from time to time,  reduce the
amount of the Total Commitment, provided, that, (i) each reduction (other than a
termination)  shall  be in a  minimum  amount  of  $10,000,000  and in  integral
multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, (ii) no such reduction or termination
shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the
Loans made on the effective date thereof, the then outstanding  principal amount
of the Loans would exceed the amount of the Total  Commitment then in effect and
(iii) each Bank's  Commitment shall be reduced  proportionately.  Termination of
the Commitments  shall also terminate the obligation of the Banks to make Loans.
The portions of Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be reinstated.

         2.8. Increase of Total Commitment; Additional Banks. The Company shall
              -------- -- ----- ----------  ---------- -----
have  the  right  upon  one  or  more   occasions  by  written   notice  to  the
Administrative Agent (a "Commitment Increase Request") to request an increase in
the Total  Commitment  (the amount of increase  requested on any occasion  being
referred to herein as the "Increase  Amount"),  up to a maximum Total Commitment
of $175,000,000;  provided that, at the time of the Commitment  Increase Request
and at the time such  request  would  become  effective,  no Default or Event of
Default has occurred  and is  continuing  or would exist after giving  effect to
such increase in the Total Commitment.  Following a Commitment Increase Request,
one or more other  Entities  which  would  qualify as an Eligible  Assignee  (an
"Additional Bank") and which are acceptable to each of the Administrative  Agent
and Company may be admitted as a Bank party to this Agreement in accordance with
the  provisions  of Section  11.10,  provided  that the  Commitment  of any such
Additional  Bank  shall  not be less  than  $10,000,000  nor  greater  than  the
difference between the new Total Commitment and the aggregate Commitments of the
other  Banks  (including  the  Commitment  of any other  Additional  Bank  being

                                       18
<PAGE>


admitted at the same time as a Bank party to this Agreement).  Any such increase
in the Total  Commitment  shall become effective only upon written notice by the
Administrative  Agent to the Company and the Banks specifying the effective date
of such increase in Total Commitment, together with a revised Schedule 1 stating
the new Total Commitment, and, in respect thereof, the Commitment Amount of each
Additional Bank, the respective continuing Commitment Amounts of the other Banks
and the new Commitment  Percentages of the Banks. Upon the effective date of the
increased  Total  Commitment,  each Additional Bank shall make all (if any) such
payments  to the other  Banks as may be  necessary  to result in the  respective
Revolving  Credit Loans held by such  Additional  Bank and the other Banks being
equal to such  applicable  Bank's  Commitment  Percentage  (as set  forth in the
revised  Schedule 1) of the aggregate  principal  amount of all Revolving Credit
Loans outstanding as of such date. The Company hereby agrees that any Additional
Bank so paying any such  amount to the other  Banks  pursuant  to the  preceding
sentence  shall be  entitled  to all the  rights  of a Bank  having  Commitments
hereunder  in respect of such  amounts,  that such  payments to such other Banks
shall thereafter  constitute Revolving Credit Loans made by such Additional Bank
hereunder and that such Additional Bank may, to the fullest extent  permitted by
law, exercise all of its right of payment  (including the right of set-off) with
respect  to such  amounts  as fully  as if such  Additional  Bank had  initially
advanced  to the  Company  directly  the  amount of such  payments.  If any such
adjustment  payments pursuant to the preceding sentences of this Section 2.8 are
made by an  Additional  Bank to other  Banks at a time  other than the end of an
Interest  Period in the case of all or any  portion of  Revolving  Credit  Loans
constituting  Eurocurrency  Loans,  the  Company  shall pay to each of the Banks
receiving  any such  payment,  at the time that such payment is made pursuant to
Section  2.8,  the  amount  that  would be  required  to be paid by the  Company
pursuant to Section 4.12 had such payments been made directly by the Company.

         2.9. Prepayments. The Company may (i) at any time and from time to time
              -----------
prepay the Prime Rate Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty and
(ii)  subject to payment of the  amounts set forth in Section  4.12,  prepay the
Eurocurrency  Loans, in either case upon at least one Business Day's irrevocable
notice to the Administrative Agent, specifying the date and amount of prepayment
and whether the prepayment is of  Eurocurrency  Loans or Prime Rate Loans,  or a
combination  thereof,  and if of a combination thereof, the amount of prepayment
allocable  to each.  If such  notice is given,  the  Administrative  Agent shall
thereupon  transmit  such  notice to the  Banks,  the  Company  shall  make such
prepayment to the  Administrative  Agent for the accounts of the Banks,  and the
prepayment  amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified  therein,  together  with accrued  interest to such date on the amount
prepaid.  Partial prepayments shall be in an amount equal to $100,000 or a whole
multiple  thereof and may only be made if, after giving effect thereto,  Section
2.7  shall not have  been  contravened,  and each  partial  prepayment  shall be
allocated  among the Banks,  in  proportion,  as nearly as  practicable,  to the
respective  unpaid  principal  amount of each Bank's Revolving Credit Note, with
adjustments  to the extent  practical  to  equalize  any prior  prepayments  not
exactly in proportion.

         2.10. Repayment of Loans. The Company will pay to the Administrative
               --------- -- -----
Agent  for the  accounts  of the  Banks  the  unpaid  principal  amount  of each
Revolving  Credit Loan,  to the extent not  converted  or continued  pursuant to
Section 2.6, on the last day of the Interest Period therefor. On the Termination
Date, there shall become absolutely due and payable and the Company will pay all
of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding, together with any and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon.

         SECTION 3.  SWING LINE FACILITY
                     -------------------

         3.1. The Swing Line Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
              --- ----- ---- -----
hereinafter set forth, upon notice by the Company made to the Swing Line Bank in
accordance  with  Section 3.2 hereof,  the Swing Line Bank agrees to lend to the
Company Swing Line Loans on any Business Day during the Commitment  Period in an
aggregate  principal  amount not to exceed  $10,000,000 (the "Maximum Swing Line
Loan  Amount").  Each  Swing  Line  Loan  shall  be in such  minimum  amount  as

                                       19

<PAGE>


determined by the Swing Line Bank.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement and in addition to the limit set forth above, (a) at no time shall the
aggregate  principal amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans exceed the Total
Commitment of the Banks then in effect minus the aggregate  principal  amount of
all Revolving Credit Loans  outstanding,  provided however that,  subject to the
limitations  set  forth  in this  Section,  from  time  to  time  the sum of the
aggregate  outstanding  Swing Line Loans plus all outstanding  Revolving  Credit
Loans made by the Swing Line Bank may  exceed the Swing Line  Bank's  Commitment
then in effect.

         3.2. Notice of Borrowing. When the Company desires the Swing Line Bank
              ------ -- ---------
to make a Swing Line Loan,  it shall  give to the  Administrative  Agent and the
Swing Line Bank irrevocable  notice (a "SL Loan Request"),  which notice must be
in writing (or by confirmed  electronic  communication or by telephone confirmed
in  writing),  and which shall set forth the  principal  amount of the  proposed
Swing Line Loan and the date on which the proposed  Swing Line Loan would mature
(the "Swing Line Loan Maturity  Date") which shall be not earlier than the first
day after the  Borrowing  Date nor later than the third day after the  Borrowing
Date thereof, and in no event shall be later than the last day of the Commitment
Period. Each such Loan request must be received by the Swing Line Bank not later
than 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the date of the proposed  borrowing.  Each Swing
Line Loan  request  shall be  irrevocable  and  binding on the Company and shall
obligate  the  Company  to borrow the Swing  Line Loan from the  Borrowing  Date
thereof.  Upon  satisfaction  of the  applicable  conditions  set  forth in this
Agreement,  on the  proposed  Borrowing  Date the Swing Line Bank shall make the
Swing  Line Loan  available  to the  Company by 5:00 p.m.  (Boston  time) on the
proposed  Borrowing  Date by crediting  the amount of the Swing Line Loan to the
Company's account maintained with the  Administrative  Agent at the Head Office;
provided  that the Swing Line Bank shall not  advance any Swing Line Loans after
it has  received  notice that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and has
not been cured or waived in accordance  with the  provisions of this  Agreement.
The Swing Line Bank shall not be  obligated  to make any Swing Line Loans at any
time when any Bank is a  Delinquent  Bank unless the Swing Line Bank has entered
into  arrangements  satisfactory  to it to eliminate  the Swing Line Bank's risk
with respect to such Delinquent  Bank,  including by cash  collateralizing  such
Delinquent Bank's Commitment  Percentage of the outstanding Swing Line Loans and
any such additional Swing Line Loans to be made.

         3.3. Interest on Swing Line Loans. Each Swing Line Loan shall bear
              -------- -- ----- ---- -----
interest from the Borrowing Date thereof until the Swing Line Loan Maturity Date
thereof at the rate quoted by the  Administrative  Agent in its sole  discretion
(which shall not be greater than the then applicable Prime Rate) at the time the
request for such Swing Line Loan is made.

         3.4. Repayment of Swing Line Loans. The Company shall repay each
              --------- -- ----- ---- -----
outstanding Swing Line Loan on the Swing Line Loan Maturity Date. Upon notice by
the Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, the Company shall be deemed irrevocably
to have  requested,  and each of the Banks  hereby  agrees to make,  a Revolving
Credit  Loan  bearing  interest  at the Prime  Rate to the  Company  on the next
succeeding Business Day following such notice, in an amount equal to such Bank's
Commitment   Percentage  of  the  aggregate  amount  of  all  Swing  Line  Loans
outstanding.  The proceeds  thereof shall be applied directly to repay the Swing
Line  Bank for such  outstanding  Swing  Line  Loans.  In the  event  that it is

                                       20
<PAGE>


impracticable  for such  Revolving  Credit Loan to be made for any reason on the
date  otherwise  required  above,  then each Bank  hereby  agrees  that it shall
forthwith  purchase (as of the date such  Revolving  Credit Loan would have been
made,  but adjusted for any payments  received from the Company on or after such
date and prior to such  purchase)  from the Swing Line Bank,  and the Swing Line
Bank  shall  sell to each  Bank,  such  participations  in the Swing  Line Loans
(including  all accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon)  outstanding  as shall be
necessary to cause the Banks to share in such Swing Line Loans pro rata based on
their  respective  Commitment  Percentages by making available to the Swing Line
Bank an amount  equal to such  Bank's  participation  in the Swing  Line  Loans;
provided  that all  interest  payable on the Swing  Line Loans  shall be for the
account of the Swing  Line Bank as a funding  and  administrative  fee until the
date as of which the respective  participation  is purchased.  The obligation of
each Bank to make such Revolving  Credit Loan, or as the case may be to purchase
such  participation  in a Swing Line Loan, upon one Business Day's notice as set
forth above, is absolute, unconditional and irrevocable notwithstanding (i) that
the amount of such Loan may not comply with the applicable minimums set forth in
Section 2.3 hereof,  (ii) the failure of the Company to meet the  conditions set
forth in Section 6 hereof,  (iii) the  occurrence or continuance of a Default or
an Event of Default  hereunder,  (iv) the date of such Revolving  Credit Loan or
participation,  and (v) the  Commitment of the Swing Line Bank in effect at such
time.

         3.5. The Swing Line Note. The obligation of the Company to repay the
              --- ----- ---- ----
Swing Line Loans made pursuant to this Agreement and to pay interest  thereon as
set forth in this  Agreement  shall be  evidenced  by a  promissory  note of the
Company  with  appropriate  insertions  substantially  in the form of  Exhibit B
attached  hereto (the "Swing Line Note"),  of even date  herewith and payable to
the order of the Swing Line Bank in a principal  amount  stated to be the lesser
of (i) the  Maximum  Swing Line Loan  Amount,  or (ii) the  aggregate  principal
amount of Swing  Line  Loans at any time  advanced  by the  Swing  Line Bank and
outstanding  thereunder.  The Company irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Bank
to make or cause to be made, at or about the time of the  Borrowing  Date of any
Swing  Line Loan or at the time of receipt of any  payment of  principal  on the
Swing Line Note,  an  appropriate  notation  on the Note Record  reflecting  the
making  of such  Swing  Line  Loan or (as the case may be) the  receipt  of such
payment.  The outstanding  amount of the Swing Line Loans set forth on such Note
Record shall be prima facie  evidence of the principal  amount thereof owing and
unpaid to the Swing Line  Bank,  but the  failure to record,  or any error in so
recording,  any such  amount on such Note  Record  shall not limit or  otherwise
affect the actual amount of the  obligations  of the Company  hereunder or under
the Swing Line Note to make  payments of  principal  of or interest on the Swing
Line Note when due.

         SECTION 4.  CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS
                     --------------------------

         4.1. Use of Proceeds. The Company shall use the proceeds of the Loans
              --- -- --------
to refinance  existing debt set forth on Schedule 4.1 and for general  corporate
purposes in the ordinary course of its business.  No part of the proceeds of any
Loans  hereunder  will be used (a) for  "purchasing"  or "carrying"  any "margin
security" or "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted
terms under Regulations U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System as now and from time to time  hereafter in effect  unless (i) the Company
shall have  theretofore  furnished to the Banks a statement  on Federal  Reserve
Form U-1 with  respect  to such  Loans or (ii) not more than 25% of the value of
the  assets of either the  Company  or the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  on a
consolidated  basis,  respectively,  is  represented  by  "margin  stock"  as so
defined,  or (b) for any purpose which violates,  or which would be inconsistent
with, the provisions of the Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

         4.2. Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative
              -------- ---
Agent  for the  accounts  of the  Banks  in  accordance  with  their  respective
Commitment  Percentages a facility fee (the  "Facility  Fee")  calculated at the
Facility Fee Rate (as set forth in the Applicable  Pricing) on the amount of the
Total  Commitment,  payable  quarterly in arrears on each June 30, September 30,
December 31 and March 31, and the  Termination  Date or such earlier date as the
Commitment  shall  terminate as provided  herein  (without regard to whether any
Loans  by  any of  the  Banks  is or  have  been  outstanding  and  whether  the
availability  of any Bank's  Commitment  is or has been  reduced by  outstanding
Swing Line Loans).

                                       21
<PAGE>


         4.3. Utilization Fee. For each day on which the Utilized Amount exceeds
              ----------- ---
33.33% of the Total  Commitment as in effect on such date, the Company agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Banks in accordance with
their  respective   Commitment   Percentages  (without  regard  to  whether  the
availability  of any Bank's  Commitment  is or has been  reduced by  outstanding
Swing Line Loans) a utilization fee (the  "Utilization  Fee")  calculated at the
rate per annum of 0.125% on the Utilized Amount, payable quarterly in arrears on
each June 30,  September  30,  December 31 and March 31, and on the  Termination
Date or such earlier date as the Commitment shall terminate as provided herein.

         4.4. Agent's Fees. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
              ------- ----
on  the  date  hereof,  an  Administrative  Agent's  closing  fee  and  on  each
anniversary of such date, up to but not including the  Termination  Date or such
earlier  date  as  the  Commitment  shall  terminate  as  provided  herein,   an
administration fee, in each case for the Administrative  Agent's own account, as
set  forth  in  a  certain  letter   agreement   between  the  Company  and  the
Administrative  Agent.  The Company shall pay to the Syndication  Agent a fee as
set forth in a certain letter agreement  between the Company and the Syndication
Agent.

         4.5. Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest in respect of Prime
              ----------- -- -------- --- ----
Rate Loans  shall be  calculated  on the basis of a 365-day  year for the actual
number of days elapsed  (including  the first day but  excluding  the last day).
Facility Fees and interest in respect of Eurocurrency Loans and Swing Line Loans
shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days
elapsed.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall as soon as  practicable  notify  the
Company and the Banks of each  determination of a Eurocurrency  Rate. Any change
in the interest rate on a Loan  resulting  from a change in the Prime Rate shall
become  effective  as of the opening of business on the day on which such change
in the  Prime  Rate is  announced.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall as soon as
practicable notify the Company of the effective date and the amount of each such
change.  The outstanding  amount of the Loans as reflected on the Administrative
Agent's records from time to time shall be considered correct and binding on the
Company and the Banks  unless  within five  Business  Days after  receipt of any
notice by the  Administrative  Agent of such outstanding  amount, the Company or
any of the Banks, as the case may be, shall notify the  Administrative  Agent to
the contrary.

               (b) Each  determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
Agent  pursuant to any  provision  of this  Agreement  shall be  conclusive  and
binding on the  Company in the  absence of manifest  error.  The  Administrative
Agent shall,  at the request of the Company,  deliver to the Company a statement
showing the  quotations  used by the  Administrative  Agent in  determining  any
interest rate pursuant to Section 2.4(a).

         4.6. Inability to Determine Interest Rate. In the event that the
              --------- -- --------- -------- ----
Administrative  Agent  shall  have  determined  (which  determination  shall  be
conclusive and binding upon the Company)  that,  (i) by reason of  circumstances
affecting the Eurocurrency  Interbank Markets,  adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate applicable  pursuant to Section
2.4(a) for any  requested  Interest  Period with respect to a proposed Loan that
the Company has  requested be made as a  Eurocurrency  Loan, or (ii) deposits of
Dollars or the relevant Optional Currency,  as the case may be, for the relevant
Interest  Period are not available to the  Administrative  Agent or the Banks in
any Eurocurrency  Interbank Market, or (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate determined or
to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect

                                       22
<PAGE>


the cost to the Banks of making or maintaining their  Eurocurrency  Loans during
such period,  then the  Administrative  Agent shall forthwith give notice to the
Company  and the  Banks  (by  telex,  telecopy  or  other  confirmed  electronic
communication) of such  determination,  which shall be conclusive and binding on
the  Company  and the Banks.  In such event (a) any Loan  Request or  Conversion
Request with respect to Eurocurrency Loans shall be automatically withdrawn and,
in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, shall be deemed a request for Prime
Rate Loans; (b) each  Eurocurrency Loan will  automatically,  on the last day of
the then current  Interest Period relating  thereto,  if denominated in Dollars,
become a Prime  Rate Loan and,  if  denominated  in any  Optional  Currency,  be
repaid;  and (c) the  obligations of the Banks to make  Eurocurrency  Loans,  or
Eurocurrency  Loans  denominated in such Optional Currency (as the case may be),
shall  be  suspended  until  the  Administrative  Agent  or the  Majority  Banks
determines  that the  circumstances  giving  rise to such  suspension  no longer
exist,  whereupon  the  Administrative  Agent  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  the
Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Majority Banks, shall so notify
the Company and the Banks.

         4.7. Overdue Amounts; Interest During Default.
              ------- -------  -------- ------ --------

               (a)  (i)  Overdue  principal  of any  Loan  and  (to  the  extent
permitted by law) overdue  interest on the Loans and all other  overdue  amounts
payable  hereunder  shall, and (ii) during the continuance of a Default or Event
of  Default  and  until  the same has been  cured or  remedied  or waived by the
requisite  Banks pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof,  the principal of any Loan not
overdue shall,  without  limiting any rights of the  Administrative  Agent under
Section 9, bear  interest  at a rate per annum  which is 2% above the Prime Rate
until paid in full (after as well as before judgment).

               (b)  Interest  on each Loan  shall be  payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date with respect thereto and after the occurrence of any Event
of Default, shall be payable upon demand.

         4.8. Payments. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the
              --------
Company on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without set off
or counterclaim,  shall be made to the Administrative  Agent for the accounts of
the Banks at the Administrative Agent's office set forth in Section 12.2 in Same
Day Funds, and shall be paid, if in respect of any Eurocurrency Loan denominated
in an Optional Currency, in the same currency,  and otherwise in lawful money of
the United States of America.  If any payment  hereunder (other than payments on
the  Eurocurrency  Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business
Day,  such payment  shall be extended to the next  succeeding  Business Day and,
with respect to payments of principal,  interest thereon shall be payable at the
Prime Rate. If any payment on a  Eurocurrency  Loan becomes due and payable on a
day other than a Business  Day,  the maturity  thereof  shall be extended to the
next  succeeding  Business Day unless the result of such  extension  would be to
extend such  payment  into  another  calendar  month in which event such payment
shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

         4.9. Foreign Taxes. All payments made by the Company under this
              -------------
Agreement  shall be made free and  clear of,  and  without  reduction  for or on
account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts,
duties,  charges,  fees,  deductions or withholdings,  now or hereafter imposed,
levied, collected,  withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority excluding
income  and  franchise  taxes of the United  States of America or any  political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein  (including Puerto Rico), and
the country in which the Administrative  Agent's  Eurocurrency Lending Office is
located or any  political  subdivision  or taxing  authority  thereof or therein
(such  non-excluded  taxes being herein called "Foreign Taxes").  If any Foreign
Taxes  are  required  to be  withheld  from any  amounts  payable  to the  Banks
hereunder  or under the Notes,  the  amounts  so  payable to the Banks  shall be
increased to the extent  necessary  to yield to the Banks (after  payment of all
Foreign Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates
or in the  amounts  specified  in this  Agreement  and the Notes.  Whenever  any
Foreign Tax is payable by the Company, as promptly as possible  thereafter,  the
Company shall send to the  Administrative  Agent a certified copy of an original
official  receipt  showing  payment  thereof.  If the  Company  fails to pay any
Foreign Taxes when due to the appropriate  taxing authority or fails to remit to
the  Administrative  Agent the required  receipts or other required  documentary
evidence, the Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Banks for
any  incremental  taxes,  interest or penalties  that may become  payable by the
Banks as a result of any such failure.

         4.10. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, (i) if
               ----------
any  Requirement of Law enacted after the date hereof,  or (ii) if any change in
the  interpretation or application of any Requirement of Law as in effect on the
date  hereof,  shall  make it  unlawful  for  the  Banks  to  make  or  maintain
Eurocurrency Loans, or to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loans denominated in
an Optional Currency, as contemplated by this Agreement, then as applicable: (a)
the  Commitment  to  make  Eurocurrency  Loans,  or as the  case  may be to make
Eurocurrency  Loans  denominated in such Optional  Currency,  shall forthwith be
cancelled,  (b) the Loans then outstanding as Eurocurrency  Loans denominated in
Dollars,  if any,  shall  be  repaid  on the  last  day of the  Interest  Period
therefor,  or within such earlier  period as required by law, and  reborrowed as
Prime  Rate  Loans,  and  (c)  the  Eurocurrency   Loans  then  outstanding  and
denominated in such Optional  Currency,  if any, shall be repaid on the last day
of each Interest  Period  applicable to such  Eurocurrency  Loans or within such
earlier  period  as  may  be  required  by  law.  If any  such  prepayment  of a
Eurocurrency  Loan is made on a day  which is not the  last day of the  Interest
Period  therefor,  the  Company  shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the
accounts  of the Banks such  amounts,  if any,  as may be  required  pursuant to
Section 4.11.

         4.11. Additional Costs, Etc.
               ---------- ------ ----

               (a)  In the  event  that  any  Requirement  of Law or any  change
therein or in the  interpretation  or  application  thereof or compliance by any
Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from
any   central   bank  or  other   Governmental   Authority   or  any  agency  or
instrumentality thereof:

                  (i)  does or  shall  subject  any  Bank to any tax of any kind
whatsoever  other than taxes  imposed  on or  measured  by the net income or any
franchise  taxes  imposed in lieu of a tax on or  measured by net income of such
Bank or any Participant (such non-excluded  items being hereinafter  referred to
as  "Taxes")  with  respect  to this  Agreement,  the  Notes or any  Loans  made
hereunder,  or  changes  the  basis of  taxation  of  payments  to such  Bank of
principal, Facility Fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder (except
for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank);

                  (ii)  does or shall  impose,  modify  or hold  applicable  any
reserve, special deposit,  compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, or deposits or other  liabilities in or for the account of, advances or
loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any
office of such Bank which are not otherwise included in the determination of the
Eurocurrency Rate; or

                  (iii) does or shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is, in respect of Eurocurrency  Loans, to
increase  the cost to such Bank of  making,  renewing  or  maintaining  Loans or
extensions  of credit  hereunder or to reduce any amount  receivable  hereunder,
then the Company shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of such Bank, upon demand,  any additional  amounts necessary to compensate such
Bank for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such Bank deems
to be  material as  determined  by such Bank with  respect to such  Eurocurrency
Loans. If such Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to
this subsection,  it shall promptly notify the  Administrative  Agent which will
promptly notify the Company of the event by reason of which such Bank has become
so entitled.  A statement as to any additional  amounts payable  pursuant to the
foregoing sentence submitted by the Administrative Agent to the Company shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest  error.  This  covenant  shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and payment of the Notes.

                                       24
<PAGE>

               (b)  If  any   change   in,   or  the   introduction,   adoption,
effectiveness,  interpretation,  reinterpretation  or  phase-in  of,  any law or
regulation, directive, guideline, decision or request (whether or not having the
force of law) of any  court,  central  bank,  regulator  or  other  Governmental
Authority  affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to
be maintained by any Bank or any corporation controlling any Bank, and such Bank
determines (in its sole and absolute discretion) that the rate of return on such
Bank's  or  such  controlling  corporation's  capital  as a  consequence  of its
obligation  hereunder  is reduced to a level  below that which such Bank or such
controlling  corporation  could have achieved but for the occurrence of any such
circumstance,  then, in any such case,  upon the notice from time to time by the
Administrative  Agent or such Bank to the Company,  the Company shall pay to the
Administrative  Agent,  for the account of such Bank, on demand,  any additional
amount  or  amounts  as may be  sufficient  to  compensate  such  Bank  or  such
controlling corporation for such reduction in rate of return. A statement of the
Administrative  Agent or such Bank as to any such  additional  amount or amounts
(including  calculations  thereof in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
manifest  error, be conclusive and binding on the Company.  In determining  such
amount or amounts,  such Bank may use any method of  averaging  and  attribution
that it (in its  sole and  absolute  discretion)  shall  deem  applicable.  This
covenant  shall  survive the  termination  of this  Agreement and payment of the
Notes.

               (c) Any Foreign Recipient,  no later than the date of the initial
Loan (or the date of assignment or transfer, as the case may be) and, subject to
clause (e) below, annually (or at such other times as the Company may reasonably
request)  thereafter,  shall timely  deliver two  accurate  and complete  signed
originals of either of Internal  Revenue  W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any  successor of
such  form)  to the  Company  (or in the  case of a  Participant  which  holds a
participation interest which it acquired from any Bank, to such Bank which shall
provide  copies  thereof to the Company),  in either case,  indicating  that all
payments  by the Company of  principal  of, and  interest  on, the Loans and all
other amounts payable  hereunder to such Foreign  Recipient may be made free and
clear of, and without  deduction  for,  any United  States  withholding  tax. In
addition,  if required  under statute,  treaty,  regulation,  or  administrative
practice of the United States,  the Foreign Recipient that is claiming exemption
from U.S.  withholding  tax under a treaty  agrees to provide the  Company  with
proof of tax  residence  in the  applicable  country by  providing  a  certified
taxpayer  identification  number  (TIN),  a  certificate  of  residence or other
documentary evidence. The obligation to deliver forms set forth in the preceding
sentence  shall not  apply  for any  period  during  which any  change in law or
circumstance  shall  have  eliminated  any and all  obligations  imposed  on the
Company  to  withhold  or deduct  United  States  withholding  tax in respect of
payments made by the Company hereunder;  provided that the Foreign Recipient has
complied with all requirements,  if any, imposed by statute, treaty,  regulation
or  administrative  practice of the United  States  necessary to eliminate  such
obligation to withhold by the Company.

               (d) The  Company  shall  not be  required  to pay any  additional
amounts  to a Foreign  Recipient  in respect of United  States  withholding  tax
pursuant to Section  4.09 or this  Section  4.11 if the  obligation  to pay such
additional  amounts  would not have  arisen  but for a failure  by such  Foreign
Recipient  to comply  with the  provisions  of  Section  4.11(c)  for any reason
(including a change in circumstances  that renders such Foreign Recipient unable
to so comply) other than (x) a change in applicable law,  regulation or official
interpretation  thereof or (y) an amendment,  modification  or revocation of any
applicable tax treaty or a change in official position regarding the application
or interpretation  thereof,  in each case after the date hereof (and in the case
of a  Participant,  after  the date of  assignment  or  transfer).  In no event,
however,  will  the  Company  be  required  to  pay  additional  amounts  if any
obligation  to pay such  additional  amounts  would not have  arisen but for the
failure of the Foreign Recipient to comply with any requirement under a statute,
treaty,  regulations,  or  administrative  practice  of  the  United  States  to
establish  exemption  from  all or part  of the  tax in  respect  of  which  the
additional amount would otherwise be paid.

<PAGE>

               (e) If, solely as a result of an event described in clause (x) or
(y) of Section 4.11(d), after the date hereof (or, in the case of a Participant,
after the date of assignment or transfer),  (i) any Foreign  Recipient is unable
to furnish the Company  with a form  otherwise  required to be  delivered  by it
pursuant to Section 4.11(c), or (ii) any Bank or any Foreign Recipient makes any
payment or  becomes  liable to make any  payment on account of any Taxes,  other
than a United  States  withholding  tax, with respect to payments by the Company
hereunder,  the Company may, at its option,  either (x) prepay the Loans held by
such Bank (or such Foreign  Recipient)  or (y) continue to make  payments to the
Administrative  Agent on behalf of such Bank or such Foreign Recipient under the
terms  of  this  Agreement  and  the  Notes,  which  payments  shall  be made in
accordance  with the  provisions  hereof if the  condition set forth in the next
succeeding  sentence is  satisfied.  If the Company  exercises  its option under
clause (y) of the preceding sentence,  the Company's obligation to make payments
to the  Administrative  Agent on behalf of such Bank (or such Foreign Recipient)
under the terms of this  Agreement  and the Notes  without  deduction  for Taxes
shall be conditioned on such Bank (or such Foreign Recipient), prior to the time
that the next payment  under the Notes is due (and  thereafter as is required by
applicable  law),  having  furnished the Company with such certificate as may be
required,  and having taken such other steps as  reasonably  may be available to
it, under  applicable  tax laws and any  applicable  tax treaty or convention to
obtain an exemption from, or reduction (to the lowest  applicable rate) of, such
Taxes.

         4.12. Indemnity. The Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and to hold
               ---------
each Bank harmless from and against any loss,  cost or expense or loss of margin
that such Bank may  sustain  or incur as a  consequence  of (i)  default  by the
Company  in  payment  of  the  principal  amount  of  or  any  interest  on  any
Eurocurrency  Loans as and  when due and  payable,  including  any such  loss or
expense  arising from  interest or fees payable by such Bank to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to maintain its Eurocurrency  Loans, (ii) default by the
Company in making a borrowing or  conversion  after the Company has given (or is
deemed to have given) a Loan Request or Conversion  Request in  accordance  with
Sections  2.3 and 2.6  hereof,  (iii)  default  by the  Company  in  making  any
prepayment  of a Loan after the  Company has given a notice in  accordance  with
Section  2.9 hereof or (iv) the making of any  payment  of a  Eurocurrency  Loan
(including,  without limitation, any prepayment made as a result of action taken
under  Section  4.10 or as a result of the  Administrative  Agent's  exercise of
rights  under  Section  9  hereof)  on a day  that  is not the  last  day of the
applicable Interest Period with respect thereto, or the making of any payment on
a Swing Line Loan on a day other than the maturity date  thereof,  including (in
the case of either such Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Line Loan payments)  interest
or fees  payable  by such Bank to lenders  of funds  obtained  by it in order to
maintain  any such  Loans.  This  covenant  shall  survive  termination  of this
Agreement and payment of the Notes.

adverse  effect on the  business,  operations,  property or  financial  or other

         SECTION 10.  THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
                      ------------------------

         10.1. Authorization.
               --------------

               (a) Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Fleet as
the  Administrative  Agent under this Agreement and  irrevocably  authorizes the
Administrative  Agent to take such action on its behalf under the  provisions of
this  Agreement  and to  exercise  such  powers and  perform  such duties as are
expressly  delegated to said agents by the terms of this Agreement together with
such other powers as are reasonably incident thereto, provided that no duties or
responsibilities  not  expressly  assumed  herein or therein shall be implied to
have been assumed by said agents.

               (b) The relationship between the Administrative Agent and each of
the Banks is that of an independent contractor.  The use of the term " Agent" is
for  convenience  only and is used to  describe,  as a form of  convention,  the
independent contractual relationship between the Administrative Agent, acting in
such capacity,  and each of the Banks. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be  construed  to  create  an  agency  (except  to the  extent  of the  specific
contractual  obligations of the Administrative Agent hereunder),  trust or other
fiduciary relationship between the Administrative Agent and any of the Banks.

               (c) The Syndication Agent shall have no duties,  responsibilities
or  obligations  to, nor authority to act for, any other party to this Agreement
by virtue of its status as Syndication Agent hereunder.

         10.2. Employees and Administrative Agents. The Administrative Agent may
               --------- --- -------------- ------
exercise  its  powers  and  execute  its  duties  by  or  through  employees  or
Administrative  Agents and shall be entitled to take,  and to rely on, advice of
counsel  concerning  all matters  pertaining to its rights and duties under this
Agreement.  The Administrative Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as
the Administrative  Agent in its sole discretion may reasonably  determine,  and
all  reasonable  fees  and  expenses  of any such  Persons  shall be paid by the
Company.

         10.3. No Liability. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
               -- ---------
shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting it
in its duties nor any Administrative Agent or employee thereof,  shall be liable
for any waiver,  consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be
taken, in good faith by it or them hereunder,  or in connection herewith,  or be
responsible  for  the  consequences  of  any  oversight  or  error  of  judgment
whatsoever,  except that the  Administrative  Agent or such other Person, as the
case may be, may be liable for losses  due to its  willful  misconduct  or gross
negligence.

         10.4. No Representations. The Administrative Agent shall not be
               -- ---------------
responsible for the execution or validity or  enforceability  of this Agreement,
the Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made
herein or in any  certificate or instrument  hereafter  furnished to it by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or be bound to  ascertain or
inquire as to the  performance  or observance  of any of the terms,  conditions,
covenants or agreements  herein or in any books or records of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.  The  Administrative  Agent shall not be bound to ascertain
whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to it by the Company or
any  holder of any of the Notes  shall  have  been duly  authorized  or is true,
accurate and  complete.  The  Administrative  Agent has not made nor does it now
make any representations or warranties,  express or implied,  nor does it assume
any liability to the Banks,  with respect to the credit  worthiness or financial
conditions  of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries.  Each Bank  acknowledges
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or
any other Bank, and based upon such  information  and documents as it has deemed
appropriate,  made its own  credit  analysis  and  decision  to enter  into this
Agreement.

         10.5. Payments.
               --------

                  (a) Payments to Administrative Agent. A payment by the Company
                      -------- -- -------------- -----
to the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  for  the  account  of any  Bank  shall
constitute a payment to such Bank. The  Administrative  Agent agrees promptly to
distribute  to each Bank such Bank's pro rata share of payments  received by the
Administrative  Agent for the account of the Banks except as otherwise expressly
provided herein.

                  (b) Distribution by Administrative Agent. If in the opinion of
                      ------------ -- -------------- -----
the  Administrative  Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in such
capacity  hereunder  or under the Notes might  involve it in  liability,  it may
refrain from making distribution until its right to make distribution shall have
been adjudicated by a court of competent  jurisdiction.  If a court of competent
jurisdiction  shall  adjudge  that any amount  received and  distributed  by the
Administrative  Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any such distribution
shall  have  been  made  shall  either  repay to the  Administrative  Agent  its
proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the
same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.

                  (c) Delinquent Banks. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
                      ---------- -----
contained  in this  Agreement,  any Bank  that  fails to make  available  to the
Administrative  Agent its pro rata share of any Loan, or fails to make available
to the Swing Line Bank its pro rata  share of any Swing  Line Loan,  when and to
the full extent required by the provisions of this Agreement,  shall be deemed a
Delinquent  Bank and shall be deemed a  Delinquent  Bank until such time as such
delinquency is satisfied. A Delinquent Bank shall be deemed to have assigned any
and all payments due to it from the Company to the remaining nondelinquent Banks
for  application  to, and reduction of, their  respective pro rata shares of all
outstanding  Loans.  The Delinquent  Bank hereby  authorizes the  Administrative
Agent to distribute  such payments to the  nondelinquent  Banks in proportion to
their  respective pro rata shares of all  outstanding  Loans. A Delinquent  Bank
shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency when and if, as a result
of  application  of the  assigned  payments  to  all  outstanding  Loans  of the
nondelinquent  Banks,  the Banks'  respective pro rata shares of all outstanding
Loans have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and
without giving effect to the nonpayment causing such delinquency.

<PAGE>


         10.6. Holders of Notes. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
               ------- -- -----
payee of any Note as the absolute  owner or  purchaser  thereof for all purposes
hereof until it shall have been  furnished  in writing with a different  name by
such payee or by a subsequent holder, assignee or transferee.

         10.7. Indemnity. The Banks ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold
               ---------
harmless the Administrative  Agent from and against any and all claims,  actions
and suits (whether groundless or otherwise),  losses,  damages,  costs, expenses
(including without limitation,  any expenses for which the Administrative  Agent
has not been reimbursed by the Company as required by Section 12.5 hereof),  and
liabilities  of every  nature and  character  arising  out of or related to this
Agreement,  the Notes, or the transactions  contemplated or evidenced hereby, or
the  Administrative  Agent's actions taken hereunder,  except to the extent that
any of the same shall be caused by the Administrative Agent's willful misconduct
or gross negligence.

         10.8. Administrative Agent as Bank. In its individual capacity, Fleet
               -------------- ----- -- ----
shall have the same  obligations  and the same rights,  powers and privileges in
respect to its  Commitment and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of
the Notes, as it would have were it not also the Administrative Agent.

         10.9. Resignation. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
               -----------
giving  sixty  (60)  days  prior  written  notice  thereof  to the Banks and the
Company.  Upon any such resignation,  the Majority Banks shall have the right to
appoint a successor  Administrative  Agent. Unless a Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, such successor Administrative Agent shall
be reasonably  acceptable to the Company. If no successor  Administrative  Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Majority  Banks and shall have accepted such
appointment  within thirty (30) days after the retiring  Administrative  Agent's
giving of notice of resignation,  then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor  Administrative Agent, which shall be a
financial  institution  having a rating of not less than A or its  equivalent by
Standard & Poor's  Rating  Group.  Upon the  acceptance  of any  appointment  as
Administrative  Agent  hereunder  by  a  successor  Administrative  Agent,  such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all the rights,  powers,  privileges  and duties of the retiring  Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and   obligations   hereunder.   After  any  retiring   Administrative   Agent's
resignation,  the provisions of this Agreement  shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect  of any  actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as Administrative Agent.

         10.10. Notification of Defaults and Events of Default. Each Bank hereby
                ------------ -- -------- --- ------ -- -------
agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event of Default,
it shall promptly notify the  Administrative  Agent thereof.  The Administrative
Agent hereby  agrees that upon receipt of any notice under this Section it shall
promptly  notify the other Banks of the  existence  of such  Default or Event of
Default.

public other than through a violation of this Section 11.6, or becomes available
to any of the Banks or the Administrative Agent on a nonconfidential  basis from
a source other than the Company;  (ii) to the extent required by statute,  rule,
regulation,  or judicial or other legal process (including without limitation by
Section 1.6011-4T(a)(3), or any successor provision, of the Treasury Regulations

however, that the confidentiality  covenants under this Section 11.6 shall apply
to any and all items of  information  not required to be freely  disclosable  in
order  for any such  transaction  under  this  Agreement  not to be  treated  as
"offered  under  conditions  of  confidentiality"  within  the  meaning  of  the
Confidentiality  Regulation);  (iii)  to  counsel  for any of the  Banks  or the

bound by the provisions of or provisions  substantially  similar to this Section
11.6; or (ix) with the consent of the Company.

               (b) Unless  specifically  prohibited by  applicable  law or court
order, each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent shall, prior to disclosure
thereof, notify the Company of any request for disclosure of any such non-public

litigation, proceeding or dispute whether arising hereunder or otherwise, in any
way related to any Bank's or the  Administrative  Agent's  relationship with the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries.  The  agreements in this  subsection  shall
survive repayment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         12.6. Indemnification. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
               ---------------
harmless  the  Administrative  Agent and the Banks from and  against any and all
claims, actions and suits whether groundless or otherwise,  and from and against
any and all  liabilities,  losses,  damages  and  expenses  of every  nature and
character arising out of this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby
including,  without limitation, (i) any actual or proposed use by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of any of the Loans, (ii) the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries entering into or performing this Agreement or any of the

wrongful death, personal injury or damage to property),  in each case including,
without  limitation,  the  reasonable  fees and  disbursements  of  counsel  and
allocated  costs  of  internal  counsel  incurred  in  connection  with any such
investigation, litigation or other proceeding. The Company shall have control of
any such  litigation and the Company shall pay the reasonable  fees and expenses
of one counsel to be selected jointly by the Administrative Agent and the Banks,
which  counsel shall be  reasonably  acceptable  to the Company.  If, and to the
extent  that  the   obligations  of  the  Company  under  this   subsection  are
unenforceable  for any  reason,  the Company  hereby  agrees to make the maximum
contribution  to the  payment  in  satisfaction  of such  obligations  which  is
permissible  under  applicable  law. The  agreements  in this  subsection  shall
survive repayment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         12.7. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
               ---------- --- -------
inure to the benefit of the Company,  the  Administrative  Agent, the Banks, all
future holders of the Notes and their respective successors and assigns,  except
that the  Company  may not  assign or  transfer  any of its  rights  under  this
Agreement without the prior written consent of each of the Banks.

         12.8. Set-off. In addition to any rights or remedies of the Banks
               -------
provided by law,  each Bank shall have the right,  without  prior  notice to the
Company,  any such notice  being  expressly  waived by the Company to the extent
permitted by applicable law, upon the  acceleration of obligations  under and in
respect of this  Agreement and the Notes pursuant to Section 10, the filing of a
petition under any of the provisions of the federal bankruptcy act or amendments
thereto, by or against the Company,  the making of an assignment for the benefit

                                       49

<PAGE>


of creditors by the Company, the application for the appointment,  or the actual
appointment,  of any receiver of the  Company,  or of any of the property of the
Company,  the  issuance  of any  execution  against  any of the  property of the
Company,  the  issuance of a subpoena or order,  in  supplementary  proceedings,
against or with respect to any of the  property of the Company,  or the issuance
of a warrant of  attachment  against  any of the  property  of the  Company,  to
set-off and apply against any indebtedness,  whether matured or unmatured of the
Company to such Bank,  any amount  owing from such Bank to the Company at, or at
any time after,  the  happening of any of the above  mentioned  events,  and the
aforesaid  right of set-off may be exercised by such Bank against the Company or
against  any  trustee in  bankruptcy,  debtor in  possession,  assignee  for the
benefit of creditors,  receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of
the Company,  the Company or such trustee in  bankruptcy,  debtor in possession,
assignee  for the  benefit of  creditors,  receiver  or  execution,  judgment or
attachment  creditor,  notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall
not have been exercised by such Bank prior to the making, filing or issuance, or
service upon such Bank (either directly or through the Administrative Agent) of,
or of notice of, any such  petition;  assignment  for the benefit of  creditors;
appointment or  application  for the  appointment of a receiver;  or issuance of
execution,  subpoena,  order or warrant. Such Bank agrees promptly to notify the
Company and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made
by the Bank,  provided,  that,  the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the  validity of such set-off and  application.  Each Bank agrees with the other
Banks that (i) if an amount to be set off is to be applied  to  Indebtedness  of
the Company to a Bank, other than Indebtedness evidenced by the then outstanding
Notes held by all of the Banks,  such  amount  shall be applied  ratably to such
other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness evidenced by all such Notes, and (ii)
if a Bank shall receive from the Company, whether by voluntary payment, exercise
of the right of set-off,  counterclaim,  cross action,  enforcement of the claim
evidenced by the Notes held by a Bank by  proceeding  against the Company at law
or in equity or by proof  thereof in  bankruptcy,  reorganization,  liquidation,
receivership or similar proceedings, or otherwise, and shall retain and apply to
the  payment  of the Note or Notes  held by a Bank any  amount  in excess of its
ratable  portion of the  payments  received by all of the Banks,  such Bank will
make such disposition and arrangements with the other Banks with respect to such
excess,  either  by  way  of  distribution,  pro  tanto  assignment  of  claims,
subrogation  or otherwise  as shall result in each Bank  receiving in respect of
the  Notes  held  by it  its  proportionate  payment  as  contemplated  by  this
Agreement;  provided, however, that if all or any part of such excess payment is
thereafter  recovered from such Bank, such disposition and arrangements shall be
rescinded and the amount  restored to the extent of such  recovery,  but without
interest.

         12.9. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate in the event (I) Ian
               -----------
Cumming and Joseph Steinberg cease to own,  directly or indirectly,  32% or more
of the Voting  Stock of the  Company,  provided,  that  Messrs.  Cumming  and/or
Steinberg may cease to own,  directly or  indirectly,  32% or more of the Voting
Stock of the Company if: (a) in the aggregate, they own, directly or indirectly,
at least 23% of the outstanding  Voting Stock, and (b)(i) if during the lifetime
of Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg,  the aggregate Market Value of the Voting Stock
owned by them, directly or indirectly,  is at least $200,000,000 or (ii) if upon
the death of either Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg,  the aggregate Market Value of
the Voting  Stock owned,  directly or  indirectly,  by the survivor  would be at
least  $100,000,000 or (II) either Mr. Cumming or Mr.  Steinberg ceases (if as a

                                       50
<PAGE>


result of death,  effective  as  provided  below)  to be a  principal  executive
officer  (which shall  include the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors)
of the Company.  Such termination shall be immediate if it arises from any event
other than the death of either or both of Ian Cumming and Joseph  Steinberg.  If
such termination shall arise from the death of either or both of Ian Cumming and
Joseph Steinberg such  termination  shall take effect 130 days after such event.
Upon any such termination, the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the accounts of the Banks all amounts owing under this  Agreement and the Notes.
No such  termination  shall  affect any rights  acquired by the Banks under this
Agreement prior to or as a result of such termination.

          For  purposes  hereof:  (i) The term "owned,  directly or  indirectly"
shall be deemed to include all Voting  Stock  received  from Mr.  Cumming or Mr.
Steinberg by any member of their respective  immediate  families or by any trust
for the  benefit of either of them or any member of their  respective  immediate
families (a  "Recipient"),  which Voting Stock is held by a Recipient during the
lifetime  of  Mr.  Cumming  or Mr.  Steinberg.  In  determining  the  number  of
outstanding  Common  Shares then held by Messrs.  Cumming and  Steinberg and the
total number of outstanding Common Shares, there shall be excluded Common Shares
issued by the  Company  after  December  31,  1991,  or the  conversion  into or
exchange for, after December 31, 1991,  Common Shares or securities  convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Shares. (ii) The term "Market Price" shall mean,
with reference to the Company's Common Shares ("Common  Shares") for any Trading
Day, the last  reported sale price of a Common Share as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange or on any principal stock exchange on which the Common Shares are
then listed or admitted to trading or on the National  Association of Securities
Dealers National Market System, if quoted; or, if the Common Shares are not then
listed or admitted to trading on any national  securities  exchange and there is
no reported  last sale price or bid and asked prices  available,  the average of
the  reported  high-bid  and  low-asked  prices  on such  day as  reported  by a
reputable quotation service or a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough
of Manhattan, City and State of New York, customarily published on each business
day; or, in the absence of one or more such quotations, the current market price
determined  in good faith by the Board of  Directors of the Company on the basis
of such  quotations or factors as it deems  appropriate.  (iii) The term "Market
Value" shall mean,  with reference to the Company's  Common Shares,  the average
Market  Price of such  Common  Shares for the twenty  Trading  Days  immediately
preceding the date of the sale,  transfer or disposition giving rise to the need
to determine Market Value.
