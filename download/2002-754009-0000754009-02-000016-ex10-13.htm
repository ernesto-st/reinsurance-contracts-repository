     1.2 Sierra  agrees to make all payments due under the Note through the date
of the arbitration award.

     1.3 Kaiser  agrees to deposit  into an  interest  bearing  escrow an amount
equivalent  to each payment  Sierra makes  pursuant to Section 1.2.  This is not
intended to constitute a modification of the Loan Documents.

     1.4 In the event that Sierra fails to make any of the payments  required by

decision  will be in  favor of  Kaiser;  if the  decision  is that SHS is not so
liable, the decision is in favor of SHS. Arbitration will be based solely on the
rights and  obligations  of the  parties  under the  documents  executed  by the

               does not  know or  suspect  to exist in his  favor at the time of
               executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
               affected his settlement with the debtor.

The Parties hereby  acknowledge  that the foregoing  waiver of the provisions of
Section 1542 of the  California  Civil Code was  separately  bargained  for. The
Parties expressly consent that this release shall be given full force and effect
in  accordance  with each and all of its  provisions  relating  to  unknown  and
unsuspected claims,  demands and causes of action, if any, to the same effect as
those terms and provisions  relating to any other claims,  demands and causes of
action hereinabove specified.


     2.8 Released  Claims Not Previously  Assigned.  The Parties  represent that
they have the full and  complete  authority  to provide the  releases  set forth

of the  rights  of  claims  released  by this  Settlement  Agreement,  except as
provided in Section 3.2, below.


     2.9  Limitation  Of  Liability.  The Parties agree that no claim or payment
pursuant to this  Settlement  Agreement  shall be included in the minimum dollar
limitations set forth in Section 11.3 of the Purchase  Agreement.  However,  the
payment  of  $2.5  million  ($2,500,000.00)  pursuant  to  Section  1.1 of  this
Settlement  Agreement,  and the payment of Four Million Ninety-two Thousand Four
Hundred Ninety-three  Dollars and twenty-one cents  ($4,092,493.21) by Kaiser to
Sierra in April,  2000, shall be aggregated and will be treated as an "aggregate

Agreement.

singular shall be deemed to include the plural and the plural shall be deemed to
include the singular, and the masculine,  feminine and neater genders shall each
be deemed to include the other.

     3.10 No Reliance.  Except for representations expressly stated herein, none
of  the  Parties  are  entering  into  this   Agreement  in  reliance  upon  the
representation of the other parties.

     3.11  Independent  Advice Of Counsel.  Each of the Parties  represents  and
declares that in executing this  Settlement  Agreement it has relied solely upon
its own judgment,  belief and knowledge,  and the advice and  recommendations of
its own  independently  selected  counsel,  concerning  the  nature,  extent and
duration of its rights and claims,  and that it has not been  influenced  to any
extent  whatsoever  in executing the same by any  representations  or statements
covering  any  matters  made  by the  other  Parties  hereto  or by  any  person
representing the other Parties.

     3.12 Voluntary Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto further represents and
declares  that it has  carefully  read this  Settlement  Agreement and knows its
contents and that each of the Parties signs the same freely and voluntarily.

     3.15  Prohibition  Against  Assignment  Without  Consent.  The  rights  and
obligations  created  under  this  Settlement   Agreement  are  not  subject  to
assignment or transfer without the express written consent of the Sierra Parties
and the Kaiser  Parties,  each of whom may grant or withhold such consent in its
sole and exclusive  discretion.  Any assignment in violation of this prohibition
shall  not  release  the  assignor  from any  liability  under  this  Settlement
Agreement and shall additionally make the assignor unconditionally,  jointly and
severally liable for the acts of the assignee.

     3.16  Exoneration Of Fraud Claims.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of
this Settlement  Agreement,  Sierra agrees to make a public statement concerning
this settlement which states, in substance, the following:

                    Sierra  is  pleased  to  announce  that it has  settled  its
                    lawsuit against Kaiser Permanente concerning the acquisition
                    of  certain of its  assets  located  in and  around  Dallas,
                    Texas.  In that  lawsuit,  Sierra  had  alleged  that it was
                    defrauded  by  Kaiser  Permanente.  In  the  course  of  the
                    parties'  subsequent  discussions  aimed  at  resolving  the
                    lawsuit,  it became apparent that, while there were a number
                    of misunderstandings  and disagreements between the parties,
                    none of the conduct  amounted to fraud,  and Sierra does not
                    believe that it was  defrauded by Kaiser  Permanente  or the
                    other individuals who were named as defendants.

     3.17 Arbitration.

     (a)  Conciliation  And  Mediation.  If a dispute  between Kaiser and Sierra
relating to this Settlement Agreement (other than the dispute being submitted to
arbitration  under Section 1 of this Settlement  Agreement),  or under any other
agreement executed and delivered in connection herewith,  is not resolved within
fifteen  (15) days from the date that either  party has  notified the other that
such  dispute  exists,   then  such  dispute  shall  be  submitted  jointly  for
conciliation  to the  president  or his  designee of each party.  If such senior
executive  officers  are unable to resolve the dispute  within  thirty (30) days
from the date that it is first  presented to them,  either party may give notice
to the other party that the dispute shall be submitted to non-binding  mediation
with a mediator  acceptable to both parties,  and the parties shall, for a sixty
(60) day period from the receipt of such  notice,  seek in good faith to resolve
such dispute in mediation. If the parties are not able to resolve the dispute in
mediation, then such dispute shall be referred to binding arbitration.

     (b)  Arbitration.  Any dispute  submitted to  arbitration  pursuant to this
Section shall be determined by the decision of a board of arbitration consisting
of three members  ("Board of  Arbitration")  selected as  hereinafter  provided.
Kaiser shall select an arbitrator and Sierra shall select an arbitrator, each of
whom shall be a member of the Board of  Arbitration  who is  independent  of the
parties. A third Board of Arbitration member,  independent of the parties, shall
be selected by mutual  agreement of the other two Board of Arbitration  members.
If the other two Board of  Arbitration  members fail to reach  agreement on such
third member  within twenty (20) days after their  selection,  such third member
shall  thereafter  be  selected by the  American  Arbitration  Association  upon
application  made to it for such  purpose by any party to the  arbitration.  The
Board of  Arbitration  shall meet in  Dallas,  Texas,  or such other  place as a
majority of the members of the Board of Arbitration determines more appropriate,
and shall reach and render a decision in writing  (which shall state the reasons
for its decisions in writing and shall make such decisions entirely on the basis
of the  substantive  law governing the Agreement and which shall be concurred in
by a majority of the members of the Board of  Arbitration)  with  respect to the
items in dispute.  In  connection  with  rendering its  decisions,  the Board of
Arbitration  shall adopt and follow the  Commercial  Rules of Arbitration of the
American  Arbitration  Association in effect as of the date of the  arbitration,
except as provided in Exhibit B. To the extent practical, decisions of the Board
of  Arbitration  shall be  rendered  no more  than  thirty  (30)  calendar  days
following  commencement  of  proceedings  with  respect  thereto.  The  Board of
Arbitration  shall  cause its  written  decision  to be  delivered  to Buyer and
Seller. Any decision made by the Board of Arbitration  (either prior to or after
the  expiration  of such 30  calendar  day period)  shall be final,  binding and
conclusive on Buyer and Seller (except as may be provided in Exhibit B) and each
party to the  arbitration  shall be  entitled  to enforce  such  decision to the
fullest  extent  permitted  by  law  and  entered  in  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction.  The  fees  and  expenses  of the  Board  of  Arbitration  and the
reasonable  fees and expenses of legal  counsel and  consultants  of the parties
shall  be  allocated  among  the  Parties  as the  Board  of  Arbitration  deems
appropriate.

     (c)  Judicial  Relief.  The Parties  expressly  agree that  nothing in this
arbitration  agreement will prevent,  impair,  or in any way prejudice  Kaiser's
rights to seek preliminary  injunctive  relief and/or other judicial relief with
respect to any action for judicial or non-judicial  foreclosure  with respect to
the Real Estate.

     (d) This Section 3.16 does not apply to Hohl and West.

     3.17  Attorneys'  Fees And  Costs.  In the  event  that any  proceeding  is
commenced  to enforce  the terms of this  Settlement  Agreement,  or for damages
arising therefrom,  the prevailing party in that action shall be entitled to its
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit.

     3.18   Counterparts.   This   Settlement   Agreement  may  be  executed  in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

     3.19 Notice.  Notice to the Parties with respect to any matters  referenced

                             UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTY
                             ----------------------



     THIS  UNCONDITIONAL  GUARANTY is made  effective  the 31st day of December,
2001 by the  undersigned  SIERRA  HEALTH  SERVICES,  INC., a Nevada  corporation
(hereinafter  referred to collectively as "Guarantor",  whether one or more), in
favor of KAISER  FOUNDATION  HOSPITALS,  a California  nonprofit  public benefit
corporation ("Lender").

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  for good and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,  Guarantor,  whose address is set
forth below, hereby agrees as follows:

     1.  Guarantor  unconditionally  and  absolutely  guarantees,   jointly  and
severally,  to Lender the prompt and full payment,  performance  and observance,
when due,  of all amounts  payable  under that  certain  Deed of Trust Note (the
"Original Note") dated October 31, 1998, executed by TEXAS HEALTH CHOICE,  L.C.,
a Texas limited liability company (the "Borrower"),  and payable to the order of
Kaiser  Foundation  Health Plan of Texas ("Original  Mortgagee") in the original
principal  amount of $35,200,000,  as (a) endorsed,  assigned and transferred to
Lender  pursuant to those certain  Assignment  and  Assumption of Loan Documents
dated effective December 31, 2000, executed by Original Mortgagee and Lender and
recorded in Volume 98214, Page 04429,  Records,  Dallas County,  Texas and under
Document Number D201091657,  Real Property Records, Tarrant County, Texas and (b
) amended by that  certain  Modification  of Deed of Trust Note dated  effective
December  31,  2001,  executed  by  Borrower  Lender  and  Guarantor  (the "Note
Modification")  [the  Original  Note and the Note  Modification  are referred to
collectively   as  the  "Note"]  and  any  and  all  renewals,   extensions  and
rearrangements  of  all  or  any  part  of  the  indebtedness,  obligations  and
liabilities  herein described,  whether or not Borrower is personally liable for
any such indebtedness,  liabilities,  or obligations or whether recourse or not,
whether  joint or  several,  secured  or  unsecured,  contractual  or  tortious,
liquidated or unliquidated,  arising by operation of law or otherwise, direct or
indirect,  or whether incurred by Borrower as principal,  accommodation party or
otherwise,  and  interest  on all of the above  amounts as agreed  upon  between
Borrower and Lender,  or if there is no agreement,  at the highest  lawful rate.
All indebtedness,  obligations and liabilities hereinabove described and covered
or intended to be covered by this Unconditional  Guaranty, or intended so to be,
are  hereinafter   sometimes   collectively   referred  to  as  the  "Guaranteed
Indebtedness."  Without  limiting  the  foregoing,   Guarantor  unconditionally,
irrevocably and absolutely  guarantees to Lender and to every subsequent  holder
or holders of the Note that (a) the principal of and interest on, and reasonable
attorneys'  fees  provided  for in, the Note will be  promptly  paid when due in
accordance  with the provisions  thereof or, in the case of an extension of time
of payment in whole or in part of the Note,  all sums will be promptly paid when
due in  accordance  with  the  terms of the  extension;  (b) all  covenants  and
agreements of Borrower  contained in the Note,  those certain Deeds of Trust and
Security Agreement  (collectively,  the "Deeds of Trust"),  to Edward F. Walker,
Trustee,  recorded in Volume  98214,  Page 4929 of the Deed of Trust  Records of
Dallas County,  Texas and under County Clerk's File Number  D198254090,  Deed of
Trust Records,  Tarrant County,  Texas covering certain real property  described
therein,  as amended by (I) that certain letter agreement dated October 6, 1999,
between Borrower and Original Mortgagee  regarding  condemnation of a portion of
the property located in Tarrant County, Texas covered by the Deeds of Trust, and
(II) those certain  Modification of Deed of Trust and Security  Agreements dated
effective  December  31,  2001  executed by  Borrower,  Lender,  and  Guarantor,
(collectively,  the "DOT  Modifications"),  and any  other  instrument,  whether
presently  existing  or  hereinafter  entered  into,  evidencing,   securing  or
governing the  disbursement  of the  Guaranteed  Indebtedness,  will be duly and
promptly  observed and performed and (c) all  additional  amounts owing or which
hereafter  becoming  owing by Borrower under the terms of the Note, the Deeds of
Trust, the Note Modification,  the DOT Modifications,  and any other instrument,
whether presently existing or hereinafter entered into, evidencing,  securing or
governing the  disbursement  of the Guaranteed  Indebtedness  (collectively  the
"Loan Documents") will be promptly paid when due.

     2. The  obligations  of Guarantor  shall be  performable  without demand of
Lender and shall be  unconditional  irrespective of the  genuineness,  validity,
regularity or  enforceability  of the Note,  the Deeds of Trust,  any other Loan
Documents, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge of a surety or a guarantor,  and Guarantor hereby waives the
benefit of all  principles or provisions of law,  statutory or otherwise,  which
are or might be in conflict with the terms of this Unconditional  Guaranty,  and
agrees  that  the  obligations  of  Guarantor  shall  not  be  affected  by  any
circumstances,  whether or not referred to in this Unconditional Guaranty, which
might  otherwise  constitute  a legal or  equitable  discharge  of a  surety  or
guarantor,  other  than  satisfaction  in full of the  Guaranteed  Indebtedness.
Specifically,  to the extent this Unconditional Guaranty is governed by the laws
of the  State of  Texas,  the  Guarantor  waives  the  benefits  of any right of
discharge under Article 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code and any other
rights of sureties and guarantors thereunder. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing,  the Guarantor hereby waives  diligence,  presentment,  demand of
payment,  protest, all notices (whether of nonpayment,  acceleration,  dishonor,
protest or  otherwise)  with respect to the Note,  notice of  acceptance of this
Unconditional  Guaranty  and  of  the  incurring  by  Borrower  of  any  of  the
obligations  hereinbefore mentioned,  all demands whatsoever,  and all rights to
require Lender to (a) proceed against  Borrower;  (b) proceed against or exhaust
any  collateral  held by  Lender  to  secure  the  payment  of the  indebtedness
guaranteed  hereby or (c) pursue any other remedy it may now or  hereafter  have
against Borrower.

     3. Guarantor hereby agrees that, at any time or from time to time,  without
notice to Guarantor and without  affecting  the liability of Guarantor,  (a) the
time for payment of the principal of or interest on the Guaranteed Indebtedness,
the Note may be extended or the Note may be renewed in whole or in part; (b) the
time for  Borrower's  performance  of or  compliance  with any other  instrument
evidencing,   securing  or  governing  the   disbursement   of  the   Guaranteed
Indebtedness,  whether  presently  existing or hereinafter  entered into, may be
extended or such  performance or compliance  may be waived;  (c) the maturity of
the Note may be accelerated as provided therein or in the Deeds of Trust, or any
other  instrument  evidencing,  securing or governing  the  disbursement  of the
Guaranteed Indebtedness, whether presently existing or hereinafter entered into;
(d) the Note, the Deeds of Trust, the Note Modification, DOT Modifications,  the
Loan Documents,  or any other instrument  evidencing,  securing or governing the
disbursement  of the  Guaranteed  Indebtedness,  whether  presently  existing or
hereinafter  entered into, may be modified or amended by the Lender and Borrower
in any  respect,  including,  but not limited  to, an increase in the  principal
amount and (e) any security  for the  Guaranteed  Indebtedness  may be modified,
exchanged,  surrendered  or otherwise  dealt with or additional  security may be
pledged or mortgaged for the Guaranteed Indebtedness.

     4. Guarantor hereby  acknowledges that the withdrawal from, or liquidation,
dissolution,   termination  or  restructuring  of,  any  ownership  interest  in
Borrower,  or any partner thereof,  shall not alter,  affect or in any way limit
the  obligations of Guarantor  hereunder and this  Unconditional  Guaranty shall
continue in full force and effect.  Guarantor hereby acknowledges that Lender is
the current  owner and holder in due course of the Note and current  beneficiary
under the Deeds of Trust, as amended by the DOT Modifications.

     5. If this  Unconditional  Guaranty  shall  be  placed  in the  hands of an
attorney  for  collection  or should it be  collected  by legal  proceedings  or
through  any  probate or  bankruptcy  court,  Guarantor  agrees to pay to Lender
reasonable attorneys' and collection fees.

     6. Lender may assign its rights under this Unconditional  Guaranty in whole
or in part and upon any such  assignment,  all the terms and  provisions of this
Unconditional Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of such assignee to the extent
so  assigned.  The terms used to  designate  any of the parties  herein shall be
deemed to include the heirs,  legal  representatives,  successors and assigns of
such parties;  and the term "Lender" shall include,  in addition to Lender,  any
lawful  owner,  holder or pledgee  of any  Guaranteed  Indebtedness,  including,
without limitation, the Note.

     7.  Lender  is  relying  and is  entitled  to rely upon each and all of the
provisions of this Unconditional Guaranty; and accordingly,  if any provision or
provisions of this instrument should be held to be invalid or ineffective,  then
all other provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

     8. This Unconditional Guaranty shall be enforceable despite any exculpation
from liability  granted to Borrower.  Without limiting the foregoing,  Guarantor
agrees and acknowledges that  notwithstanding  the provisions of Paragraph 13 of
the Note or any other  provision of the Loan Documents  which  exculpates or may
exculpate  Borrower or limits or may limit the  liability of the  Borrower  with
respect to the Guarantied Indebtedness, Guarantor is and shall be absolutely and
unconditionally  personally  liable  for  the  payment  and  performance  of the
Guaranteed Indebtedness.  Guarantor hereby unconditionally and absolutely waives
and  relinquishes  any defense or claim based in whole or in part on contract or
statutory or common law that would limit the  liability of Guarantor  under this
Guaranty  because of any  exculpation  or  limitation  of  liability or recourse
granted to or claimed by Borrower,  including without  limitation the provisions
of Paragraph 13 of the Note or Section 13.22 of the Deeds of Trust. In addition,
Guarantor  agrees  and  acknowledges  that  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
Paragraph 13 of the Note, or Section  13.22 of the Deeds of Trust,  or any other
provision  of the  Loan  Documents  which  exculpates  Borrower  or  limits  the
liability of the Borrower with respect to the Guarantied Indebtedness, Guarantor
is and shall be absolutely and unconditionally personally liable for the payment
and performance of the Guaranteed Indebtedness.

     9. The  obligations of Guarantor and any other  guarantor of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness  or the Note  shall be joint and  several.  Guarantor  agrees  that
Lender,  in its discretion,  may (a) bring suit against  Guarantor or any one of
the undersigned  and any other  guarantor of the Guaranteed  Indebtedness or the
Note jointly and  severally or against any one or more of them;  (b) compound or
settle with any one or more of the guarantors of the Guaranteed  Indebtedness or
the Note for such  consideration  as Lender may deem proper;  (c) release one or
more of the undersigned or any other  guarantors of the Guaranteed  Indebtedness
or the Note from liability  thereunder and (d) otherwise deal with Guarantor and
any other  guarantor of the Guaranteed  Indebtedness  or the Note, or any one or
more of them, in any manner whatsoever, and that no such action shall impair the
rights of Lender to collect the indebtedness  hereby  guaranteed from Guarantor.
If any  payment  by  Borrower  is held to  constitute  a  preference  under  the
bankruptcy  laws,  or if for any reason Lender is required to refund any sums to
Borrower,  such  amounts  shall not  constitute  a release of any  liability  of
Guarantor  hereunder,  but  Guarantor  agrees  to pay such  amount  to Lender on
demand.   In  the  event   that,   pursuant  to  any   insolvency,   bankruptcy,
reorganization,  receivership or other debtor relief law, or any judgment, order
or decision thereunder,  Lender must rescind or restore any payment, or any part
thereof,  received by Lender in  satisfaction  of any amount owed by Borrower to
Lender,  any prior  release or  discharge  from the terms of this  Unconditional
Guaranty  given to  Guarantor  by  Lender  shall  be  without  effect,  and this
Unconditional  Guaranty  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  effect.  It is the
intention of Lender and Guarantor that Guarantor's  obligations  hereunder shall
not be affected  because any payment by Borrower to Lender is held to constitute
a preference  under any  bankruptcy  laws.  Nothing  contained in this paragraph
shall in any way  affect or impair the rights or  obligations  of the  Guarantor
with respect to any other  guarantor of the Guaranteed  Indebtedness or the Note
evidencing the Guaranteed Indebtedness.

     10. Any  indebtedness  of Borrower  now or  hereafter  held by Guarantor is
hereby subordinated to all indebtedness of Borrower to Lender guaranteed hereby;
and any such indebtedness of Borrower shall be collected,  enforced and received
by Guarantor,  as trustee for Lender,  but without  reducing or affecting in any
manner  the  liability  of  Guarantor   under  the  other   provisions  of  this
Unconditional Guaranty. Until the obligations of Borrower guaranteed hereby have
been paid in full and there has expired the maximum  possible period  thereafter
during  which any  payment  made by  Borrower  to  Lender  with  respect  to the
Guaranteed  Indebtedness  could be deemed a preference  under the United  States
Bankruptcy Code,  Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation unless such right
is expressly granted in writing by Lender.

     11. In the event  Borrower is a  corporation,  joint stock  association  or
partnership,  or is  hereafter  incorporated,  if the  indebtedness  at any time
hereafter exceeds the amount permitted by law, or Borrower is not liable because
the act of creating the  obligation  is ultra vires,  or the officers or persons
creating  indebtedness  to the Lender  which  Guarantor  agrees to pay cannot be
enforced against the corporation,  joint stock association or partnership,  such
fact shall in no manner affect Guarantor's  liability  hereunder;  but Guarantor
shall  be  liable  hereunder,  notwithstanding  said  corporation,  joint  stock
association or partnership is not liable for such  indebtedness  and to the same
extent as  Guarantor  would have been if the  indebtedness  of Borrower had been
unenforceable against it.

     12. Lender,  in its sole discretion,  may apply all payments received by it
from  Borrower  and any other  guarantor  or realized by it from any security in
such manner and order or priority  as Lender  sees fit,  to any  obligations  of
Borrower  under the Loan  Documents,  whether or not any of the  obligations  to
which payment is applied are due at the time of such application.

     13. This  Unconditional  Guaranty  shall be binding upon  Guarantor and its
successors  and  assigns,  and shall  inure to the  benefit  of  Lender  and its
successors and assigns.

     14. THIS UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTY AND ALL RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES
ARISING  HEREUNDER  SHALL IN ALL  RESPECTS BE  GOVERNED  BY, AND  CONSTRUED  AND
ENFORCED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS  (WITHOUT  GIVING
EFFECT TO TEXAS'  PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW).  AS A MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT TO
LENDER TO ACCEPT THIS  UNCONDITIONAL  GUARANTY,  GUARANTOR  UNCONDITIONALLY  AND
IRREVOCABLY  COVENANTS  AND  AGREES  THAT  EXCLUSIVE  VENUE  FOR ANY  ACTION  IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTY SHALL BE IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF
TEXAS,  DALLAS DIVISION;  AND IF GUARANTOR FAILS TO HONOR THE VENUE STIPULATIONS
CONTAINED IN THIS  PARAGRAPH,  LENDER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE REMOVAL OF
ALL PROCEEDINGS TO THE NORTHERN  DISTRICT OF TEXAS,  DALLAS DIVISION.  GUARANTOR
ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT  IT  IS  NOT  IN  A  DISPARATE   BARGAINING   POSITION,   HAS
SOPHISTICATED  FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC  EXPERIENCE  AND THAT THE VENUE  SELECTION
CONTAINED HEREIN IS NOT UNREASONABLE, UNJUST, INCONVENIENT OR OVERREACHING. THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE PERFORMABLE IN DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS.

     15. Until the obligations of Borrower  guaranteed  hereby have been paid in
full and there has expired the maximum possible period  thereafter  during which
any  payment  made  by  Borrower  to  Lender  with  respect  to  the  Guaranteed
Indebtedness  could be deemed a preference  under the United  States  Bankruptcy
Code,  Guarantor hereby  irrevocably  waives all claims or other rights which it
may now have or hereafter acquire against Borrower or any other guarantor of the
Note that arise from the  existence,  payment,  performance  or  enforcement  of
Guarantor's  liabilities  or  obligations  under this Guaranty or any other loan
paper, including,  without limitation, any right of subrogation,  reimbursement,
exoneration,  contribution or indemnification,  whether or not such right, claim
or remedy  arises in equity or under  contract,  statute or common law.  Without
limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  until the  obligations  of Borrower
guaranteed  hereby  have been paid in full and there  has  expired  the  maximum
possible period  thereafter  during which any payment made by Borrower to Lender
with respect to the Guaranteed  Indebtedness  could be deemed a preference under
the United States Bankruptcy Code, Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right
or claim against Borrower or any other person to which Guarantor would otherwise
become subrogated under Chapter 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code.

     16. THIS WRITTEN  UNCONDITIONAL  GUARANTY  REPRESENTS  THE FINAL  AGREEMENT
BETWEEN  THE  PARTIES  AND  MAY  NOT  BE  CONTRADICTED  BY  EVIDENCE  OF  PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS  OR  SUBSEQUENT  ORAL  AGREEMENTS.  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN  ORAL
AGREEMENTS  BETWEEN  THE  PARTIES.  ALL  PRIOR  OR  CONTEMPORANEOUS  AGREEMENTS,
UNDERSTANDINGS,  REPRESENTATIONS,  AND STATEMENTS,  ORAL OR WRITTEN,  ARE MERGED
INTO THIS  UNCONDITIONAL  GUARANTY.  NEITHER THIS  AGREEMENT  NOR ANY  PROVISION
HEREOF MAY BE WAIVED, MODIFIED, AMENDED,  DISCHARGED, OR TERMINATED EXCEPT BY AN
INSTRUMENT IN WRITING SIGNED BY THE PARTY AGAINST WHICH THE  ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH
WAIVER, MODIFICATION,  AMENDMENT,  DISCHARGE, OR TERMINATION IS SOUGHT, AND THEN
ONLY TO THE EXTENT SET FORTH IN SUCH INSTRUMENT.

     17.  LENDER  WILL  GIVE  GUARANTOR  A COPY OF ANY  NOTICES  OF ANY EVENT OF
DEFAULT,  AS  DEFINED  IN THE DEED OF TRUST,  OR ANY EVENT OF WHICH  LENDER  HAS
ACTUAL  KNOWLEDGE,  WHICH  WITH THE  PASSAGE  OF TIME OR  NOTICE  OR BOTH  COULD
CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, AS DEFINED IN THE DEED OF TRUST, AND WILL PERMIT
GUARANTOR THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO CURE SUCH EVENT OF DEFAULT,  INCLUDING NOTICES
OF FORECLOSURE, AS IS AFFORDED TO BORROWER.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  this Unconditional  Guaranty has been duly executed by
the undersigned effective as of the 31st day of December, 2001.

                                R E C I T A L S:
                                 ---------------

     WHEREAS,  Holder is the holder of that certain Deed of Trust Note ("Note"),
dated October 31, 1998, in the original principal amount of $35,200,000, made by
Maker to Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Texas ("KFHPTx"), which Note evidences
a loan  ("Loan")  made by KFHPTx to Maker.  To secure the repayment of the Note,
Maker  also  executed  and  delivered  a Deed of Trust  and  Security  Agreement
("Tarrant Deed of Trust"), dated October 31, 1998, recorded on November 2, 1998,
as Instrument Number D198254090,  Real Property Records,  Tarrant County, Texas,
and a Deed of Trust and  Security  Agreement  ("Dallas  Deed of  Trust"),  dated
October  31,  1998,  recorded  in Volume  98214,  beginning  at Page 4429,  Real
Property Records, Dallas County, Texas (collectively,  the Tarrant Deed of Trust
and the Dallas Deed of Trust are  referred to as the "Deed of Trust") that grant
a first lien on the property ("Property") described in the Deed of Trust.

     WHEREAS, Guarantor has executed that certain Limited Guaranty dated October
31, 1998 (the  "Limited  Guaranty")  and that  certain  Asset Sale and  Purchase
Agreement  dated  June  5,  1998,  executed  by  KFHPTx,  Maker  and  Guarantor,
containing among other provisions,  Section 14.2 (the "Sale Guaranty").  Holder,
Maker,  and  Guarantor  have disputed the  continued  effectiveness  of the Sale
Guaranty as it relates to the Security  Instruments  and the Loan, as defined in
the Deed of Trust, as amended by the  Modification of Deed of Trust. The Limited
Guaranty and the Sale Guaranty are referred to collectively as the "Guaranty."

     WHEREAS  The Note was  endorsed  by KFHPTx  to the order of Holder  and the
Deeds  of  Trust  assigned  to  Holder  pursuant  to  certain   Assignments  and
Assumptions  of Loan  Documents  executed by KFHPTx and Holder  dated  effective
December 31, 2000. The Guaranty was assigned to Holder  pursuant to that certain
Assignment of Guaranty dated effective December 31, 2000.

     WHEREAS,  Holder  agreed to pay  Maker,  Guarantor,  and  certain  of their
affiliates $2,500,000.00 (the "Principal Prepayment Amount") pursuant to Section
1 of that certain Settlement Agreement dated October 3, 2001, effective April 9,
2001 (the "Settlement Agreement").

     WHEREAS,  Holder  and  Maker  have  agreed  to  modify  certain  terms  and
conditions of the Note as set forth in this Agreement.

     WHEREAS,  concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,  Maker, Holder
and Guarantor have entered into two certain  Modifications  of Deed of Trust and
Security  Agreement of even date with this Agreement (the  "Modification of Deed
of Trust").

     WHEREAS,  concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,  Guarantor has
executed and delivered an absolute,  unconditional guaranty (the "New Guaranty")
of the indebtedness and obligations evidenced or secured by the Note, as amended
by  this  Agreement,  and  Deed of  Trust,  as  amended  by the  Deed  of  Trust
Modification.

     WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,  Maker, Guarantor,
and Holder agreed to modify the terms of the Note, as set forth herein below.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  premises,  the  consents  and
agreements   set  forth  in  the   Agreement,   and  other  good  and   valuable
consideration,  the receipt and  sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,
Maker, Guarantor, and Holder hereby amend the Note as follows:

     1. The parties agree that, as of December 31, 2001, unpaid principal on the
Note  equaled  $33,737,796.75.   The  foregoing  principal  balance  takes  into
consideration,  among other things, receipt by Holder of the monthly installment
on the Note  payable  on  January 1, 2002.  In  consideration  of certain  other
agreements by Guarantor, including without limitation the execution and delivery
of the New Guaranty,  Holder hereby forgives payment of principal outstanding on
this Note in the amount of $8,500,000.00 (the "Forgiven Principal Amount") as of
December 31, 2001. Maker hereby directs Holder to apply the Principal Prepayment
Amount to prepay a portion  of the  outstanding  principal  of this  Note.  Upon
application of the Principal Prepayment Amount,  Maker and Guarantor,  on behalf
of themselves  and their  affiliates,  release all claims against Holder and its
affiliates  under  Section 1 of the  Settlement  Agreement  with  respect to the
$2,500,000.00  as applied to the Note.  The parties agree that it shall never be
necessary  to  refer  to  the  Settlement   Agreement  in  connection  with  the
interpretation  of this  Agreement or any other  Security  Instrument  except in
connection  with  the  confirmation  of  the  payment  and  satisfaction  of the
obligations of Holder under Section 1 of the Settlement Agreement. Following the
application of the Principal Prepayment Amount and the Forgiven Principal Amount
as provided in this  Agreement,  the outstanding  principal  balance of the Note
will be $22,737,796.75 as of December 31, 2001. Provided no Event of Default, as
defined in the Deed of Trust,  shall exist,  payment of monthly  installments on
the Note shall be suspended for 12 months commencing with the installment due on
February 1, 2002 and  recommencing on February 1, 2003 and continuing  regularly
thereafter on the first day of each calendar month until maturity of the Note as
provided in Paragraph 4 of the Note, as amended by this Agreement.  The Forgiven
Principal Amount and the Principal  Prepayment Amount shall not (a) be deemed to
apply towards any release  price under  Section  13.18 of the Deed of Trust,  as
amended by the  Modification  of Deed of Trust,  or (b)  relieve  Maker from the
obligation to make regular  monthly  installments as provided under the Note, as
amended hereby.

     2. Paragraph 4 of the Note is amended to read as follows:

          "4.  Principal  and  Interest  Payments;  Prepayment.  Interest at the
     Stated Rate for the period from the date of this Note through and including
     the last day of the month in which the Note is executed shall be payable in
     advance upon  execution of this Note.  Principal and interest at the Stated
     Rate  shall be due and  payable  in  arrears  in  monthly  installments  of
     $211,041.78 commencing on February 1, 2002, and continuing regularly on the
     first day of each calendar month  thereafter  until the earlier to occur of
     (a) November 1, 2006 when the entire amount hereof,  principal and interest
     then  remaining  unpaid,   shall  be  then  due  and  payable  or  (b)  any
     acceleration of payment permitted hereby. Each installment shall be applied
     first to the payment of accrued interest due on the unpaid principal hereof
     and the remainder  shall be applied to the  reduction of unpaid  principal.
     Maker may prepay this Note in part or in whole without premium, however all
     releases  of the  lien  of the  Deed  of  Trust  shall  be  subject  to the
     provisions of Section 13.18 of the Deed of Trust.  Any prepayment  shall be
     applied to reduce the accrued  interest,  then  principal of the Note,  but
     shall  not  relieve  Maker  from the  obligation  to make  regular  monthly
     installments  of  $211,041.78  until the entire  principal  balance and all
     accrued interest has been paid in full."

     3. Maker and Guarantor  hereby agree that the  modification of the Note set
forth  herein shall in no manner  impair the  Guaranty,  the Deed of Trust,  the
Note, or the liens securing the same and that said liens shall not in any manner
be waived, the purpose of this Agreement being simply to modify the Note, and to
carry forward all liens securing the same,  which are  acknowledged by Maker and
Guarantor to be valid and subsisting.

     4. Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  the terms and  provisions of the
Note,  Guaranty,  and Deed of Trust shall be and remain in full force and effect
as therein  written.  Maker hereby  ratifies the agreements made by it to Holder
under the Note, Deed of Trust and each other agreement  executed or delivered by
Maker in connection with the Loan and agrees that the Note, except to the extent
modified  hereby,  the Deed of Trust, and each such other agreement shall remain
in full force and effect.  As inducement to Holder and in  consideration  of the
agreements  of Holder  herein  contained,  concurrently  with the  execution and
delivery of this  Agreement by Holder,  Guarantor  hereby  agrees to execute and
deliver the New Guaranty in  replacement  of the  Guaranty.  Guarantor and Maker
agree and  acknowledge  that but for the execution,  delivery and performance of
the New  Guaranty,  Holder  would  not enter  into or  deliver  this  Agreement,
Modification of Deed of Trust,  or  substitution of the Guaranty.  Holder agrees
that and  acknowledges  that upon execution and delivery by Guarantor of the New
Guaranty to Holder,  (a) the Limited  Guaranty  shall be released and terminated
and of no further force and effect and (b) the Sales  Guaranty shall be released
and  terminated  and no  further  force or effect as it may relate in any manner
whatsoever to the Security  Instruments  or the Loan,  but shall  continue to be
effective  in  accordance  with  its  terms  as  to  all  other  obligations  or
indebtedness  guarantied.  Promptly  after the  execution  and  delivery of this
Agreement,  the  Modification of Deed of Trust,  and New Guaranty,  Holder shall
return all original copies of the Limited Guaranty to Guarantor.

     5. This Agreement and all of the covenants and agreements  contained herein
shall  be and are  binding  upon  and  shall  inure  to the  benefit  of  Maker,
Guarantor, and Holder and each of their respective successors and assigns.

     6. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT  THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNITED  STATES MAY REQUIRE OR
OTHERWISE  CONTROL,  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS HEREOF, AND THE
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREIN, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
AND  INTERPRETED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS,  (WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAW OF SUCH STATE).

     7. This Agreement may be executed in multiple  counterparts,  each of which
shall be regarded  for all purposes as one  original,  it shall not be necessary
that all signatories  thereto sign all such counterparts so long as at least one
such counterpart  shall be signed by each such signatory,  and such counterparts
shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

     8. As a  condition  to the  effectiveness  of the  Modification  of Deed of
Trust, and this Agreement,  concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement,  all those  amounts held in escrow  pursuant to that  certain  Escrow
Agreement dated November 1, 2001,  executed by American  Escrow  Company,  Inc.,
Beneficiary  and Grantor  shall be released and  delivered to  Beneficiary  upon
execution and delivery of this Agreement by all parties hereto.

     9. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT,  THE NEW GUARANTY,  AND THE MODIFICATION OF DEED
OF  TRUST,  TOGETHER  WITH  THE  NOTE AND DEED OF  TRUST,  REPRESENT  THE  FINAL
AGREEMENT  BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS. FURTHERMORE, GUARANTOR, MAKER AND
HOLDER AGREE THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
