<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company and the Executive entered into an employment agreement as of November&nbsp;20, 2001 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Original Employment

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company and the Executive desire to continue the Executive's service as its President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of its Board of Directors (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Board</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and of the Executive Committee of the Board (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Executive Committee</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Company and the Executive desire to amend and restate the Original Employment Agreement as set forth herein and the Executive is willing to continue to serve in his current
positions under the terms and conditions of this amended and restated agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the Company and the Executive (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Parties</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term of Employment.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive's term of employment under this Agreement
(the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Term</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") commenced on November&nbsp;20, 2001 and shall continue through the close of business on December&nbsp;31, 2008, subject to earlier
termination as provided in Section&nbsp;8 below. The "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Initial Term</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall mean
November&nbsp;20, 2001 through December&nbsp;31, 2003 and the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>New Term</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall mean January&nbsp;1, 2004 through the close of business on

Chief
Executive Officer and as a member of the Board and of the Executive Committee, with all responsibilities and authorities normally associated with those positions in a company of the size and nature of
the Company. The Executive shall report directly to the Board. The Executive's employment under this Agreement shall be performed outside the United States. The amount of time the Executive spends in
Bermuda and Europe shall be such time as is reasonably necessary to perform his responsibilities and services hereunder, except for the amount of time necessary for him to attend meetings of the Board
and of committees of the Board of which he is a member. It is understood that the Executive will not redomicile to Bermuda but that he expects to maintain a resident in Bermuda. The Executive shall
devote substantially all of his business time and efforts to the business and affairs of the Company and its Affiliates (an "Affiliate" of any person means any entity that controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with, such person). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permitted Activities.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
nothing shall
preclude the Executive from </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>(i)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> serving on the boards of directors of a reasonable number of other corporations or the boards of a reasonable number of
trade associations and/or charitable organizations, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>(ii)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> engaging in charitable, community and other business affairs and </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>(iii)</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> managing his personal
investments and affairs, provided such activities do not, in his reasonable judgment, materially interfere with the proper
performance of his responsibilities and duties hereunder. </FONT></P>

annual
rate of no less than US$1,000,000 during the Initial Term and at an annual rate of no less than US$1,250,000 during the New Term. The Base Salary shall be payable in accordance with the regular
payroll practices applicable to senior executives of the Company, but no less frequently than monthly. Such Base Salary </FONT></P>

the performance goals established for the relevant year are met. If such performance goals are exceeded, the Executive shall receive a larger amount of up to 200% of the Target Bonus or more at the
discretion of the
Compensation Committee. The performance goals for each year shall be established by the Board (or a committee thereof) unless such goals are set forth in the applicable Incentive Plan. For fiscal year
2003, the Executive may be awarded such annual bonuses as may be determined by the Board (or a committee thereof), based on any Incentive Plan; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,
however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, in no event shall the annual bonus for fiscal year 2003 be less than 75% of the annual Base Salary for the Initial Term. Any such annual bonus shall, unless otherwise
required under the applicable Incentive Plan, be paid in cash in a lump sum promptly following determination thereof. </FONT></P>

Exhibit&nbsp;A (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Option Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), such grant representing 1.5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of November&nbsp;20, 2001. </FONT></P>

eligible
during the Term to participate in the Company's long-incentive plans, including, but not limited to, the Company's 2003 Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan, as amended from time

Programs</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). To the extent that the Executive is not eligible to participate in any Benefit Program, he shall be provided with the after-tax economic equivalent of
the coverages and benefits provided under such program in which he is unable to participate. In addition, if necessary, the Executive shall be provided interim coverage until such time as the Company
has adopted a program of employee benefit coverages. Interim coverage may be provided through purchase of separate insurance contracts, through self-insurance or, to the extent the
Executive is permitted to continue to maintain on a contributory basis the benefits he presently receives from other sources, by reimbursing the Executive for the cost thereof on a basis that keeps
the Executive whole after taxes. The Executive shall be entitled to a supplemental executive retirement benefit upon terms and conditions determined by the Board, and the Company shall provide this
benefit pursuant to a separate agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>SERP Agreement"</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>). </FONT></P>

in Paragraph&nbsp;9(d) below. </FONT></P>

and become exercisable, on certain terminations of the Optionee's employment with the Company under the Employment Agreement to the extent set forth in Section&nbsp;8 of the Employment Agreement.
Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;8 of the Employment Agreement, the Option shall expire on any termination of the Option Holder's employment with the Company. The Option shall
be exercisable by the Option Holder, or in the event of his death or his judicially determined incompetence, by his estate or other legal representative, or, to the extent the Option is transferred,
in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph&nbsp;(i) below, by a transferee of the Option Holder (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Transferee</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). As
hereinafter used, the term "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Option Holder</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall include the Option Holder's estate, other legal representative or Transferee, as appropriate. </FONT></P>

shall
submit to the Company an instrument in writing specifying the number of Option Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised, accompanied by payment, in a manner reasonably acceptable to
the Company, of the aggregate Option Price for the Option Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised. A share certificate, or certificates, representing the purchased Option Shares shall
then promptly be delivered to the Option Holder; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Option Shares hereunder if
the delivery of such Option Shares would violate the provisions of any applicable law, in which event the Company shall, as soon as practicable, take whatever action it reasonably can so that such
Option Shares may be delivered without resulting in such violation of law. </FONT></P>
