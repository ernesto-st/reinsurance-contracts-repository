<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;In exchange for the CCC Administrative Services, Surety hereby covenants and agrees to
remit to CCC compensation in the manner set forth in <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U> attached hereto and
incorporated herein (&#147;<I>CCC Administrative Services Fee</I>&#148;). The CCC Administrative Services Fee shall
be: (1)&nbsp;substantially equivalent to the parties&#146; good faith estimate of Surety&#146;s anticipated usage
of the then current definition of the CCC Administrative Services; (2)&nbsp;based on an equitable
allocation of the actual costs incurred by CCC in providing the CCC Administrative Services
including, without limitation, salaries, rent, utility charges, legal expenses and auditing fees,
as well as sales, excise, value added and real estate taxes; and (3)&nbsp;in conformity with customary
insurance accounting practices consistently applied in compliance with applicable governmental
rules and regulations in a manner that reflects the reasonable, customary and usual charges for the
CCC Administrative Services established in accordance with prudent and rational cost accounting
methodologies and in conformity with applicable arm&#146;s length pricing regulations. The CCC
Administrative Services Fee shall also include reimbursement to CCC for any and all third party
charges CCC incurs in connection with the CCC Administrative Services, plus an arm&#146;s length markup
of certain costs to the extent they involve any of the CCC Administrative Services that are not
eligible for allocation to Surety under the services cost method (SCM), as defined by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service from time to time (<I>see e.g., </I>Treasury Regulation &#167;1.482-9T(b)).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The portion of the CCC Administrative Services Fee related to procuring and providing
office space, along with related real estate services, to Surety pursuant to Section 1(h) (&#147;<I>CCC
Real Estate Services Fee</I>&#148;) is initially calculated based on Surety&#146;s percentage of rentable square
feet in each office location as negotiated between both parties at the time the lease is executed.
For the purpose of calculating the CCC Real Estate Services Fee, Surety&#146;s percentage of rentable
square feet will remain unchanged until any one of the following conditions is met: (1)&nbsp;Surety
request to occupy and subsequently occupies additional space in the office location; (2)&nbsp;the
percentage is renegotiated between both parties due to a significant change in the number of
occupants in the office location; (3)&nbsp;the lease term is modified; or (4)&nbsp;the lease expires.
Although CCC shall monitor periodic changes to Surety&#146;s percentage of rentable square feet, for
administrative convenience, the parties shall true up the CCC Real Estate Services Fee on an annual
basis through the ordinary course of reconciling accounts between the parties. The results of the
true up shall be mutually agreed by the parties, as evidenced by the approval of CCC&#146;s Controller
and Surety&#146;s Chief Financial Officer (or their respective designees), which approval need not be in
writing. Except as provided in this Section 6(b) and Sections 6(c) and 6(d), the CCC
Administrative Services Fee shall be fixed and shall not be subject to any true up or other
modification, regardless of Surety&#146;s use or non-use of the CCC Administrative Services.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;6 of the Agreement, the CCC Administrative Services Fee shall be four million
four hundred sixty-nine thousand one hundred forty dollars ($4,469,140). The CCC Administrative
Services Fee shall be payable in twelve (12)&nbsp;equal installments on or before the last day of each
month during the Term, either through cash or an inter-company credit. If the Term ends during the
course of a calendar year, the CCC Administrative Services Fee shall be equitably pro-rated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Based on surveys conducted by CCC to identify all planned activities to be performed by CCC for the
benefit of Surety, the estimated cost of providing the CCC Administrative Services was determined
by using time and cost estimates developed by subject matter experts during the 2010 annual
corporate planning cycle. Hourly cost rates are based on average employee cost rates by pay grade
and include, without limitation, the cost of employee salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, space
utilization, end-user computing, corporate insurance, and human resources support.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As provided in Section 6(b) of the Agreement, the parties shall true up the CCC Real Estate
Services Fee on an annual basis through the ordinary course of reconciling accounts between the
parties. The results of the true up shall be mutually agreed by the parties, as evidenced by the
approval of CCC&#146;s Controller and Surety&#146;s Chief Financial Officer (or their respective designees),
which approval need not be in writing. Except as provided in Section 6(b) and Sections 6(c) and
6(d) of the Agreement, the CCC Administrative Services Fee shall be fixed and shall not be subject
to any true up or other modification, regardless of Surety&#146;s use or non-use of the CCC
Administrative Services.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The expansion or other modification of the specific CCC Administrative Services shall be provided
at mutually acceptable rates determined in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the
calculation of the CCC Administrative Services Fee, as further described in Section&nbsp;6 of the
Agreement. The addition or deletion of any non-recurring CCC Administrative Services shall be
mutually approved by CCC&#146;s Controller and Surety&#146;s Chief Financial Officer (or their respective
designees), which approval need not be in writing, but the addition or deletion of any recurring
CCC Administrative Services that are material in nature or dollar amount shall be evidenced by a
mutually executed updated version of <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U> which shall automatically supersede and
replace in its entirety the then current version of <U>Appendix&nbsp;A</U>.
