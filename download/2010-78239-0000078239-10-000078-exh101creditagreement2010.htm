Subject to the terms of Section 9 hereof, &nbsp;the lien of this Mortgage shall not in any manner be impaired or affected by any release (except as to the property released), sale, pledge, surrender, compromise, settlement, renewal, extension, indulgence, alteration, changing, modification or disposition of any of the Obligations or of any of the collateral security therefor, including the Other Mortgages or any guarantee thereof, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Mortgagee may at its discretion foreclose, exercise any power of sale, or exercise any other remedy available to it under any or all of the Other Mortgages without first exercising or enforcing any of its rights and remedies hereunder. &nbsp;Such exercise of Mortgagee&#146;s rights and remedies under any or all of the Other Mortgages shall not in any manner impair the indebtedness hereby secured or the lien of this Mortgage and any exercise of the rights and remedies of Mortgagee hereunder shall not impair the lien of any of the Other Mortgages or any of Mortgagee&#146;s rights and remedies thereunder. &nbsp;To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Mortgagor specifically consents and agrees that Mortgagee may exercise its rights and remedies hereunder and under the Other Mortgages separately or concurrently and in any order that it may deem appropriate and waives any right of subrogation.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>WHEREAS</B>, Collateral Agent has requested that Landlord execute this Agreement as a condition to the extension of credit to Tenant under the Credit Agreement.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify><B>NOW</B>, <B>THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Landlord hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants and agrees with, Collateral Agent as follows:</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>1. &nbsp;Landlord hereby (a)&nbsp;waives and releases unto Collateral Agent and its successors and assigns any and all rights granted by or under any present or future laws to levy or distraint for rent or any other charges which may be due to Landlord against the Collateral, and any and all other claims, liens and demands of every kind which it now has or may hereafter have against the Collateral, and (b)&nbsp;agrees that any rights it may have in or to the Collateral, no matter how arising (to the extent not effectively waived pursuant to clause (a) of this paragraph 1), shall be second and subordinate to the rights of Collateral Agent in respect thereof. &nbsp;Landlord acknowledges that the Collateral is and will remain personal property and not fixtures even though it may be affixed to or placed on the Premises.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>2. &nbsp;Landlord consents to the placement of the Collateral on the Premises, and Landlord grants to Collateral Agent a revocable license to enter upon and into the Premises to do any or all of the following with respect to the Collateral: &nbsp;assemble, have appraised, display, remove, maintain, prepare for sale or lease, repair, transfer, or sell (at public or private sale). &nbsp;In entering upon or into the Premises, Collateral Agent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, judgments, liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by Landlord caused solely by Collateral Agent&#146;s entering upon or into the Premises and taking any of the foregoing actions with respect to the Collateral. &nbsp;Such costs shall include any damage to the Premises made by Collateral Agent in severing and/or removing the Collateral therefrom.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>3. &nbsp;Landlord agrees that it will not prevent Collateral Agent or its designee from entering upon the Premises at all reasonable times to inspect or remove the Collateral. &nbsp;In the event that Landlord has the right to, and desires to, obtain possession of the Premises due to the default of Tenant thereunder, Landlord will deliver to Collateral Agent a copy of the notice (the &#147;<U>Landlord&#146;s Notice</U>&#148;) that it delivered to the Tenant to that effect. &nbsp;Within the 30 day period after Collateral Agent receives the Landlord&#146;s Notice, Collateral Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Collateral to be removed from the Premises. &nbsp;During such 30 day period, Landlord will not remove the Collateral from the Premises nor interfere with Collateral Agent&#146;s actions in removing the Collateral from the Premises or Collateral Agent&#146;s actions in otherwise enforcing its security interest in the Collateral. &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, Collateral Agent shall at no time have any obligation to remove the Collateral from the Premises.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>4. &nbsp;Landlord shall send to Collateral Agent a copy of any notice of default under the Lease sent by Landlord to Tenant. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>5. &nbsp;All notices to Collateral Agent under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent to Collateral Agent at its address set forth on the signature page hereof by telefacsimile, by United States mail, or by overnight delivery service.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>6. &nbsp;The provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect until Landlord shall have received Collateral Agent&#146;s written certification that all amounts advanced under the Credit Agreement have been paid in full.</P>
