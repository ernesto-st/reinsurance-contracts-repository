State") during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending thirty (30)
days following the Closing Date and (B) the Purchase Price has been reduced
pursuant to Section 2.2(d)(i) or (ii), the Purchase Price for the Shares shall
be increased by an amount equal to $82,500 for each such Newly Authorized State
(or $200,000 for California) and such amount shall be paid by Purchaser to
Seller on the later of the Closing Date and two (2) Business Days of the
Company's obtaining such authorization; provided, however, in no event shall the
aggregate Purchase Price payable after giving effect to the adjustments pursuant
to this Section 2.2(d) exceed the sum of (1) three million five hundred thousand
dollars ($3,500,000) plus (2) the Capital and Surplus Amount.

                       (iv)     Following the closing, Seller and Purchaser
         shall cooperate and exert reasonable best efforts to try to have the
         Company's authorization to issue insurance policies on an excess or
         surplus lines basis in any state listed on Schedule 3.17(c)(i) hereto
         reinstated by the relevant regulatory authority; provided that the
         parties will consult with each other with respect to all such actions.

Defense, it shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing of such assumption
within

                                       30

<PAGE>

twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of such notice and thereafter promptly
advise the Indemnified Party of its activities and efforts in connection
therewith and of the ultimate resolution of such Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to settle, compromise or adjust any such Claim, provided
that (i) any such settlement, compromise or adjustment may not bind the
Indemnified Party or their Affiliates (including the Company if Purchaser is the
Indemnified Party) without the Indemnified Party's express written consent, (ii)
if Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party's rights in and to

reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified Party and its counsel in order to
permit counsel of the Indemnified Party to monitor effectively the progress and
status from time to time of any such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to

provided that the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such
action. In such event, the Indemnified Party shall be fully entitled to
indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
no event shall any rights of indemnity hereunder in any way limit the
application of the RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.3. VALUATION OF CLAIM. After the Indemnified Party
has determined the dollar amount of the Claim in respect of any Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall provide written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
amount of such Claim, which notice shall include in reasonable detail
information explaining calculation of the amount of such Claim. Any such notice
may be given with respect to a previously unascertained amount attributable to a
Claim which was the subject of a prior notice. Unless, within thirty (30) days
after the receipt of any such notice by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party receives written notice that the Indemnifying Party does not concur with
the Indemnified Party's determination of the amount of the Claim, the amount of
such Claim provided in such written notice shall conclusively be deemed to have
been accepted by the Indemnifying Party and to be the agreed amount which the
Indemnified Party (and, if Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, the Company) are
entitled to receive by way of indemnification from the Indemnifying Party (the
"Indemnification Loss"). If the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30)
Business Day period receives written notice that the Indemnifying Party
disagrees with the amount of the Claim, the parties shall endeavor forthwith,
and within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of disagreement by the
Indemnified Party, to negotiate in good faith to resolve the issue or issues
which form the basis of their disagreement. If no resolution with respect to
such disagreement has been reached by the parties within such thirty (30) day
period, either the Indemnified Party (if Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, on
behalf of itself or the Company) or the Indemnifying Party may commence
litigation with respect to such disagreement in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States of America.

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 9.4. PAYMENT OF INDEMNIFICATION LOSS. Any
Indemnification Loss payable by the Indemnifying Party hereunder shall be
promptly remitted by the Indemnifying Party to a bank account of the Indemnified
Party (or, if Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, the Company), as designated in
writing by the Indemnified Party, within thirty (30) Business Days after the
final non-appealable determination of the amount of the Indemnification Loss.

                  SECTION 9.5. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. Purchaser and Seller
agree to treat, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, any payments
under this Article IX or Article X as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price
for all Tax purposes.

                  SECTION 9.6. NO DUPLICATION. Any liability for indemnification
hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of (i)
the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) the liability
of the Indemnifying Party or any Affiliate thereof under a Landmark Ancillary
Agreement, the Acquisition Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement (as such term is
defined in the Acquisition Agreement).

                                    ARTICLE X

                                   TAX MATTERS

                  SECTION 10.1. TRANSFER TAXES. All Transfer Taxes, if any,
arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. The parties shall
cause all appropriate stock Transfer Tax stamps to be affixed to the certificate
or certificates representing the Shares so sold and delivered. Seller and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing
of, all Tax Returns, applications or other documents regarding any Transfer
Taxes that become payable pursuant to this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.2. TAX MATTERS. Except as provided in Section 10.1
hereof:

                  (a)      Parent or Seller shall file or cause to be filed when
due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed for any Pre-Closing Period by
or with respect to the Company and Parent or Seller shall remit (or cause to be
remitted) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns
will be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of Seller and the
Company.

                  (b)      Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due
all Tax Returns that are required to be filed for any Post-Closing Period or any
Straddle Period by or with respect to the Company and, subject to Sections
10.2(d) and 10.3 hereof, Purchaser shall remit (or cause to be remitted) any
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

                  (c)      Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare in a
manner consistent with past practice of the Company and to deliver to Parent or
Seller, all relevant Tax information relating to the Company reasonably required
to permit Parent or Seller to file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns
required to be filed or caused to be filed by Parent or Seller pursuant to
Section 10.2(a) of this Agreement.

                                       32

<PAGE>

                  (d)      In the case of any Tax Return for any Straddle
Period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of the completed Tax Return
for such taxable period and a schedule apportioning the Tax shown on such Tax
Return as between Seller and Purchaser and specifying the amount due to or from
Seller (all computed in accordance with Section 10.3 hereof), together with such
related work papers and other documents as Seller shall reasonably request, no
later than forty-five (45) days before the due date for the filing of such Tax
Return. Seller and its authorized representatives shall have the right to review
the Tax Return and schedule received from Purchaser pursuant to the terms of
this Section 10.2(d). Seller and Purchaser agree to consult each other and
resolve in good faith any issues arising under the terms of this Section 10.2(d)
as a result of the review of any such Tax Returns and schedule received from
Purchaser. If the parties agree upon the contents of the Tax Return and the
schedule, then the Tax Return shall be filed as so agreed and the amount of Tax,
if any, due from Seller shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser no later than two
(2) days prior to the date of filing of such Tax Return or the amount of Tax
due, if any, from Purchaser to Seller shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller no
later than three (3) days after the date of filing of such Tax Return. If the
parties are unable to resolve any dispute as to any Tax Return or accompanying
schedule within thirty (30) days after the provision of such Tax Return or
schedule to the Seller, the parties shall refer the dispute to an independent
mutually agreed upon nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Independent
Firm") to act as an arbitrator to resolve the disagreement prior to the due date
of the filing of such Tax Return. The Independent Firm's determination shall be
final and binding upon the parties, and all fees and expenses relating to the
engagement of the Independent Firm shall be shared equally by Seller and
Purchaser.

                  (e)      Seller or Parent shall cause any Tax sharing
agreement or similar arrangement with respect to Taxes involving the Company, on
the one hand, and Seller, Parent or any Affiliates of either, on the other hand,
to be terminated effective as of the Closing Date, so that to the extent any
such agreement or arrangement relates to the Company after the Closing Date,
none of the Company, Seller, Parent nor the Affiliates of any of them shall have
any obligation thereunder to the other, whether to make payment or otherwise,
under any such agreement or arrangement for any past, present or future period.

                  (f)      Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, from the date hereof to and including the Closing Date, neither
Parent nor Seller without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) will permit the
Company to directly or indirectly (i) make, change or revoke, or permit to be
made, changed or revoked, any material election or method of accounting, with
respect to Taxes affecting the Company for Post-Closing Tax Periods, or (ii)
enter into, or permit to be entered into, any closing or other agreement or
settlement with respect to Taxes of the Company affecting or relating to
Post-Closing Tax Periods.

                  SECTION 10.3. COMPUTATION OF TAX LIABILITIES. To the extent
permitted or required by Applicable Law or administrative practice, (i) the
taxable period of the Company that began on January 1 of the calendar year which
includes the Closing Date

                                       33
<PAGE>

shall be treated as closing as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (ii) all transactions not in the ordinary course
of business and properly allocable thereunder to the portion of the day after
the Closing shall be reported on Purchaser's consolidated United States federal
income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) and shall be similarly reported on other Tax Returns of
Purchaser or its Affiliates to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and (iii)
no election shall be made under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)
(relating to ratable allocation of a year's items). For purposes of this
Agreement, where it is necessary to apportion between Seller and Purchaser the
Tax liability of an entity for a Straddle Period (which is not treated under the
immediately preceding sentence as closing on the Closing Date), such liability
shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the
Closing Date, and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books,
except that Taxes (such as real property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis
shall be allocated on a daily basis. In determining Seller's liability for Taxes
pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall be credited with the amount of
estimated or actual Taxes paid by or on behalf of the Company prior to the
Closing. To the extent that Seller's liability for Taxes of the Company for a
Straddle Period is less than the amount of estimated or actual Taxes previously
paid by or on behalf of the Company with respect to such Straddle Period,
Purchaser shall pay Seller the difference within three (3) days of the filing of
the Tax Return relating to such Tax. Purchaser shall pay Seller the value of any
Tax Credit used by Purchaser to offset premium Taxes on premiums written in any
Post-Closing tax period to the extent that such credits are attributable to
payments made by or on behalf of Company prior to or on the Closing Date within
three (3) days of the filing of the Tax Return relating to such Tax. Parent,
Seller and the Purchaser further agree to file all Tax Returns (including,
without limitation, all State income Tax Returns), handle the contest of any
audit and otherwise act for all Tax purposes consistent with the provisions of
this Section 10.3.

                  SECTION 10.4. SELLER'S INDEMNITY FOR TAXES. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary:

                  (a)      Seller shall pay and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates, successors
and permitted assigns from: (i) all liability for Taxes of the Company for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the Seller's portion of the Straddle Period (as
determined pursuant to Section 10.2(d) hereof), including any liability of the
Parent Group for additional Taxes arising solely as a result of the Section 338
Elections if elected, as set forth below; (ii) all liability resulting by reason
of the several liability of the Company pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 or any similar provision of Applicable Law or by reason of the Company
ever having been a member of any consolidated, combined or unitary group on or
prior to the Closing Date; and (iii) all Damages (as such term is defined in
Section 9.1) attributable to any misrepresentation or breach or non-performance
of warranty or agreement made by the Seller or the Parent in Section 3.11 or
this Article X.

                  (b)      The representations and warranties of Seller and the
agreements of the parties contained in this Article X shall survive the Closing
and shall continue in full

                                       34

<PAGE>

force and effect until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the Tax to which the representation, warranty or agreement
relates. There shall be no limit on the aggregate amount for which Seller shall
be liable under Section 10.4(a) hereof and no deductible shall apply.

                  SECTION 10.5. ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing
Date, both Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) in good faith cooperate with and assist the other in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Returns (including any amended Tax Returns), the
determination of the requesting party's own liability for Taxes, any audit or
other examination by any Taxing Authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to liability for Taxes. The party requesting assistance
hereunder shall (i) make such request in writing and (ii) reimburse the other
party for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
assistance. In addition, neither party shall dispose of any Tax workpapers,
books or records relating to the Company during the six-year period following
the Closing Date, and thereafter shall give the other party written notice
before disposing of such items and a reasonable opportunity to copy or take
possession of the same prior to their disposition. Each party shall be free to
dispose of such items after the expiration of the six-year period, unless such
other party provides notice within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the
six-year period that such other party intends to copy or take possession of such
items. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section 10.5 shall be held in
strict confidence and shall be used solely in connection with the reason for
which it was requested.

                  SECTION 10.6. REFUNDS. Any Tax refund (including any interest
in respect thereof but net of any Tax imposed thereon) received by Purchaser or
its Affiliates, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax
Returns), that relate to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or
before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller, and Purchaser shall
pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit within five
(5) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. Purchaser shall pay Seller
interest at the rate prescribed under section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded
daily, on any amount not paid when due pursuant to the preceding sentence.

                  SECTION 10.7. CONTESTS. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

                  (a)      After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify Seller
in writing within ten (10) days of the date a claim is made or threatened in
writing by any Taxing Authority that, if successful, may reasonably be expected
to result in an indemnity payment by Seller under Section 10.4 (a "Tax Claim").
Such notice shall contain factual information describing in reasonable detail
the nature and basis of such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known,
and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any
Taxing Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. Failure by
Purchaser to give such notice to the Seller shall not relieve the Seller of any
liability that it may have on account of its indemnification obligation under
this Article X, except to the extent that the Seller is materially and adversely
prejudiced thereby in the defense of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that
irrespective of whether

                                       35

<PAGE>

the Seller is materially or adversely prejudiced, Seller may reduce any
liability Seller may have on account of its indemnification obligation under
this Article X by the amount of its actual, out-of-pocket monetary damages that
are caused by the Purchaser's failure to timely give the notice required
pursuant to this Section 10.7(a).

                  (b)      Seller will have the right, at its option, upon
timely notice to Purchaser, to assume at its own expense control of any audit or
other defense of any Tax Claim (other than a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes
of the Company for a Straddle Period, which as described below, the parties
shall jointly control) with its own counsel, provided that Seller's notice
acknowledges Seller's indemnification liability for such claim. Seller's right
to control a Tax Claim will be limited to issues in respect of which amounts in
dispute would be paid by Seller or for which Seller would be liable pursuant to
Section 10.4. Costs of defending or contesting such Tax Claims are to be borne
by Seller unless the Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period, in which event such
costs shall be fairly apportioned as described below. Purchaser and the Company
at their own expense each shall cooperate with Seller in contesting any Tax
Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon Seller's request,
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Tax Claim and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall neither consent nor agree
to the settlement of any Tax Claim with respect to any liability for Taxes that
may affect the liability for any state, federal or foreign income tax of the
Company or any affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a) of the Code) of
which the Company is a member for any Post-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and neither Seller, nor any Affiliate of Seller, shall
file an amended Tax Return that may increase the liability for Taxes of the
Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Purchaser and Seller shall jointly control all proceedings taken in
connection with any Tax Claims relating solely to a Straddle Period of the
Company and each party shall bear its own out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
the contest and all joint costs and expenses of the contest shall be borne in
the same ratio as the applicable proposed Tax would be allocated.

                  SECTION 10.8. POST-CLOSING ACTIONS WHICH AFFECT SELLER'S
LIABILITY FOR TAXES.

                  (a)      Purchaser shall not allow or cause the Company to
take, or fail to take, any action or omit to take any action after the Closing
Date as to which Seller has notified Purchaser in writing on or before the
Closing Date if the taking of such action or the failure to take such action
will increase the Taxes of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period provided
that the taking of such action or the failure to take such action does not
materially affect the conduct of the Company's Business after the Closing Date.

                  (b)      None of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall
(or shall cause or permit the Company to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any
Tax Return

                                       36

<PAGE>

relating in whole or in part to the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be
withheld in the sole discretion of Seller.

                  (c)      None of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall
(or shall cause or permit the Company to) carryback for federal, state, local or
foreign Tax purposes to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the portion of any
Straddle Period ending before the Closing Date of the Company, Seller, or any
Affiliate of Seller, any operating losses, net operating losses, capital losses,
tax credits or similar items arising in, resulting from, or generated in
connection with a taxable year of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser, or
portion thereof, ending on or after the Closing Date.

                  SECTION 10.9. SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION.

                  (a)      Within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall furnish Seller with Purchaser's proposed allocation of the
Purchase Price among the Shares and the other transactions, rights and
obligations contemplated pursuant to this Agreement and the Landmark Ancillary
Agreements, the determination of the ADSP (as defined in applicable Treasury
Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) and the allocation of ADSP among the
assets of the Company and other relevant items (the "Proposed Allocation").
Purchaser and Seller each agree to consult in good faith with regard to the
proposed determination and the Proposed Allocation, provided that Seller shall
accept Purchaser's final determination of the ADSP and the Proposed Allocation
to the extent that they are reasonable and consistent with Applicable Law
(which, when accepted, shall become the "Final Allocation"). Within thirty (30)
days after the determination of the Final Allocation, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount of
cash ("Seller's Tax Cost") that Seller reasonably estimates is necessary to
ensure that the net proceeds derived by Seller from the sale of the Shares if
the Purchaser elects to make the elections provided for under Section 338(h)(10)
of the Code and any similar elections required to be, or treated as, made under
any applicable state or local Tax laws as a result of the federal election
(collectively, the "Section 338 Elections") is not less than the amount of net
proceeds Seller would have derived from the sale of the Shares in the absence of
the Section 338 Elections. The Seller's Tax Cost shall be computed (1) on an
after-Tax basis including, without limitation any additional Taxes imposed on
the receipt of any additional amounts or attributable to the allocation of ADSP
to anything other than the Shares, and (2) on the basis such that the after-Tax
proceeds to Seller of the receipt of the Final Purchase Price plus the Seller's
Tax Cost equals the amount of after-Tax proceeds the Seller would have received
from the sale of the Company shares in exchange for the Final Purchase Price if
the Section 338 Elections were not made and the entire final Purchase Price were
allocable solely to the Shares. Purchaser and Seller each agree to consult in
good faith with regard to the determination and calculation of Seller's Tax
Cost, provided that Purchaser shall accept Seller's final determination of
Seller's Tax Cost to the extent that it is reasonable and consistent with
Applicable Law (which, when accepted, shall become the "Final Seller's Tax
Cost").

                                       37

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by
Purchaser of the schedule of Final Seller's Tax Cost, Purchaser shall notify
Seller of Purchaser's decision as to whether to make the Section 338 Elections.
If Purchaser decides to make the Section 338 Elections, Seller agrees to (or to
cause Parent to, if applicable) join with Purchaser in making timely and
irrevocable Section 338 Elections, provided Seller receives the payment of Final
Seller's Tax Cost as provided in Section 10.9(c) hereof. If Purchaser decides to
make the Section 338 Elections, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
preparing drafts of all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate
the Section 338 Elections, including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023 or
applicable successor form, and any similar forms or applicable successor forms
under applicable state or local income tax laws (the "Section 338 Forms"), and
Purchaser shall furnish a copy of the draft Section 338 Forms to Seller for
Seller's review and comment, which Seller agrees to do promptly. Seller shall,
and if required, Seller shall cause Parent to, cooperate in good faith with
Purchaser's preparation of the Section 338 Forms, and Seller agrees to promptly
provide (or cause Parent to promptly provide) to Purchaser true, correct and
complete information regarding Seller (or Parent or Parent Group, if applicable)
reasonably requested by Purchaser and necessary to complete the Section 338
Forms.

                  (c)      Thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for
execution by Seller (or Parent, if applicable) the final Section 338 Forms.
Within five (5) days of delivering the final Section 338 Forms to Seller,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller (by wire transfer in U.S. Dollars of immediately
available funds to the bank account specified by Seller to Purchaser) an amount
equal to Final Seller's Tax Cost, and Seller (or Parent, if applicable) agrees
to and shall simultaneously execute and deliver to Purchaser the final Section
338 Forms.

                  (d)      If Purchaser has paid to Seller Seller's Final Tax
Cost, then Seller agrees that Seller (i) shall, or shall cause Parent to, report
the acquisition of the Company by Purchaser in a manner consistent with the
making of the Section 338 Elections (ii) shall not, and shall cause Parent and
each member of Parent Group not to, take a position in any Tax Return or audit
or any proceeding before any Taxing Authority or otherwise inconsistent with the
Section 338 Elections, including the determination of the ADSP and the Final
Allocation shown thereon, unless and to the extent required to do so pursuant to
a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state
or local law).

                  (e)      Purchaser shall bear the costs and expenses of
preparing the Section 338 Forms and the Proposed and Final Allocations.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                   TERMINATION

                  SECTION 11.1. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated,
and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned, prior to Closing:

                                       38

<PAGE>

                  (a)      by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

                  (b)      by Purchaser or Seller at any time if the Closing
shall not have occurred by February 15, 2004;

                  (c)      by Purchaser if there has been any material failure
on the part of Seller to comply with or perform any of its agreements, covenants
or obligations hereunder, and such noncompliance or nonperformance shall not
have been (1) cured or eliminated by Seller within ten (10) Business Days
following receipt of written notice thereof from Purchaser or (2) waived by on
or before the Closing Date;

                  (d)      by Seller if there has been any material failure on
the part of Purchaser to comply with or perform any of its agreements, covenants
or obligations hereunder and such non-compliance or nonperformance shall not
have been (1) cured or eliminated by Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days
from receipt by Purchaser of written notice thereof from Seller or (2) waived by
Seller on or before the Closing Date; or.

                  (e)      by Purchaser or Seller if the Oklahoma Department of
Insurance shall have disapproved either the (i) Purchaser's acquisition of the
Shares or (ii) the RIC (Landmark) Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement, and all
rights of appeal with respect to such disapproval shall have been exhausted.

                  (f)      The power of termination provided for in this Section
11.1 will be effective only after written notice of the party's election to
terminate (signed on behalf of the party for which it is given by a senior
officer) shall have been given to the other parties.

                  SECTION 11.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 11.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect, except that (i) the covenant with respect to confidentiality contained
in Section 12.7 shall survive forever and further (ii) in the event of such a
termination because of any breach, the breaching party shall be liable to the
other parties for all actual damages arising directly from or relating to such
breach.

Company after the Closing Date. In the event of termination of this Agreement

shall return to Seller or its Representative any confidential material in its
possession relating to the Company or destroy such confidential material and
