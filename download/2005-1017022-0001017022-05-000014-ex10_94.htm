The Property is not subject to any Leases other than the Leases described in the
certified rent roll delivered in connection with the origination of the Loan.
Such certified rent roll is true, complete and correct in all material respects
as of the date set forth therein. No Person has any possessory interest in the
Property or right to occupy the same (other than typical short-term occupancy
rights of hotel guests which are not the subject of a written agreement) except
under and pursuant to the provisions of the Leases. The current Leases are in
full force and effect and to the Best of Mezzanine Borrower's Knowledge, there
are no material defaults thereunder by either party (other than as expressly
disclosed on the certified rent roll delivered to Mezzanine Lender or the Tenant
estoppel certificates delivered to Mezzanine Lender in connection with the
closing of the Loan) and there are no conditions that, with the passage of time
or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute material defaults thereunder.
No Rent has been paid more than one (1) month in advance of its due date, except
as disclosed in the Tenant estoppel certificates delivered to Mezzanine Lender
in connection with the closing of the Loan. There has been no prior sale,
transfer or assignment, hypothecation or pledge by Mortgage Borrower of Mortgage
Borrower's interest in any Lease or of the Rents received therein, which will be
outstanding following the funding of the Loan, other than those being assigned
to Mortgage Lender concurrently herewith. No Tenant under any Lease has a right
or option pursuant to such Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any part of the
property of which the leased premises are a part. </DIV>

<U>Section 6.1</U> and <U>Section 2.5.2(h)</U>, and stating that either

Certificates of insurance with respect to all replacement policies shall be

maintain or to deliver to Mezzanine Lender the certificates of insurance
required by this Agreement or (ii) maintain and deliver originals (or
certificated copies) of such insurance policies within thirty (30) days after
the effective date thereof, upon five (5) Business Days' prior notice to
Mezzanine Borrower, Mezzanine Lender may procure such insurance, and all costs
thereof (and interest thereon at the Default Rate) shall be added to the

disapproving, accepting, preventing, obtaining or failing to obtain any

hereby expressly assumes full responsibility therefor and all liability, if any,
with respect thereto. Mezzanine Borrower agrees that any replacement insurance
policy required hereunder shall not include any so called "terrorist exclusion"
