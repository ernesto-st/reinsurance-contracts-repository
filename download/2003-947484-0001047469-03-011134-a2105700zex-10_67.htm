<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Award of Shares. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, the
Employee is hereby awarded 422,407 Restricted Shares (the "Award"), subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meanings set
forth in the Plan. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Terms and Conditions. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>It is understood and agreed that the Award of Restricted Shares evidenced hereby is subject to the
following terms and conditions: </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Vesting of Award. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Subject to Section&nbsp;2(b) below and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Award
shall become vested on the third anniversary of the date hereof. Unless otherwise provided by the Company, all dividends and other amounts receivable in connection with any adjustments to the Shares
under Section&nbsp;4(c) of the Plan shall be subject to the vesting schedule in this Section&nbsp;2(a). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Termination of Service; Forfeiture of Unvested Shares. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Except as otherwise set forth in Section&nbsp;2(a) above, in the
event the Employee ceases to be an employee of the Company prior to the date the Restricted Shares otherwise become vested (i)&nbsp;due to his death or Permanent Disability (as defined in the
Employment Agreement, among the Employee, the Company and Arch Reinsurance&nbsp;Ltd., dated as of October&nbsp;23, 2001 (the "Employment Agreement")), or (ii)&nbsp;due to termination
(A)&nbsp;by the Company not for Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or (B)&nbsp;by the Employee for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), the Restricted Shares subject
to the Award shall become vested in full at the time of such termination of service;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I> provided, however, </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>that in the case of a termination by the Company

having a fair market value equal to the amount of any income and employment taxes imposed upon vesting of the Restricted Shares shall be transferable upon such termination solely for the purpose of
funding any such income and employment taxes. For purposes of the preceding sentence, income and employment taxes shall be computed at the highest marginal rates in the jurisdictions in which the
Employee is subject to tax at the time of vesting. If the Employee ceases to be an Employee of the Company for any other reason prior to the date the Restricted Shares become vested, the Award shall
be forfeited by the Employee and become the property of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, service with any of the Company's Subsidiaries (as defined in the Plan) shall be considered to be
service with the Company. </FONT></P>
