<B><P>PREDETERMINATION OF BENEFITS:</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Plan does not require that you or your health care provider obtain precertification prior to receiving health care services or supplies nor does it provide reduced benefits if you fail to obtain precertification.&nbsp; The Plan offers a voluntary predetermination program that you or your health care provider may use to determine whether the Plan considers health care services or supplies that have not yet been provided to you to be medically necessary&nbsp;and appropriate.&nbsp; If you participate in this voluntary predetermination program and a service or supply is determined to be medically necessary and appropriate, when your claim is submitted after the service or supply is&nbsp;provided, your claim will not be denied on the basis of medical necessity and appropriateness.&nbsp; There is no penalty for failure to request a predetermination.&nbsp; However, if you receive health care services or supplies without obtaining a predetermination, you risk learning after receiving the services or supplies, that they are not covered under the Plan because they are not considered medically necessary and appropriate.&nbsp; <B>Unless you obtain a predetermination, medical necessity will be decided when a claim is filed after the service or supply has been provided.&nbsp; In such a case, you may be entirely responsible for the cost of any non-covered services or supplies.&nbsp; </B>To predetermine whether a hospitalization or a surgical procedure or other outpatient procedure is considered medically necessary and appropriate, contact Benefit Consultants, Inc. at (800) 434-4620.&nbsp; BCI may refer your request to an independent medical consultant to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of the service.&nbsp; You and your physician will be informed of the decision</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CLAIMS PROCEDURES FOR MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS:&nbsp; </B>Providers of medical and dental services and supplies may file claims in writing or electronically with the Administrative Manager (via the managed care organization in which the providers participate, if applicable).&nbsp; Claims filed by Participants for reimbursement of medical and dental expenses must be filed in writing with the Administrative Manager.&nbsp; Medicare Explanation of Benefit forms must accompany medical claims submitted on behalf of Medicare Retirees.&nbsp; Claims must include a claim form prescribed by the Benefits Committee.&nbsp; Claim forms may be obtained from the Administrative Manager or from the Human Resources office of Paul Mueller Company.&nbsp; The Committee may, at its own expense, require an independent medical examination to be performed by a Physician selected by the Committee.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A request for predetermination is not a claim.&nbsp; To file a claim under this Plan, there must be a written request for payment of services or supplies that have already been provided to you.&nbsp; If a request is made to extend a course of treatment beyond the period of time or number of treatments previously approved, the request must be made to the Administrative Manager in writing and the request will be treated as a request for predetermination.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Affirmative proof of claim must be furnished to the Administrative Manager within 12 months following the&nbsp;date the Covered Expense on which the claim is based was incurred.&nbsp; Failure to furnish proof of claim&nbsp;within the time required above will not invalidate or reduce any claim if it is shown not to have been reasonably possible to furnish such proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as possible thereafter.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Medical and Dental Benefits provided under the Plan for Covered Expenses with respect to which a health care provider has allowed a discount to the Plan, in accordance with a discount agreement between the provider and the Benefits Committee, will be paid directly to the Hospital, Physician or Dentist.&nbsp; All other Medical and Dental Benefits will be paid to you (or to a custodial parent pursuant to the terms of&nbsp;a Qualified Medical Child Support Order), except that you may assign payment of Benefits directly to the Hospital, Physician, or other person or institution rendering services or furnishing supplies for which Benefits are payable under the Plan.&nbsp; The Committee is not required to inquire into the validity of any such assignment, and any payment made in good faith by the Committee discharges the obligation of the Committee to the extent of such payment.&nbsp; The Plan will also honor any assignment of rights made by or on your behalf as required by Medicaid.&nbsp; In addition, if Medicaid makes payments which this Plan has a legal liability to make, the Plan will reimburse Medicaid for those payments, but only to the extent it is required to do so by State statute.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any unassigned Medical and Dental Benefits for services rendered, that are unpaid at your death will be paid to the Beneficiary you designated under your Life Insurance under the Plan.&nbsp; If you are incompetent, any unassigned Medical and Dental Benefits payable during your lifetime will be paid to your Life Insurance Beneficiary or, if you have not designated one, to the person or institution who is caring for you.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Administrative Manager will make a decision with respect to a claim for Medical and Dental Benefits within 30 days after receipt of the claim, unless matters beyond the control of the plan require an extension of time for processing.&nbsp; If such an extension of time is required, written notice of the extension will be&nbsp;sent to the claimant prior to termination of the 30-day period.&nbsp; The extension notice will indicate the  circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a final decision.&nbsp; In no event will this date be more than 15 days after the end of the initial 30-day period.&nbsp; If the extension of time is necessary due to the claimant's failure to submit all the information necessary to decide the claim, the claimant will be notified of the additional information needed and will be given 45 days to provide the information.&nbsp; (The Plan's time limits are tolled while the Plan is waiting for you to provide the information.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, but not by way of limitation, if this Plan pays a claim of yours and the Benefits Committee later determines that the claim was for an expense not covered under this Plan, then the Committee is entitled to recover the payment from you, a member of your family that is also covered under the Plan, and/or the person who provided your treatment, in any combination.&nbsp; Alternatively, the Committee may set off the amount of the payment from amounts the Plan owes in&nbsp;the future to you, your covered family member, and/or the provider, in any combination.&nbsp; This same rule applies if the Plan pays a claim for a covered expense, but the amount paid exceeds the amount required to be paid under the Plan.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These restitution and set-off provisions apply, among other circumstances, where the Plan pays covered expenses incurred for treatment of an injury or illness for which any other person or plan is or may be liable, and where the Plan's subrogation provision (as described above) does not provide the Plan with a right to recover amounts it paid or pays.&nbsp; If the other person or plan, the other person or plan's insurer, or anyone else on behalf of the other person or plan makes payment to you or on your behalf as compensation for the your injury or illness, and this Plan is not subrogated with respect to the payment, the Plan is entitled to restitution or set-off in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the benefits paid by this Plan for treatment of the injury or illness, or (b) the amount paid to you or on your behalf by the other person or plan.&nbsp; These restitution and set-off provisions are inapplicable where the other person or plan is a medical plan with respect to which this Plan, pursuant to its coordination of benefits provisions, is the primary payer of the covered person's allowable expenses.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, where another person or plan pays compensation to you or on your behalf for an injury or illness for which the other person or plan is or may be liable, and you incur (either before or after payment of such compensation) otherwise covered expenses for treatment of the injury or illness, a special rule applies.&nbsp; In that case, any otherwise covered expenses that are incurred after the date on which the compensation was paid, or that were incurred before that date but not yet paid by the Plan as of that date, shall be excluded from coverage under the Plan (and therefore not paid by the Plan), to the extent that the amount of compensation you or your dependent receives exceeds the amount of covered expenses the Plan has already paid for treatment of the your injury or illness.&nbsp; </P>

In other words, the Plan's recovery right is not limited by the "make whole" doctrine sometimes applicable in other contexts.&nbsp; </P>
