Only  Indebtedness  of  the  Company  that  is  Senior  Debt  shall  rank  senior  to  the  Notes.   Each  holder  of  a  Note  agrees,  if  requested  by  the  Senior  Lender  to  execute  a  Subordination  Agreement  for  the  benefit  of  the  Senior  Lender  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  this  Section 17.1.                                      27  </FONT></DIV>

These  subordination  provisions  are  and  are  intended  solely  for  the  purpose  of  defining  the relative rights  of each holder  of a  Note  on  the  one  hand  and  the  holders  of  Senior Debt on the other hand.  Nothing contained herein or elsewhere in this Agreement or  in the Notes is intended to or shall (a) impair, as between the Company and each holder of a  Note, the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay to each  holder of a Note the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes as and when the  same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, (b) affect the relative  rights against the Company and each holder of a Note and creditors of the Company other  than their rights in relation to the holders of Senior Debt or (c) prevent the holder of a Note  from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this  Agreement, including filing and voting claims in any Proceeding, subject to the rights, if  any, of the holders of Senior Debt to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable  or deliverable to the holder.   17.6.  No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.           No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination  as  herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or  failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any  such  holder,  or  by  any  noncompliance  by  the  Company  with  the  terms,  provisions  and  covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof that the holder may have  or be otherwise charged with.

Notice to Holders.           The Company shall give prompt written notice to the holder of a Note of any fact  known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment in respect of the  Notes.                                      30  </FONT></DIV>
