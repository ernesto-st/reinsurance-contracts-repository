Borrower;</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested certain amendments to the Existing Credit Agreement as
more fully set forth herein;</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2. <U>Amendments</U>. Effective as of the date on which all the conditions precedent
set forth in Section&nbsp;7 of this Amendment shall be satisfied (such date, the &#147;<U>Fourth Amendment
Effective Date</U>&#148;), the Existing Credit Agreement, including all exhibits and schedules thereto,
shall be amended to read in its entirety as set forth in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> to this Amendment.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 3. <U>Lender Addendum</U>. By executing this Amendment on or prior to the Fourth

Credit Loans made by the Revolving Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving
Commitments in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;2.5. Each Canadian Revolving
Loan shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;2.6. The failure of any
Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of
its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible
for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender).
The Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be (i)&nbsp;in the case of LIBOR Loans (other than LIBOR
Canadian Revolving Loans), in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of
$5,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000 and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of ABR Loans or FFR Loans, in an
aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $5,000,000
(or if less, an aggregate principal amount equal to the remaining balance of the available Total
Revolving Commitment). Canadian Revolving Loans (x)&nbsp;denominated in Canadian Dollars shall be in a
principal amount that is an integral multiple of C$500,000 and not less than C$1,000,000 and (y)
denominated in Dollars shall be in a principal amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and

FFR Loans, as the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower may request pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.5. Each
Canadian Revolving Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars shall be a Canadian B/A or a Canadian Prime
Rate Loan. Each Canadian Revolving Loan denominated in Dollars shall be a LIBOR Loan or a Canadian
ABR Loan. Each Lender may at its option make any LIBOR Loan by causing any domestic or foreign
branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan, <U>provided</U> that any exercise of such
option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower or such Subsidiary Borrower to repay such
Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Interest Rate
Type may be outstanding at the same time; <U>provided</U> that neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary Borrower shall be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in an
aggregate of more than 15 separate Loans of any Lender being outstanding hereunder at any one time.
For purposes of the calculation required by the immediately preceding sentence, LIBOR Loans having
different Interest Periods or having been made in different Currencies, regardless of whether they
commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Loans and all Loans of a single Interest
Rate Type made on a single date shall be considered a single Loan if such Loans have a common
Interest Period.

ABR Loans and 4:00 P.M. Local Time in the case of ABR Loans, FFR Loans, Canadian Prime Rate Loans
and Canadian ABR Loans, in each case, in immediately available funds. Upon receipt of the funds to
be made available by the Lenders to fund any Borrowing hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall
disburse such funds by depositing them into an account of the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary
Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent. Revolving Credit Loans shall be made by all the
Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.1 and this Section&nbsp;2.2. Canadian Revolving
Loans shall be made by the Canadian Revolving Lender in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.1 and this

Period with respect to any Borrowing of LIBOR Revolving Credit Loans is specified in any such

hereof, each Revolving Issuing Lender agrees to issue Revolving Letters of Credit payable in
Dollars from time to time after the Closing Date and prior to the earlier of the Termination Date
and the termination of the Revolving Commitments, upon the request of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary Borrower (other than the Canadian Subsidiary Borrower), <U>provided</U> that (A)&nbsp;the
Borrower or applicable Subsidiary Borrower shall not request that any Revolving Letter of Credit be
issued if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the then current Revolving L/C Exposure plus the
aggregate principal amount of the Loans then outstanding (other than Canadian Revolving Loans)
would exceed the Total Revolving Commitment, (B)&nbsp;in no event shall any Revolving Issuing Lender
issue (x)&nbsp;any Revolving Letter of Credit having an expiration date later than five Business Days
before the Termination Date or (y)&nbsp;any Revolving Letter of Credit having an expiration date more
than one year after its date of issuance, <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that any Revolving
Letter of Credit with a 365-day duration may provide for the renewal thereof for additional
one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (x)&nbsp;above),
(C)&nbsp;neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary Borrower shall request that a Revolving Issuing Lender
issue any Revolving Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, the Revolving L/C
Exposure would exceed $200,000,000 prior to the Non-Extended Termination Date and $50,000,000 (and
if on the Non-Extended Termination Date the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds $50,000,000 the Borrower
shall deposit cash or Cash Equivalents in a Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to 103% of
such excess to be held as cash collateral by the Administrative Agent until such excess no longer
exists, at which time the Administrative Agent shall return all such collateral to the Borrower)
thereafter, and (D)&nbsp;a Revolving Issuing Lender shall be prohibited from issuing or renewing

Revolving Issuing Lender, provide that such Revolving Issuing Lender may (but shall
not be required to) pay all or any part of the maximum amount which may at any time
be available for drawing thereunder to the beneficiary thereof upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default and the acceleration of the maturity of the Revolving Credit
Loans, <U>provided</U> that, if payment is not then due to such beneficiary, such
Revolving Issuing Lender shall deposit the funds in question in an account with such
Revolving Issuing Lender to secure payment to such beneficiary and any funds so
deposited shall be paid to such beneficiary of such Revolving Letter of Credit if
conditions to such payment are satisfied or returned to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to the Revolving Lenders (or, if all Obligations shall have been paid
in full in cash, to the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary Borrower) if no
payment to such beneficiary has been made and the final date available for drawings
under such Revolving Letter of Credit has passed. Each payment or deposit of funds
by a Revolving Issuing Lender as provided in this paragraph shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as a drawing duly honored by such Revolving Issuing
Lender under the related Revolving Letter of Credit.

outstanding Letters of Credit shall be reallocated among the Lenders so that after
giving effect thereto the Extending Revolving Lenders and the Non-Extending
Revolving Lenders shall share ratably in the L/C Exposure thereunder in accordance
with the respective Revolving Credit Percentages of the Revolving Lenders after
giving effect to the reductions in Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 5(a) of
the Fourth Amendment (including both the Extended Revolving Commitments and the
Non-Extended Revolving Commitments thereunder from time to time in effect) as if
there were a single tranche of Revolving Commitments. Thereafter until the
Non-Extended Termination Date, the participations in any new Letters of Credit shall
be allocated in accordance with the respective Revolving Credit Percentages of the
Revolving Lenders. On the Non-Extended Termination Date, the participations in the
outstanding Letters of Credit of the Non-Extending Revolving Lenders (other than in
respect of then outstanding unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit) shall, if
no Default or Event of Default exists, be reallocated to and among the Extending
Revolving Lenders ratably in accordance with their Extended Revolving Commitments
(and the Non-Extending Revolving Lenders shall be released from their participation
obligations in undrawn Letters of Credit if no Default or Event of Default then
exists) but in any case, only to the extent the sum of the amount of the Revolving
Credit Loans and L/C Exposure of all Extending Revolving Lenders before giving
effect to such reallocation plus the participations in the outstanding Letters of
Credit of the Non-Extending Revolving Lenders being reallocated does not exceed the
Total Extended Revolving Commitment.

partially, be effected as a result of the limitations set forth therein, the
Borrower shall promptly repay Revolving Credit Loans so that, after giving effect to
such repayment, the aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Loans and aggregate L/C
Exposure does not exceed the Total Extended Revolving Commitment, in each case, for
so long as any Letters of Credit are outstanding.

due hereunder in one currency into another currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent
that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance
with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the relevant Lender (or agent acting on
its behalf) or the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency
for the first currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is
given.

any judgment in a currency (the &#147;<U>Judgment Currency</U>&#148;) other than that in which such sum is
denominated in accordance with this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Agreement Currency</U>&#148;), be discharged
only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by any Lender (or agent acting on
its behalf) (the &#147;<U>Applicable Creditor</U>&#148;) of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment
Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant
jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in
the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such
judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss, <U>provided</U>, that if the
amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Applicable
Creditor, the Applicable Creditor agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower. The obligations of
the Borrower contained in this Section&nbsp;10.15 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
the Commitments, the expiration of the Letters of Credit and the payment of all amounts owing
hereunder. Each Borrower shall repay each Loan made to it, and interest thereon, in the Currency
in which such Loan is denominated.
