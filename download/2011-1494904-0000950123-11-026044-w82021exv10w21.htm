</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This retention agreement, dated March&nbsp;15, 2011 (this &#147;Agreement&#148;), is made by and between Wind
River Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (the &#147;Employer&#148;) and Troy W. Santora (the &#147;Employee&#148;). Capitalized
terms used but not concurrently defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Sections&nbsp;2 and
4 below.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>1. Qualifying Period Employment</B>. Subject to Section&nbsp;2 below, the Employee agrees to remain
employed by the Employer for the Qualifying Period. Nothing in this Agreement alters or modifies
the Employee&#146;s employment relationship with the Employer. This Agreement does not constitute an
agreement by the Employer to continue to employ the Employee during the entire, or any portion of
the, term of this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>2. Payment of Bonus</B>. If eligible, the Employee will receive the Bonus on the first regular pay
date following the end of the Qualifying Period. Subject to the provisions of the following
paragraph, payment of the Bonus is contingent upon the Employee&#146;s continued employment with the
Employer for the entire Qualifying Period. Payment of the Bonus is also subject to all applicable
payroll withholdings and deductions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If the Employee&#146;s employment with the Employer terminates before the end of the Qualifying Period
for any reason, including, without limitation, the death or disability of the Employee, other than
solely resulting from (a)&nbsp;the Employee&#146;s resignation with Good Reason or (b)&nbsp;the termination of the
Employee&#146;s employment without Cause, the Employee will not earn and will not be entitled to receive
the Bonus (or any portion thereof), and the Employer shall have no further obligations under this
Agreement. However, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee&#146;s
employment terminates before the end of the Qualifying Period because the Employee resigns for Good
Reason or because the Employee&#146;s employment has been terminated without Cause, the Employee will be
entitled to the payment of the Bonus on the first regular pay date following the end of the
Qualifying Period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solely for purposes of determining the Employee&#146;s Bonus eligibility under the terms of
this Agreement:

notice to the Employee of a condition constituting Cause has been delivered by the Employer to the
Employee and such condition remains uncured by the Employee for at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days after
receipt of such notice; <U>provided</U> <U>further</U> <U>that</U> any condition otherwise
constituting Cause hereunder that is described under clauses (i)&nbsp;through (iv)&nbsp;below shall only
constitute Cause to the extent it is reasonably expected to have a material adverse economic impact
on the Employer and Global Indemnity plc (the &#147;Company&#148;) and the Company&#146;s controlled affiliates on
a consolidated basis: (i)&nbsp;the engaging by the Employee in any fraud, dishonesty or gross misconduct
adverse to the interests of the Employer or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; (ii)&nbsp;the
material violation by the Employee of any restrictive covenants contained in the Employee&#146;s
employment agreement (if any) with the Employer as of the date hereof or as it may be amended (the
&#147;Employment Agreement&#148;) or any other agreement with the Employer or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates to which the Employee is a party; (iii)&nbsp;a breach by the Employee of any
material representation or warranty made in the Employee&#146;s Employment Agreement or any other
agreement with the

the internal appeal process provided for in Rule&nbsp;34 of the JAMS rules with respect to any initial
judgment rendered in an arbitration. Any such arbitration proceeding shall take place in

agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages and
waive, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, any right to recover such damages in such
arbitration. Each party shall each bear their respective costs (including attorneys&#146; fees, and
there shall be no award of attorney&#146;s fees) and shall split the fees and expenses of the
arbitrator. Judgment upon the final award rendered by such arbitrator, after giving effect to the

Association shall be substituted for JAMS for the purposes of the foregoing provisions. Each party

confidentiality in respect to any dispute between them under this Agreement.
