If the inclusion of any provision in this Article causes a state insurance
commissioner or other legal authority to prohibit the Company from taking credit

considered void.



                               SPECIAL PROVISIONS

At any time subsequent to the inception of this Contract:

A. should the ownership, control or management of the Company or the Reinsurer
be altered or changed, in whole or in part, in such a way that receipt or
payment of funds or any other contemplated transaction under this Contract would
be prohibited by United States of America statute, regulation and/or other

                          EXTRA CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

A.   This Contract shall indemnify the Company, within the limits of this
     Contract, for extra contractual obligations awarded by a court of competent
     jurisdiction against the Company arising from the Surety business reinsured
     hereunder. Such extra contractual obligation will be added to the amount of
     the loss within the Company's Bond limit and the sum thereof will be
     considered one loss subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth in
     this Contract.

B.   "Extra contractual obligations" are defined as those damages for which the
     Company is liable to pay that are not covered under any other provision of
     this Contract including but not limited to compensatory, punitive damages
     and related expenses that are assessed against the Company because of
     alleged or actual bad faith or negligence on its part in the handling of
     any claim on the business reinsured hereunder brought by any principal,
     indemnitor, obligee or claimant (hereinafter referred to in this definition
     as "Principal") for which a contractual loss has been incurred by the
     Company.

C.   The date on which an extra contractual obligation is incurred by the
     Company shall be deemed, in all circumstances, to be the date such extra
     contractual obligation claim combined with the underlying contractual claim
     meets the definition of loss discovered, as defined herein; it being
     understood that such extra contractual obligation claim is directly related
     to an underlying contractual claim. For the purposes of this Article,
     "underlying contractual claim" will mean any claim made on business covered
     hereunder and for which a loss has been incurred by the Company.

D.   However, coverage hereunder as respects extra contractual obligations will
     not apply where the loss has been incurred due to the fraud of a member of
     the Board of Directors or a corporate officer of the Company or a Company
     employee with claim settlement authority acting individually or
     collectively or in collusion with any individual or corporation or any
     other organization or party involved in the presentation, defense or
     settlement of any surety claim covered hereunder nor shall it apply to
     non-claim related expenses.

E.   Recoveries, collectibles or retention from any other form of insurance or
     reinsurance including, but not limited to, deductibles or self-insured
     retention which protect the Company against extra contractual obligations
     will inure to the benefit of the Reinsurer and will be deducted from the
     total amount of extra contractual obligations for purposes of determining
     the loss hereunder.

F.   Extra contractual obligations shall not include losses arising solely out
     of any non-claim activity including but not limited to underwriting
     decisions of the Company, engineering or other services provided by the
     Company.

                                INTEREST PENALTY

The interest amounts provided for in this Article will apply to the Reinsurer or
to the Company in the following circumstances:

     1.  Loss payment owed by the Reinsurer to the Company will have a due date
         to the Company of 90 calendar days following the date of the
         billing/proof of loss.

     2.  Payment of any premium will be due to the Reinsurer within 90 calendar
         days of the date specified in this Contract. Any premium adjustments
         will be due by the debtor party within 150 calendar days of the expiry
         of this Contract.

     3.  Payment on return of premiums, commissions, profit sharing, or any
         amounts not provided in paragraphs 1. or 2. above, will have the due
         date as specified in this Contract. If no due date is specified, the
         due date will be 90 days following the date of billing.

     4.  Failure by the Reinsurer or Company to comply with their respective
         payment obligations within the time periods as herein provided will
         result in a compound interest penalty payable at a rate equal to the 90
         day Treasury Bill rate as published in the Money Rate Section or any
         successor section of The Wall Street Journal on the first business day
         following the date a remittance becomes due, plus 1% per annum, to be
         compounded and adjusted quarterly. Any interest which occurs pursuant
         to this Article will be calculated by the party to which it is owed.
         The accumulation of the number of days that any payment is past due
         will stop on the date that the Intermediary, where applicable, receives
         payment.

     5.  The validity of any claim or payment may be contested under the
         provisions of this Contract. If the debtor party prevails in
         arbitration or any other proceeding, there will be no interest penalty
         due. Otherwise, any interest will be calculated and due as outlined
         above.

     6.  If a Reinsurer advances payment of any claim it is contesting, and
         prevails in the contest, the Company will return such payment plus pay
         interest on same, calculated as per the provisions of this Article.

     7.  Any interest which occurs pursuant to this Article may be waived by the
         party to which it is owed. Further, any interest which is calculated
         pursuant to this Article that is $100 or less will be waived. Waiver of
         such interest, however, will not affect the waiving party's right to
         similar interest for any other failure by the other party to make
         payment when due under this Article.

     8.  Nothing in this Article will diminish any legal remedies which either
         party may have against the other.
