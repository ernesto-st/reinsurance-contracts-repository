Prime Rate Loans or LIBO Loans as the Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers may request (which request shall substantially be made in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit C</U>) subject to and in accordance with this SECTION 2.04. All Swingline
Loans shall be only Prime Rate Loans. All Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, be Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type. Each Lender may fulfill its Commitment with
respect to any Revolving Credit Loan by causing any lending office of such Lender to make such Revolving Credit Loan; <I>provided, however,</I> that any such use of a lending office shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such
Revolving Credit Loan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Revolving Credit Note. Each Lender shall, subject to its overall policy considerations, use reasonable efforts to select a lending office which will not result in the payment of
increased costs by the Borrowers. Subject to the other provisions of this SECTION 2.04 and the provisions of SECTION 2.10 and SECTION 2.11, Borrowings of Revolving Credit Loans of more than one Type may be incurred at the same time[<STRIKE>, but in

Prime Rate Loans by the Borrowers on the same Business Day requested for such Borrowing. Any such notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the second Business Day in the case of LIBO Loans,
and not later than 1:00 p.m. on the same Business Day in the case of Prime Rate Loans, prior to or on, as the case may be, the date on which such Borrowing is to be made. Such notice shall be irrevocable (except to the extent set forth in SECTION
2.10 or SECTION 2.11 hereof), shall contain disbursement instructions and shall specify: (i)&nbsp;whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans or LIBO Loans and, if LIBO Loans, the Interest Period with respect
thereto; (ii)&nbsp;the amount of the proposed Borrowing (which shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000, but not less than $5,000,000 in the case of LIBO Loans); and (iii)&nbsp;the date of the proposed Borrowing (which shall be a Business
Day). If no election of Interest Period is specified in any such notice for a Borrowing of LIBO Loans, such notice shall be deemed a request for an Interest Period of one (1)&nbsp;month. If no election is made as to the Type of Revolving Credit
Loan, such notice shall be deemed a request for Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its proportionate share of such Borrowing, the date of such Borrowing, the Type of Borrowing being requested
and the Interest Period or Interest Periods applicable thereto, as appropriate. On the borrowing date specified in such notice, each Lender shall make its share of the Borrowing available at the office of the Administrative Agent at 100 Federal
Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110 (or such other place as the Administrative Agent may request) no later than 3:00 p.m., in immediately available funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed
date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#146;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
this SECTION 2.04 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In the event a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, with interest thereon for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to

not charge amounts owing in respect of Other Liabilities to the Loan Account to the extent that an Overadvance may result thereby. The Administrative Agent shall advise the Lead Borrower of any such advance or charge promptly after the making
thereof. Such action on the part of the Administrative Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent&#146;s rights and the Borrowers&#146; obligations under SECTION 2.17(a) or SECTION 2.17(b). Any amount which is added to the
principal balance of the Loan Account as provided in this SECTION 2.04(d) shall bear interest at the interest rate then and thereafter applicable to Prime Rate Loans determined by reference to the Prime Rate. </P>

Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations after the termination
of all Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Collateral Agent, each Secured Party and the other Credit Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or
more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any other Loan Party, or exercise any
other right or remedy available to them against any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Loan Party hereunder except to the extent that all the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and
performed in full after the termination of Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document. Pursuant to, and to the fullest extent permitted by, Applicable Law, each Loan Party waives any defense arising out of any such election even though
such election operates, pursuant to Applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Loan Party against any other Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security. To the fullest

herein, each Loan Party is obligated to repay the Obligations as joint and several obligors under this Agreement. Upon payment by any Loan Party of any Obligations, all rights of such Loan Party against any other Loan Party arising as a result
thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations (other than contingent
indemnity obligations for then unasserted claims) and the termination of all Commitments to any Loan Party under any Loan Document. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Loan Party on account of (i)&nbsp;such subrogation, contribution,
reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii)&nbsp;any such indebtedness of any Loan Party, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against
the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that any Loan Party shall, under this Agreement as a joint and several
obligor, repay any of the Obligations constituting Loans made to another Loan Party hereunder (an &#147;<U>Accommodation Payment</U>&#148;), then the Loan Party making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification
from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Loan Parties in an amount equal to a fraction of such Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other Loan Party&#146;s Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum of
the Allocable Amounts of all of the Loan Parties; provided that such rights of contribution and indemnification shall be subordinated to the prior payment in full, in cash, of all of the Obligations. As of any date of determination, the
&#147;<U>Allocable Amount</U>&#148; of each Loan Party shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments which could be asserted against such Loan Party hereunder without (a)&nbsp;rendering such Loan Party

Loan Party unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section&nbsp;548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section&nbsp;4 of the UFTA, or Section&nbsp;5 of the UFCA. </P>
