Section 2.    AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS AND LOANS

       2.1    Commitments; Making of Loans; Optional Notes.

              A.   Commitments.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties
of Borrower herein set forth, each Lender hereby severally agrees
to make the Loans as described in subsections 2.1A(i), 2.1A(ii)
and 2.1A(iii).

              (i)  Tranche A Term Loans.  Borrower acknowledges that
     Tranche A Term Loans in an aggregate amount of $40,000,000 were
     advanced to Borrower on the Original Closing Date.  The aggregate
     amount of the Tranche A Term Loans currently outstanding is $37,750,000;
     provided that the Tranche A Term Loan Commitments of Lenders
     shall be adjusted to give effect to (1) any assignments of the
     Tranche A Term Loan Commitments pursuant to subsection 10.1B and
     (2) any increase in Tranche A Term Loans pursuant to subsection
     2.1A(iv).  Amounts borrowed under subsection 2.1A(i) of the
     Existing Credit Agreement and subsequently repaid may not be
     reborrowed.

              (ii)  Tranche B Term Loans.  Borrower acknowledges that
     Tranche B Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to $45,000,000 were
     advanced to Borrower on the Original Closing Date (of which
     $44,775,000 remains outstanding) and only $135,000,000 of Tranche
     B Term Loans will be advanced to Borrower on the Effective Date.
     Each Lender that has an unfunded Tranche B Term Loan Commitment
     severally agrees to lend to Borrower on the Effective Date an
     amount not exceeding its Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount
     of the Tranche B Term Loan Commitment to be funded on the
     Effective Date to be used for the purposes identified in
     subsection 2.5A.  Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent
     a Notice of Borrowing no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City
     time) at least one Business Day prior to the Effective Date,
     requesting a borrowing of the unfunded Tranche B Term Loans.  The
     Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the proposed Funding Date
     (which shall be a Business Day), and (ii) that such Loans shall
     be Base Rate Loans.  The aggregate amount of the Tranche B Term
     Loan Commitments is $179,775,000; provided that the Tranche B
     Term Loan Commitments of Lenders shall be adjusted to (1) give
     effect to any assignments of the Tranche B Term Loan Commitments
     pursuant to subsection 10.1B and (2) any increase in Tranche B
     Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iv).  Each Lender's
     unfunded Tranche B Term Loan Commitment shall expire immediately
     and without further action on November 25, 2002 if the unfunded
     Tranche B Term Loans have not been made on or before that date.
     Subject to subsection 2.1A(iv), Borrower may make only one
     borrowing under the unfunded Tranche B Term Loan Commitments.
     Amounts borrowed under this subsection 2.1A(ii) or previously
     borrowed under the corresponding section in the Existing Credit
     Agreement and subsequently repaid or prepaid may not be
     reborrowed.

              (iii) Revolving Loans.  Each Lender severally agrees,
     subject to the limitations set forth below with respect to the
     maximum amount of Revolving Loans permitted to be outstanding from
     time to time, to lend to Borrower from time to time after the
     Effective Date to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
     Termination Date an aggregate amount not exceeding its Pro Rata
     Share of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments
     to be used for the purposes identified in subsection 2.5B.  The
     aggregate original amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments is
     $45,000,000; provided that the amount of the Revolving Loan
     Commitments shall be reduced from time to time by the amount of
     any reductions thereto made pursuant to subsection 2.4B; and
     provided further that the Revolving Loan Commitments of Lenders
     shall be adjusted to give effect to (1) any increase in Revolving
     Loan Commitments pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iv), and (2) any
     assignments of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to
     subsection 10.1B.  Each Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment shall
     expire immediately and without further action on the Revolving
     Loan Commitment Termination Date and all Revolving Loans and all
     other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Revolving Loans
     and the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be paid in full no later
     than that date; provided that each Lender's Revolving Loan
     Commitment shall expire immediately and without further action on
     November 25, 2002 if the Tranche A Term Loans have not been made
     on or before that date.  Amounts borrowed under this subsection
     2.1A(iii) may be repaid and reborrowed to but excluding the
     Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date.

Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Revolving Loans and the Revolving Loan
Commitments shall be subject to the limitation that in no event
shall the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments at any
time exceed the lesser of the Revolving Loan Commitments then in
effect and the Borrowing Base then in effect.

              (iv) Increases of the Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments.

                   (a)  At the mutual discretion of Borrower and Lead Arranger,
              Borrower may request in writing at any time during the period
              from the Effective Date to and including the second anniversary
              of the Effective Date that (x) the then effective aggregate
              principal amount of any existing Type or Types of Term Loans be
              increased, and/or (y) the then effective aggregate principal
              amount of Revolving Loan Commitments be increased; provided that
              (1) the aggregate principal amount of the increases in Term Loans
              and/or Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to this subsection
              2.1A(iv) shall not exceed $45,000,000 in the aggregate, (2)
              Borrower may not make more than three requests for such increases
              in Term Loans and/or Revolving Loan Commitments and (3) no Event
              of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and
              be continuing or occur as a result of such increases in Term
              Loans and/or Revolving Loan Commitments.  Any request under this
              subsection 2.1A(iv) shall be submitted by Borrower to
              Administrative Agent (which shall promptly forward copies to
              Lenders), specify the proposed effective date and amount of such
              increase and be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate
              certifying that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default
              exists or will occur as a result of such increase.  Borrower
              shall specify any fees offered to those Lenders (the "Increasing
              Lenders") that agree to increase the principal amount of their
              applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case
              may be, which fees may be variable based upon the amount by which
              any such Lender is willing to increase the principal amount of
              its applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitment, as the
              case may be.  No Lender shall have any obligation, express or
              implied, to offer to increase the aggregate principal amount of
              its applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitment, as the
              case may be.  Only the consent of each Increasing Lender shall be
              required for an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the
              applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case
              may be, pursuant to this subsection 2.1A(iv).  No Lender that
              elects not to increase the principal amount of its Term Loan or
              Revolving Loan Commitment, as the case may be, may be replaced in
              respect of its existing applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan
              Commitment, as the case may be, as a result thereof without such
              Lender's consent.

                   (b)  Each Increasing Lender shall as soon as practicable
              specify the amount of the proposed increase that it is willing to
              assume. Borrower may accept some or all of the offered amounts or
              designate new lenders that qualify as Eligible Assignees and that
              are reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent as additional
              Lenders hereunder in accordance with this subsection 2.1A(iv)
              (each such new lender being a "New Lender"), which New Lender may
              assume all or a portion of the increase in the aggregate
              principal amount of the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan
              Commitments, as the case may be.  Borrower and Administrative
              Agent shall have discretion jointly to adjust the allocation of
              the increased aggregate principal amount of the applicable Term
              Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case may be, among
              Increasing Lenders and New Lenders.

                   (c)  Each New Lender designated by Borrower and reasonably
              acceptable to Administrative Agent shall become an additional
              party hereto as a New Lender concurrently with the effectiveness
              of the proposed increase in the aggregate principal amount of the
              applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments.

                   (d)  Subject to the foregoing, any increase requested by
              Borrower shall be effective upon delivery to Administrative Agent
              of each of the following documents:  (i) an originally executed
              copy of an Instrument of Joinder signed by a duly authorized
              officer of each New Lender, substantially in the form attached
              hereto as Exhibit XXIII-A; (ii) a notice to the Increasing
              Lenders and New Lenders, substantially in the form attached hereto
              as Exhibit XXIII-B, signed by a duly authorized officer of
              Borrower; (iii) an Officer's Certificate of Borrower,
              substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit XXIII-C; and
              (iv) any other certificates or documents that Administrative Agent
              shall reasonably request, in form and substance satisfactory to
              Administrative Agent and shall be in the principal amount equal
              to (A) the principal amount that Increasing Lenders are willing
              to assume as increases to the principal amount of their
              applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case
              may be, plus (B) the principal amount offered by New Lenders with
              respect to the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan
              Commitments, as the case may be, in either case as adjusted by
              Borrower and Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection
              2.1A(iv).  Upon effectiveness of any such increase, the Pro Rata
              Share of each Lender will be adjusted to give effect to the
              increase in the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Loan
              Commitments, as the case may be.  To the extent that the
              adjustment of Pro Rata Shares results in losses or expenses to
              any Lender as a result of the prepayment of any LIBOR Loan on a
              date other than the scheduled last day of the applicable Interest
              Period, Borrower shall be responsible for such losses or expenses
              pursuant to subsection 2.6D.

        B.   Borrowing Mechanics.  Except for Revolving Loans made on the
Effective Date, Revolving Loans made on any Funding Date shall be
in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples
of $100,000 in excess of that amount; provided that Revolving
Loans made on any Funding Date as LIBOR Loans with a particular
Interest Period shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of
$1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that
amount.  Whenever Borrower desires that Lenders make Revolving
Loans it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of
Borrowing no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least
three Business Days in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in
the case of a LIBOR Loan) or no later than 10:00 a.m. on the
proposed Funding Date (in the case of a Base Rate Loan).  The
Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the proposed Funding Date
(which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the amount and Type of
Loans requested, (iii) in the case of any Loans made on the
Effective Date, that such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans, (iv) in
the case of Revolving Loans not made on the Effective Date,
whether such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans,
(v) in the case of any Loans requested to be made as LIBOR Loans,
the initial Interest Period requested therefor, and (vi)
information about the account of Borrower to be credited.
Revolving Loans may be continued as or converted into Base Rate
Loans and LIBOR Loans in the manner provided in subsection 2.2D.
In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of Borrowing for
any Loan, Borrower may give Administrative Agent  telephonic
notice by the required time of any proposed borrowing under this
subsection 2.1B; provided that such notice shall be promptly
confirmed in writing by delivery of a Notice of Borrowing to
Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office no later
than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date such notice was
given.

              Neither Administrative Agent, nor any Lender shall
incur any liability to Borrower in acting upon any telephonic
notice referred to above that Administrative Agent believes in
good faith to have been given by a duly authorized Officer or
other person authorized to borrow on behalf of Borrower or for
otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.1B, and
upon funding of Revolving Loans by Lenders in accordance with
this Agreement pursuant to any such telephonic notice Borrower
shall have effected Revolving Loans hereunder.

              Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent prior to the
funding of any Revolving Loans if any of the matters to which
Borrower is required to certify in the applicable Notice of
Borrowing is no longer true and correct as of the applicable
Funding Date, and the acceptance by Borrower of the proceeds of
any Revolving Loans shall constitute a re-certification by
Borrower, as of the applicable Funding Date, as to the matters to
which Borrower is required to certify in the applicable Notice of
Borrowing.

              Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C
and 2.6G, a Notice of Borrowing for a LIBOR Loan (or telephonic
notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable once Administrative
Agent receives such notice, and Borrower shall be bound to make a
borrowing in accordance therewith.

              C.   Disbursement of Funds.  Subject to subsection
2.1A(iv), all Term Loans and Revolving Loans under this Agreement
shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their
respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that neither
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for any
default by any other Lender in that other Lender's obligation to
make a Loan requested hereunder nor shall the Commitment of any
Lender to make the particular Type of Loan requested be increased or
decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that
other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder.
Promptly after receipt by Administrative Agent of a Notice of
Borrowing pursuant to subsection 2.1A or 2.1B (or telephonic
notice in lieu thereof), Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender for that Type of Loan of the proposed borrowing.  Each
such Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office not
later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the applicable
Funding Date.  Except to reimburse any Issuing Lender for the
amount of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, upon
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified in
subsections 4.1 (in the case of Loans made on the Effective Date)
and 4.2 (in the case of all Loans), Administrative Agent shall
make the proceeds of such Loans available to Borrower on the
applicable Funding Date by causing an amount of same day funds in
Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Loans received by
Administrative Agent from Lenders to be wire-transferred to an
account of Borrower as specified in the applicable Notice of
Borrowing.

              Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by
any Lender prior to a Funding Date for any Loans that such Lender
does not intend to make available to Administrative Agent the
amount of such Lender's Loan requested on such Funding Date,
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to Administrative Agent on such Funding Date and
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not
be obligated to, make available to Borrower a corresponding
amount on such Funding Date.  If such corresponding amount is not
in fact made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender,
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from such Funding Date until the
date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the
customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the correction of
errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the
Base Rate.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount
forthwith upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor,
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower, and Borrower
shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to Administrative
Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from such
Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative
Agent, at the rate payable under this Agreement for Base Rate
Loans.  Nothing in this subsection 2.1C shall be deemed to
relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments
hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrower may have
against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender
hereunder.

              D.   The Register.

              (i)  Administrative Agent shall maintain, at its address
     referred to in subsection 10.8, a register for the recordation of
     the names and addresses of Lenders and the Commitments and Loans of
     each Lender from time to time (the "Register").  The Register
     shall be available for inspection by Borrower at any reasonable
     time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

              (ii) Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the
     Tranche A Term Loan Commitment, Tranche B Term Loan Commitment
     and Revolving Loan Commitment and the Tranche A Term Loans,
     Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans from time to time of
     each Lender,  and each repayment or prepayment in respect of the
     principal amount of the Term Loan or Revolving Loans of each
     Lender.  Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on
     Borrower and each Lender, absent manifest error; provided that
     failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such
     recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or
     Borrower's Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans.

              (iii) Each Lender may record on its internal records
     (including the Notes held by such Lender) the amount of the
     Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and each Revolving
     Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof.  Any such
     recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower, absent
     manifest error; provided that failure to make any such
     recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect
     any Lender's Commitments or Borrower's Obligations in respect of
     any applicable Loans; and provided further that in the event of
     any inconsistency between the Register and any Lender's records,
     the recordations in the Register shall govern (absent manifest
     error).

              (iv) Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall
     deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the
     holders and owners of the corresponding Commitments and Loans
     listed therein for all purposes hereof, and no assignment or
     transfer of any such Commitment or Loan shall be effective, in
     each case unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting the
     assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by
     Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register as provided in
     subsection 10.1B(ii).  Prior to such recordation, all amounts
     owed with respect to the applicable Commitment or Loan shall be
     owed to the Lender listed in the Register as the owner thereof,
     and any request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the
     time of making such request or giving such authority or consent,
     is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and
     binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the
     corresponding Commitments or Loans.

              (v)  Borrower hereby designates CIBC to serve as Borrower's
     agent solely for purposes of maintaining the Register as provided in
     this subsection 2.1D, and Borrower hereby agrees that, to the
     extent CIBC serves in such capacity, CIBC and its officers,
     directors, employees, agents and Affiliates shall constitute
     Indemnitees for all purposes under subsection 10.3.

              E.   Optional Notes.  If so requested by any Lender by
written notice to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) at least
two Business Days prior to the Effective Date or at any time
thereafter, Borrower shall execute and deliver on the Effective
Date or within three Business Days after receipt of a written
request therefor, to each Lender (or to Administrative Agent for
that Lender if requested by such Lender) (a) a Tranche A Term
Loan Note substantially in the form of Exhibit V annexed hereto
to evidence that Lender's Tranche A Term Loan, in the principal
amount of that Lender's Tranche A Term Loan and with other
appropriate insertions, (b) a Tranche B Term Loan Note
substantially in the form of Exhibit VI annexed hereto to
evidence that Lender's Tranche B Term Loan, in the principal
amount of that Lender's Tranche B Term Loan and with other
appropriate insertions, and (c) a Revolving Note substantially in
the form of Exhibit VII annexed hereto to evidence that Lender's
Revolving Loans, in the principal amount of that Lender's
Revolving Loan Commitment and with other appropriate insertions;
provided that any Existing Lender requesting a Note must deliver
any Note or Notes issued in its favor under the Existing Credit
Agreement or deliver an affidavit satisfactory to Administrative
Agent stating that such Note or Notes have been lost and
providing for indemnification prior to delivery of a new Note
hereunder.

              Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until an Assignment Agreement effecting the assignment or
transfer thereof shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent
as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii).  Any request, authorization
or consent of any person or entity who, at the time of making
such request or giving such authority or consent, is the holder
of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent
holder, assignee or transferee of that Note or of any Note or
Notes issued in exchange therefor.

              If Borrower increases the aggregate principal amount of
the Term Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as the case may be,
pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iv), Borrower shall issue replacement
Term Notes or Revolving Notes, as the case may be, to each
Increasing Lender (or to Administrative Agent for such Increasing
Lender) that requests a Note in accordance with terms hereof and
new Term Notes or Revolving Notes, as the case may be, to each
New Lender (or to Administrative Agent for such New Lender) that
requests a Note in accordance with terms hereof.

       2.2    Interest on the Loans.

        A.    Rate of Interest.  Subject to the provisions of
subsections 2.6 and 2.7, each Term Loan and each Revolving Loan shall
bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date
made through maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a
rate determined by reference to the Base Rate or Adjusted LIBOR.
The applicable basis for determining the rate of interest with
respect to any Term Loan or any Revolving Loan shall be selected
by Borrower initially at the time a Notice of Borrowing is given
with respect to such Loan pursuant to subsection 2.1B, and the
basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any Term
Loan or any Revolving Loan may be changed from time to time
pursuant to subsection 2.2D. If on any day a Term Loan or
Revolving Loan is outstanding with respect to which notice has
not been delivered to Administrative Agent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement specifying the applicable basis for
determining the rate of interest, then for that day that Loan
shall bear interest determined by reference to the Base Rate.

              Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E and 2.7,
the Tranche A Term Loans, the Tranche B Term Loans and the
Revolving Loans shall bear interest through maturity as follows:

              (i)  if a Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Base
         Rate plus the Applicable Base Rate Margin for such Type of
         Loans; or

              (ii) if a LIBOR Loan, then at the sum of Adjusted LIBOR
         plus the Applicable LIBOR Margin for such Type of Loans.

              Upon delivery of a Margin Determination Certificate by
Borrower to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 6.1(xvi),
the Applicable Base Rate Margin and Applicable LIBOR Margin shall
automatically be adjusted in accordance with such Margin
Determination Certificate, such adjustment to become effective on
the 60th day after the end of the Fiscal Quarter to which the
financial results contained in the Margin Determination
Certificate relate; provided that (1) at any time a Margin
Determination Certificate is not delivered at the time required
pursuant to subsection 6.1(xvi) and in all events until the first
Margin Determination Certificate is required to be delivered
pursuant to subsection 6.1(xvi), from the time such Margin
Determination Certificate was required to be delivered until
delivery of such Margin Determination Certificate, the Applicable
Base Rate Margin shall be 2.00% for the Revolving Loans and the
Tranche A Term Loans and 3.00% for the Tranche B Term Loans, and
the Applicable LIBOR Margin shall be 3.00% for the Revolving
Loans and the Tranche A Term Loans and 4.00% for the Tranche B
Term Loans, and (2) if a Margin Determination Certificate
erroneously indicates an applicable margin more favorable to
Borrower than should be afforded by the actual calculation of the
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, Borrower shall promptly pay
additional interest and letter of credit fees to correct for such
error.

              B.   Interest Periods.  In connection with each LIBOR
Loan, Borrower may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an
interest period (each an "Interest Period") to be applicable to
such Loan, which Interest Period shall be, at Borrower's option,
either a one, two, three, six or, if provided by a Lender willing
to do so, twelve month period; provided that:

              (i)  the initial Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan shall
     commence on the Funding Date in respect of such Loan, in the case
     of a Loan initially made as a LIBOR Loan, or on the date
     specified in the applicable Notice of Conversion/Continuation, in
     the case of a Loan converted to a LIBOR Loan;

              (ii)  in the case of immediately successive Interest
     Periods applicable to a LIBOR Loan continued as such pursuant to
     a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, each successive Interest
     Period shall commence on the day on which the next preceding
     Interest Period expires;

              (iii) if an Interest Period would otherwise expire on
     a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire
     on the next succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any Interest
     Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day
     but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day
     occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the
     next preceding Business Day;

              (iv)  any Interest Period that begins on the last Business
     Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically
     corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such
     Interest Period) shall, subject to clause (v) of this subsection
     2.2B, end on the last Business Day of a calendar month;

              (v)   no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
     Tranche A Term Loans shall extend beyond March 4, 2007, no
     Interest Period with respect to any portion of the Tranche B Term
     Loans shall extend beyond March 4, 2008, and no Interest Period
     with respect to any portion of the Revolving Loans shall extend
     beyond the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date;

              (vi)  no Interest Period with respect to any Type of Term
     Loans shall extend beyond a date on which Borrower is required to make
     a scheduled payment of principal of such Type of Term Loans,
     unless the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Type
     of Term Loans that are Base Rate Loans plus (b) the aggregate
     principal amount of such Type of Term Loans that are LIBOR Loans
     with Interest Periods expiring on or before such date equals or
     exceeds the principal amount required to be paid on such Type of
     Term Loans on such date;

              (vii) no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
     Revolving Loans shall extend beyond the date on which a permanent
     reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments is scheduled to occur
     unless the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving
     Loans that are Base Rate Loans plus (b) the aggregate principal
     amount of Revolving Loans that are LIBOR Loans with Interest
     Periods expiring on or before such date plus (c) the excess of
     the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect over the aggregate
     principal amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding equals or
     exceeds the permanent reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments
     that is scheduled to occur on such date;

              (viii) there shall be no more than eight Interest Periods
     outstanding at any time; and

              (ix)   if Borrower fails to specify an Interest Period for any
     LIBOR Loan in the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
     Conversion/Continuation, Borrower shall be deemed to have
     selected an Interest Period of one month.

              C.    Interest Payments.  Subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.2E, interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to
each Interest Payment Date applicable to that Loan, upon any
prepayment of that Loan (to the extent accrued on the amount
being prepaid) and at maturity (including final maturity)
provided that if any Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans are
prepaid pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i), interest accrued on such
Loans through the date of such prepayment shall be payable on the
next succeeding Interest Payment Date applicable to Base Rate
Loans (or, if earlier, at final maturity).

              D.    Conversion or Continuation.

	      (i)  Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6, Borrower shall
     have the option (i) to convert at any time all or any part of its
     outstanding Term Loans or Revolving Loans from Loans bearing
     interest at a rate determined by reference to one basis to Loans
     bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to an
     alternative basis, in each case in the applicable Minimum Amount
     therefor, or (ii) upon the expiration of any Interest Period
     applicable to a LIBOR Loan, to continue all or any portion of
     such Loan equal to $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000
     in excess of that amount as a LIBOR Loan; provided, however, that
     a LIBOR Loan may only be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the
     expiration date of an Interest Period applicable thereto.

              (ii)  Borrower shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation
     to Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 AM (New York City
     time) at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed
     conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan)
     and at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed
     conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or
     a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan).  With respect to any LIBOR
     Loan, if Borrower fails to deliver a Notice of
     Conversion/Continuation as described above or if any proposed
     conversion/continuation under this subsection 2.2D is not
     permitted hereunder, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to
     convert such LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of
     the then-expiring Interest Period.

              (iii) A Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall specify
     (a) the proposed conversion/continuation date (which shall be a
     Business Day), (b) the amount and Type of the Loan to be
     converted/continued, (c) the nature of the proposed
     conversion/continuation, (d) in the case of a conversion to, or a
     continuation of, a LIBOR Loan, the requested Interest Period, and
     (e) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a LIBOR
     Loan, that no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing.  In lieu of delivering the above-
     described Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Borrower may give
     Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the required time of
     any proposed conversion/continuation under this subsection 2.2D,
     provided that Administrative Agent shall receive a Notice of
     Conversion/Continuation to confirm such telephonic notice no
     later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day on which
     such telephonic notice is given.  Upon receipt of written or
     telephonic notice of any proposed conversion/continuation under
     this subsection 2.2D, Administrative Agent shall promptly
     transmit such notice by telefacsimile or electronic mail (or by
     telephone promptly confirmed by telefacsimile or electronic mail)
     to each Lender.

              (iv)  Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall
     incur any liability to Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice
     referred to above that Administrative Agent believes in good
     faith to have been given by a duly authorized Officer or other
     person authorized to act on behalf of Borrower or for otherwise
     acting in good faith under this subsection 2.2D, and upon
     conversion or continuation of the applicable basis for
     determining the interest rate with respect to any Loans in
     accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such telephonic
     notice Borrower shall have effected a conversion or continuation,
     as the case may be, hereunder.

              (v)   Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B,
     2.6C and 2.6G, a notice of a proposed conversion to, or continuation
     of, a LIBOR Loan (whether by delivery of a Notice of
     Conversion/Continuation or telephonic notice) shall be
     irrevocable once Administrative Agent receives such notice, and
     Borrower shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in
     accordance therewith.

              E.    Default Rate.  Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default, the outstanding principal
amount of all Loans and, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, any interest payments thereon not paid when due and any fees
and other amounts then due and payable hereunder, shall
thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable
bankruptcy laws) payable upon demand at a rate that is 2.00% per
annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under this
Agreement with respect to the applicable Loans (or, in the case
of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate which is 2.00% per
annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under this
Agreement for Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans); provided
that, in the case of LIBOR Loans, upon the expiration of the
Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in
interest rate is effective such LIBOR Loans shall thereupon
become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable
upon demand at a rate which is 2.00% per annum in excess of the
interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base
Rate Loans.  Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of
interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a permitted
alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver
of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any
rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

              F.    Computation of Interest.  Interest on the Loans
and other Obligations shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate
Loans, on the basis of a 365-day year, and (ii) in the case of LIBOR
Loans and other Obligations (other than Base Rate Loans), on the
basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of
days elapsed in the period during which it accrues.  In computing
interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the
first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with
respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a LIBOR Loan,
the date of conversion of such LIBOR Loan to such Base Rate Loan,
as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of
such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable
to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted
to a LIBOR Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to
such LIBOR Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; provided
that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one
day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.

              G.    Maximum Rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this subsection 2.2, in no event shall the rate of interest
payable by Borrower with respect to any Loan exceed the maximum
rate of interest permitted to be charged under applicable law.

       2.3    Fees.

              A.    Revolving Loan Commitment Fees.  Borrower agrees
to pay to Administrative Agent, for distribution to each Lender in
proportion to that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan
Commitments, commitment fees for the period from and including
the Effective Date to and excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
Termination Date equal to the average of the daily excess of the
Revolving Loan Commitments over the sum of (i) the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus (ii) the
Letter of Credit Usage multiplied by one half of 1% per annum,
such commitment fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year and the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December of each Fiscal Year commencing on
the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, and on the
Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date.

              B.   Other Fees.  Borrower agrees to pay to Lead
Arranger and Administrative Agent such fees in the amounts and at
the times separately agreed upon among Borrower, Lead Arranger and
Administrative Agent.

     2.4    Repayments, Prepayments and Reductions in Revolving Loan
            Commitments; General Provisions Regarding Payments; Application
            of Proceeds of Collateral and Payments Under Subsidiary Guaranty.

            A.    Scheduled Payments of Term Loans.

            (i)   Scheduled Payments of Tranche A Term Loans.  Borrower shall
     make principal payments on the Tranche A Term Loans in
     installments on the last Business Day of each of the months and

; provided that the scheduled installments of principal of the

connection with any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of the

provided, further that the Tranche A Term Loans and all other

shall be paid in full no later than March 4, 2007 (the "Tranche A

Borrower in respect of the Tranche A Term Loans on such date
shall be in an amount, if such amount is different from that
specified above, sufficient to repay all amounts owing by
Borrower under this Agreement with respect to the Tranche A Term
Loans; and provided, further that if the aggregate principal
amount of the Tranche A Term Loans is increased pursuant to

be made after such increase becomes effective shall be increased
by an amount equal to (a) the aggregate principal amount of the
increase in the Tranche A Term Loans pursuant to subsection
2.1A(iv) multiplied by (b) an amount equal to (x) such scheduled
repayment amount divided by (y) the aggregate principal amount of
the Tranche A Term Loans to be repaid immediately prior to giving

to subsection 2.1A(iv).

              (ii)  Scheduled Payments of Tranche B Term Loans.
     Borrower shall make principal payments on the Tranche B Term Loans

     (a) the aggregate principal amount of the increase in the Tranche
     B Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iv) multiplied by (b) an
     amount equal to (x) such scheduled repayment amount divided by
     (y) the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans to

     the Tranche B Term Loans made pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iv).

              B.    Prepayments and Unscheduled Reductions in Revolving
Loan Commitments.

              (i)   Voluntary Prepayments. Borrower may, upon not less
     than one Business Day's irrevocable prior written notice, in the case
     of Base Rate Loans, and three Business Days' irrevocable prior
     written notice, in the case of LIBOR Loans, in each case given to
     Administrative Agent by 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
     date required (which written notice Administrative Agent will
     promptly transmit by telefacsimile or electronic mail to each
     Lender), and any Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or
     Revolving Loans on any Business Day in whole or in part in an
     aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of
     $100,000 in excess of that amount; provided, however, that any
     LIBOR Loan may be prepaid on a day other than the expiration of
     the Interest Period applicable thereto, only if Borrower pays the
     amounts due pursuant to subsection 2.6D caused by such
     prepayment.  Notice of prepayment having been given as aforesaid,
     the principal amount of the Loans specified in such notice shall
     become due and payable on the prepayment date specified therein.
     Any such voluntary prepayment shall be applied as specified in
     subsection 2.4B(iv).

              (ii)   Voluntary Reductions of Revolving Loan Commitments.
     Borrower may, upon not less than five Business Days' irrevocable
     prior written notice to Administrative Agent (which written
     notice Administrative Agent will promptly transmit by
     telefacsimile or electronic mail to each Lender), at any time and
     from time to time terminate in whole or permanently reduce in
     part, without premium or penalty, the Revolving Loan Commitments
     in an amount up to the amount by which the Revolving Loan
     Commitments exceed the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan
     Commitments at the time of such proposed termination or
     reduction; provided that any such partial reduction of the
     Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum
     amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess
     of that amount.  Borrower's notice to Administrative Agent shall
     designate the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such
     termination or reduction and the amount of any partial reduction,
     and such termination or reduction of the Revolving Loan
     Commitments shall be effective on the date specified in
     Borrower's notice and shall reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment
     of each Revolving Lender proportionately to its Pro Rata Share.

              (iii)  Mandatory Prepayments and Mandatory Reductions of
     Revolving Loan Commitments.  The Loans shall be prepaid and/or
     the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced in
     the amounts and under the circumstances set forth below, all such
     prepayments and/or reductions to be applied as set forth below or
     as more specifically provided in subsection 2.4B(iv):

                    (a)  Prepayments and Reductions From Net Asset Sale
              Proceeds.  No later than the date of receipt by Borrower or
              any of its Subsidiaries of any Net Asset Sale Proceeds in
              respect of any Asset Sale, Borrower shall either (1) prepay
              the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
              permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to such Net
              Asset Sale Proceeds or (2) so long as no Potential Event of
              Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
              continuing and to the extent that aggregate Net Asset Sale
              Proceeds for such Fiscal Year exceed $1,000,000, deliver to
              Administrative Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth
              (x) that portion of such Net Asset Sale Proceeds that Borrower
              or such Subsidiary intends to reinvest in equipment or other
              productive assets of the general type used in the business of
              Borrower and its Subsidiaries within 180 days of such date of
              receipt and (y) the proposed use of such portion of the Net
              Asset Sale Proceeds and such other information with respect
              to such reinvestment as Administrative Agent may reasonably
              request, and Borrower shall, or shall cause one or more of
              its Subsidiaries to, promptly and diligently apply such
              portion to such reinvestment purposes.  Pending any such
              reinvestment, such Net Asset Sale Proceeds shall be held in
              the Collateral Account pledged to Administrative Agent for
              the ratable benefit of Lenders.  In addition, Borrower shall,
              no later than 180 days after receipt of such Net Asset Sale
              Proceeds that have not theretofore been applied to the
              Obligations or that have not been so reinvested as provided
              above, make an additional prepayment of the Loans (and/or
              the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced)
              in the full amount of all such Net Asset Sale Proceeds.

                    (b)  Prepayments and Reductions from Net Insurance/
              Condemnation Proceeds.  No later than the first Business Day
              following the date Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is
              required to prepay the Loans in accordance with the provisions
              of subsection 6.4C with Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds,
              Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan
              Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an aggregate amount
              equal to the amount of such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds.

                    (c)  Prepayments and Reductions Due to Reversion of
              Surplus Assets of Pension Plans.  On the date of return to
              Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any surplus assets of
              any Pension Plan of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
              Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or the Revolving Loan
              Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an aggregate amount
              (such amount being the "Net Pension Proceeds") equal to 100% of
              such returned surplus assets, net of transaction costs and
              expenses incurred in obtaining such return, including incremental
              taxes payable as a result thereof.

                    (d)  Prepayments and Reductions Due to Issuance of Equity
              Securities.  On the date of receipt of the Net Securities
              Proceeds from the issuance of any Capital Stock of Borrower or of
              any Subsidiary of Borrower or from any capital contribution to
              Borrower by any holder of Capital Stock thereof after the
              Effective Date (other than, provided that no Potential Event of
              Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
              at such time, proceeds from the issuance of Capital Stock or from
              capital contributions to pay for acquisitions permitted pursuant
              to subsection 7.7), Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or the
              Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced in an
              aggregate amount equal to 25% of such Net Securities Proceeds.

                    (e)  Intentionally Deleted.

                    (f)  Prepayments and Reductions from Consolidated Excess
              Cash Flow.  If there is Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for any
              Fiscal Year (commencing with Fiscal Year 2002), Borrower shall,
              no later than 90 days after the end of such Fiscal Year, prepay
              the Loans (but the Revolving Loan Commitment shall not be
              permanently reduced) in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of such
              Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, provided, however if the
              Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as of the most recent fiscal
              quarter then ended is less than 2.50:1.00, Borrower shall not be
              required to make such prepayment.

                    (g)  Calculations of Net Proceeds Amounts; Additional
              Prepayments and Reductions Based on Subsequent Calculations.
              Concurrently with any prepayment of the Loans and/or reduction
              of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to subsections
              2.4B(iii)(b) - 2.4B(iii)(f), Borrower shall deliver to
              Administrative Agent and Lenders an Officer's Certificate
              demonstrating the calculation of the amount (the "Net Proceeds
              Amount") of the applicable Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Net
              Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Net Pension Proceeds, Net
              Securities Proceeds, or Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, as the
              case may be, that gave rise to such prepayment and/or reduction.
              If Borrower subsequently determines that the actual Net Proceeds
              Amount was greater than the amount set forth in such Officer's
              Certificate (including if any actual taxes to be paid as a result
              of an Asset Sale is less than the estimated taxes to be paid as a
              result of such Asset Sale), Borrower shall promptly make an
              additional prepayment of the Loans (and/or, if applicable, the
              Revolving Loan Commitments shall be permanently reduced) in an
              amount equal to the amount of such excess, and Borrower shall
              concurrently therewith deliver to Administrative Agent an
              Officer's Certificate demonstrating the derivation of the
              additional Net Proceeds Amount resulting in such excess.

                    (h)  Prepayments Due to Reductions or Restrictions of
              Revolving Loan Commitments.  Borrower shall from time to time
              prepay first the Revolving Loans to the extent necessary so that
              the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments shall not at
              any time exceed the lesser of the Revolving Loan Commitments or
              the Borrowing Base then in effect and second to cash
              collateralize any outstanding Letters of Credit.

              (iv)  Application of Prepayments.

                    (a)  Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type of
              Loans and Order of Maturity.  Subject to the provisions of
              subsection 2.4D, any voluntary prepayments pursuant to subsection
              2.4B(i) shall be applied to the Term Loans or the Revolving Loans
              as specified by Borrower in the applicable notice of prepayment;
              provided that if Borrower fails to specify the Loans to which any
              such prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be
              applied first to repay outstanding Term Loans to the full extent
              thereof, second to repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full
              extent thereof and permanently reduce the Revolving Loan
              Commitments and third to cash collateralize any outstanding
              Letters of Credit and permanently reduce the Revolving Loan
              Commitments to the full extent thereof.  Any voluntary
              prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall
              be applied to prepay the Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B
              Term Loans on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the respective
              outstanding principal amounts thereof) to reduce the scheduled
              installments of principal of the Tranche A Term Loans and Tranche
              B Term Loans set forth in subsections 2.4A(i) and 2.4A(ii) on a
              pro rata basis (in accordance with the respective outstanding
              principal amounts thereof).

                    (b)  Application of Mandatory Prepayments by Type of Loans.
              Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any
              amount (the "Applied Amount") required to be applied as a
              mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans and/or a reduction of the
              Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to subsections 2.4B(iii)(a) -
              2.4B(iii)(g) shall be applied first to prepay the Term Loans to
              the full extent thereof, second, to the extent of any remaining
              portion of the Applied Amount, to prepay the Revolving Loans to
              the full extent thereof and to cash collateralize any outstanding
              Letters of Credit and to further permanently reduce the Revolving
              Loan Commitments by the amount of such prepayment, third, to the
              extent of any remaining portion of such Applied Amount, to
              further permanently reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments to the
              full extent thereof (except as provided in subsection
              2.4B(iii)(f)).  If an Event of Default has occurred and is
              continuing, any amount required to be applied as a mandatory
              prepayment shall be applied as set forth in subsection 2.4D.

                    (c)  Application of Mandatory Prepayments of Term Loans to
              Tranche A Term Loans and Tranche B Term Loans and the Scheduled
              Installments of Principal Thereof.  Any amount required to be
              applied as a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to
              subsection 2.4B(iii) shall be applied to the Tranche A Term Loans
              or the Tranche B Term Loans in such manner as Borrower may
              designate in its Officer's Certificate delivered in connection
              therewith and shall be applied to scheduled installments of
              principal of the Tranche A Term Loans or the Tranche B Term
              Loans, as the case may be, (i) in forward order of maturity for
              the succeeding four quarterly payments and (ii) thereafter, in
              inverse chronological order of maturity.

                    (d)  Application of Prepayments to Base Rate Loans and
              LIBOR Loans.  Considering Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term
              Loans and Revolving Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment
              thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full
              extent thereof before application to LIBOR Loans, in each case in
              a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to
              be made by Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.6D.

              C.    General Provisions Regarding Payments.

              (i)   Manner and Time of Payment.  All payments by Borrower of
     principal, interest, fees and other Obligations hereunder and
     under the Notes shall be made in Dollars in same day funds,
     without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any restriction
     or condition, and delivered to Administrative Agent not later
     than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date due at the
     Administrative Agent's Office for the account of Lenders; funds
     received by Administrative Agent after that time on such due date
     shall be deemed to have been paid by Borrower on the next
     succeeding Business Day.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments
     of amounts deposited in the Collateral Account pursuant to the
     proviso to subsection 2.4B(iii)(a) shall be deemed to have been
     paid by Borrower on the applicable date or dates such amounts are
     applied to prepay LIBOR Loans.  Borrower hereby authorizes
     Administrative Agent to charge its accounts with Administrative
     Agent in order to cause timely payment to be made to
     Administrative Agent of all principal, interest, fees and
     expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being
     available in its accounts for that purpose).

              (ii)  Application of Payments.  Prior to any payments being
     applied to principal or interest under this Agreement or under
     the Notes, such payments shall first be applied to any
     outstanding and payable fees, costs, expenses, indemnities or
     other amounts (aside from principal or interest due under the
     Loan Documents), as determined in the reasonable opinion of
     Administrative Agent.

              (iii) Application of Payments to Principal and Interest.
     Except as provided in subsection 2.2C, all payments in respect of
     the principal amount of any Loan shall include payment of accrued
     interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all
     such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any
     Loan on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to
     such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest before
     application to principal.

              (iv) Apportionment of Payments.  Aggregate principal and
     interest payments in respect of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall
     be apportioned among all outstanding Loans to which such payments
     relate, in each case proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro
     Rata Shares.  Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to
     each Lender, at its primary address set forth below its name on
     the appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address as
     such Lender may request, its Pro Rata Share of all such payments
     received by Administrative Agent and the commitment fees of such
     Lender, if any, when received by Administrative Agent pursuant to
     subsection 2.3.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
     subsection 2.4C(iv), if, pursuant to the provisions of subsection
     2.6C, any Notice of Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to
     any Affected Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate
     Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share of any LIBOR Loans,
     Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning
     payments received thereafter.

              (v)  Payments on Business Days.  Whenever any payment to
     be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a
     Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
     Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the
     computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the
     commitment fees hereunder, as the case may be.

              (vi) Notation of Payment.  Each Lender agrees that before
     disposing of any Note held by it, or any part thereof (other than
     by granting participations therein), that Lender will use
     reasonable efforts to make a notation thereon of all Loans
     evidenced by that Note and all principal payments previously made
     thereon and of the date to which interest thereon has been paid;
     provided that the failure to make (or any error in the making of)
     a notation of any Loan made under such Note shall not limit or
     otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower hereunder or under
     such Note with respect to any Loan or any payments of principal
     or interest on such Note; provided, further, that in the event of
     any inconsistency, the Register shall govern (absent manifest
     error).

              D.    Application of Proceeds of Collateral and Payments
after Event of Default.

              Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, (a) all payments received on account of the
Obligations, whether from Borrower, from any Subsidiary Guarantor
or otherwise, shall be applied by Administrative Agent against
the Obligations and (b) all proceeds received by Administrative
Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon all or any part of the Collateral under any
Collateral Document may, in the discretion of Administrative
Agent, be held by Administrative Agent as Collateral for, and/or
(then or at any time thereafter) applied in full or in part by
Administrative Agent against, the applicable Secured Obligations
(as defined in such Collateral Document), in each case in the
following order of priority:

              (i)   To the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale,
     collection or other realization, including reasonable
     compensation to Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel,
     and all other expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred
     by Administrative Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts
     for which Administrative Agent is entitled to compensation
     (including the fees described in subsection 2.3), reimbursement
     and indemnification under any Loan Document and all advances made
     by Administrative Agent thereunder for the account of the
     applicable Loan Party, and to the payment of all costs and
     expenses paid or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
     with the Loan Documents, all in accordance with subsections 9.4,
     10.2 and 10.3 and the other terms of this Agreement and the other
     Loan Documents;

              (ii)  thereafter to the payment of all other Secured Obligations
     (as defined in such Collateral Document) or Guarantied
     Obligations (as defined in the Subsidiary Guaranty) for the
     ratable benefit of the holders thereof (subject to the provisions
     of subsection 2.4C(ii)); and

              (iii) thereafter to the payment to or upon the order of such
     Loan Party or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive
     the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

     2.5      Use of Proceeds.

              A.    Term Loans.  The proceeds of the Term Loans made on the
Effective Date shall initially be applied by Borrower to
(a) consummate the Acquisition and (b) pay transaction costs in
an amount not to exceed $7,500,000, and thereafter for the
purposes set forth in subsection 2.5B.

              B.    Increases of Term Loans; Revolving Loans.  The proceeds of
any Term Loans made after the Effective Date pursuant to
subsection 2.1A(iv) and the proceeds of the Revolving Loans shall
be applied by Borrower for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, which may include the making of intercompany
loans to any of Borrower's wholly-owned domestic Subsidiaries, in
accordance with subsection 7.1(iv), for their own general
corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, refinancings,
acquisitions and investments made in accordance with the terms
hereof.

              C.    Margin Regulations.  No portion of the proceeds of any
borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries in any manner that might cause the borrowing
or the application of such proceeds to violate Regulation T,
Regulation U or Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board or
to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the
date or dates of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

     2.6      Special Provisions Governing LIBOR Loans.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the following provisions shall govern with
respect to LIBOR Loans as to the matters covered:

              A.    Determination of Applicable Interest Rate.  As soon
as practicable after 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on each
Interest Rate Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall
determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate
that shall apply to the LIBOR Loans for which an interest rate is
then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and
shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone
confirmed in writing) to Borrower and each Lender.

              B.    Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate.
If Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination
shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to
any LIBOR Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the
interbank Eurodollar market adequate and fair means do not exist
for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on
the basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted LIBOR,
Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower
and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may
be made as, or converted to, LIBOR Loans until such time as
Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist and
(ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation
given by Borrower with respect to the Loans in respect of which
such determination was made shall be deemed to be for a Base Rate
Loan.

              C.    Illegality or Impracticability of LIBOR Loans.
If on any date any Lender shall have determined (which determination
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but
shall be made only after consultation with Borrower and
Administrative Agent) that the making, maintaining or
continuation of its LIBOR Loans (i) has become unlawful as a
result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law,
treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or
would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule,
regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even
though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) or
(ii) has become impracticable, or would cause such Lender
material hardship, as a result of contingencies occurring after
the date of this Agreement which materially and adversely affect
the interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in
that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an
"Affected Lender" and it shall on that day give notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower
and Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender
by telefacsimile or electronic mail).  Thereafter (a) the
obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to convert
Loans to, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall
be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such
determination by the Affected Lender relates to a LIBOR Loan then
being requested by Borrower pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or
a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall
make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a
Base Rate Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain
its outstanding LIBOR Loans (the "Affected Loans") shall be
terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the
Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans
or when required by law, and (d) the Affected Loans shall
automatically convert into Base Rate Loans on the date of such
termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a
determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates to
a LIBOR Loan then being requested by Borrower pursuant to a
Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation,
Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.6D, to rescind such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation as to all Lenders by giving notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the
Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as described
above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to each other Lender).  Except as provided in
the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection
2.6C shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an
Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans
to, LIBOR Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

              D.    Compensation For Breakage or Non-Commencement
of Interest Periods.  Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon
written request by that Lender (which request shall set forth the
basis for requesting such amounts), for all reasonable losses,
expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid by that Lender
to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its LIBOR Loans
and any loss, expense or liability sustained by that Lender in
connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds)
which that Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than
a default by that Lender) a borrowing of any LIBOR Loan does not
occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a
telephonic request therefor, or a conversion to or continuation
of any LIBOR Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in
a Notice of Conversion/Continuation or a telephonic request for
conversion or continuation, (ii) if any prepayment or other
principal payment or any conversion of any of its LIBOR Loans
(including any prepayment or conversion occasioned by the
circumstances described in subsection 2.6C) occurs on a date
prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that
Loan, (iii) if any prepayment of any of its LIBOR Loans is not
made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by
Borrower, or (iv) as a consequence of any other default by
Borrower in the repayment of its LIBOR Loans when required by the
terms of this Agreement.

              E.    Booking of LIBOR Loans.  Any Lender may make,
carry or transfer LIBOR Loans at, to, or for the account of any of
its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of that Lender.

              F.    Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans.
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this subsection
2.6 and under subsection 2.7A shall be made as though that Lender had
actually funded each of its relevant LIBOR Loans through the
purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate
obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted
LIBOR in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Loan and
having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period,
whether or not its LIBOR Loans had actually been funded in such
manner, and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from
an offshore office of that Lender to a domestic office of that
Lender in the United States of America; provided, however, that
each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it
sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for
the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this subsection
2.6 and under subsection 2.7A.

              G.    LIBOR Loans After Default.  After the occurrence
of and during the continuation of a Potential Event of Default or an
Event of Default, (i) Borrower may not elect to have a Loan be
made or maintained as, or converted to, a LIBOR Loan after the
expiration of any Interest Period then in effect for that Loan
and (ii) subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, any Notice
of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by
Borrower with respect to a requested borrowing or
conversion/continuation that has not yet occurred shall be deemed
to be rescinded by Borrower.

     2.7      Increased Costs; Taxes; Capital Adequacy.

     A.       Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes.  Subject
to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with
respect to the matters covered thereby), if any Lender (including
any Issuing Lender) shall determine (which determination shall,
absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon
all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order, or any change therein or in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof (including
the introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order), or any determination of a court or
Governmental Authority, in each case that becomes effective after
the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any guideline,
request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other governmental or quasi-Governmental
Authority (whether or not having the force of law):

              (i)  subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending
     office) to any additional Tax with respect to this Agreement or
     any of its obligations hereunder (including with respect to issuing
     or maintaining any Letters of Credit or purchasing or maintaining
     any participations therein or maintaining any Commitment
     hereunder) or any payments to such Lender (or its applicable
     lending office) of principal, interest, fees or any other amount
     payable hereunder;

              (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve
     (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
     reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or
     similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
     liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or
     other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
     any office of such Lender (other than any such reserve or other
     requirements with respect to LIBOR Loans that are reflected in
     the definition of Adjusted LIBOR); or

              (iii)imposes any other condition (other than with respect
     to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable
     lending office) or its obligations hereunder or the interbank
     Eurodollar market;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
such Lender of agreeing to make, making or maintaining its Loans
or Commitments or agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any
Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase, purchasing or
maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount
received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending
office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, Borrower
shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of the statement
referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or
amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different
method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in
its sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to
compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction
in amounts received or receivable hereunder.  Such Lender shall
deliver to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a
written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender under
this subsection 2.7A, which statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

     B.       Withholding of Taxes.

              (i)  Payments to Be Free and Clear.  Unless otherwise required
     by applicable law, all sums payable by Borrower under this Agreement
     and the other Loan Documents shall be paid free and clear of, and
     without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax
     imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the
     United States of America or any political subdivision in or of
     the United States of America or any other jurisdiction from or to
     which a payment is made by or on behalf of Borrower or by any
     federation or organization of which the United States of America
     or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment.

              (ii) Grossing-up of Payments.  If Borrower or any other Person
     is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account
     of any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by Borrower to
     Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of the Loan
     Documents:

                  (a)  Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent of any
               such requirement or any change in any such requirement as
               soon as Borrower becomes aware of it;

                  (b)  Borrower shall pay any such Tax when such Tax is
               due, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is
               imposed on Borrower) for its own account or (if that
               liability is imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender,
               as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of
               Administrative Agent or such Lender;

                  (c)  the sum payable by Borrower in respect of which
               the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required
               shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that,
               after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment,
               Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
               receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would
               have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment
               been required or made (including taxes on additional payments
               made on account of this subsection 2.7B net of any tax
               benefits received with respect to any Taxes); and

                  (d)  within 30 days after paying any sum from which it is
               required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within
               30 days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is
               required by clause (b) above to pay, Borrower shall deliver to
               Administrative Agent and/or other affected parties evidence
               satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction,
               withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the
               relevant taxing or other authority;

     provided that no such additional amount shall be required to
     be paid to any Lender under clause (c) above (i) to the
     extent such additional amount relates to a portion of any
     sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan
     Documents with respect to which such Lender does not act for
     its own account, or (ii) except to the extent that any
     change after the date on which such Lender became a Lender
     in any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or
     payment as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase
     in the rate of such deduction, withholding or payment from
     that in effect on the date on which such Lender became a
     Lender, in respect of payments to such Lender.

              (iii) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax.

                    (a)  Each Lender that is organized under the laws of any
              jurisdiction other than the United States or any state or other
              political subdivision thereof (for purposes of this subsection
              2.7B(iii), a "Non-US Lender") shall deliver to Administrative
              Agent and to Borrower, on or prior to the Effective Date (in the
              case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on
              or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to
              which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and
              at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of
              Borrower or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise
              of its discretion), two original copies of Internal Revenue
              Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor forms) properly
              completed and duly executed by such Non-US Lender, or, in the
              case of a Non-US Lender claiming exemption from United States
              federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the
              Internal Revenue Code with respect to payments of "portfolio
              interest", a form W-8BEN, and, in the case of a Non-US Lender
              that has certified in writing to Administrative Agent that it is
              not a "bank" (as defined in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal
              Revenue Code), a certificate (the "Certificate re: Non-Bank
              Status") of such Non-US Lender certifying that such Non-US Lender
              is not (i) a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the
              Internal Revenue Code, (ii) a ten-percent shareholder (within the
              meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code) of
              Borrower, or (iii) a controlled foreign corporation related to
              Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Internal
              Revenue Code) in each case together with any other certificate or
              statement of exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code
              or the regulations issued thereunder to establish that such Non-
              US Lender is not subject to United States withholding tax with
              respect to any payments to such Non-US Lender of interest payable
              under any of the Loan Documents.

                    (b)  Each Non-US Lender, to the extent it does not act or
              ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of
              any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan
              Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation by
	      such Lender), shall deliver to Administrative Agent and to
              Borrower, on or prior to the Effective Date (in the case of each
              Lender listed on the signature pages hereof), on or prior to the
              date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a
              Lender (in the case of each other Lender), or on such later date
              when such Non-US Lender ceases to act for its own account with
              respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at
              such other times as may be necessary in the determination of
              Borrower or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise
              of its discretion), (1) two original copies of the forms or
              statements required to be provided by such Non-US Lender under
              subsection 2.7B(iii)(a), properly completed and duly executed by
              such Non-US Lender, to establish the portion of any such sums
              paid or payable with respect to which such Non-US Lender acts for
              its own account that is not subject to United States withholding
              tax, and (2) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
              W-8IMY (or any successor forms) properly completed and duly
              executed by such Non-US Lender, together with any information, if
              any, such Non-US Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and
              any other certificate or statement of exemption required under
              the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations issued thereunder,
              to establish that such Non-US Lender is not acting for its own
              account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to
              such Non-US Lender.

                    (c)  Each Non-US Lender hereby agrees, from time to time
              after the initial delivery by such Non-US Lender of such forms,
              whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such
              forms, certificates or other evidence so delivered obsolete or
              inaccurate in any material respect or if, by virtue of a change
              in law or regulations, such forms are no longer valid evidence of
              a person's exemption from withholding tax which is reasonably
              satisfactory to Borrower, that such Non-US Lender shall promptly
              (1) deliver to Administrative Agent and to Borrower two original
              copies of renewals, amendments or additional or successor forms,
              properly completed and duly executed by such Non-US Lender,
              together with any other certificate or statement of exemption
              required in order to confirm or establish that such Non-US Lender
              is not subject to United States withholding tax with respect to
              payments to such Non-US Lender under the Loan Documents and, as
              the case may be, that such Non-US Lender does not act for its own
              account with respect to any portion of any such payments, or
              (2) notify Administrative Agent and Borrower of its inability to
              deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence.

                    (d)  Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional
              amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of subsection
              2.7B(ii), (1) with respect to any Tax required to be deducted or
              withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or
              statements of exemption such Lender chooses to transmit with an
              Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY pursuant to subsection
              2.7B(iii)(b)(2) or (2) if such Non-US Lender shall have failed to
              satisfy the requirements of clause (a), (b) or (c)(1) of this
              subsection 2.7B(iii); provided that if such Non-US Lender shall
              have satisfied the requirements of subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) on
              the date such Non-US Lender became a Lender, nothing in this
              subsection 2.7B(iii)(d) shall relieve Borrower of its obligation
              to pay any amounts pursuant to subsection 2.7B(ii)(c) if, as a
              result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or
              governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the
              interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Non-
              US Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms,
              certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing
              the fact that such Non-US Lender is not subject to withholding as
              described in subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).

     C.    Capital Adequacy Adjustment.  If any Lender shall have
determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or
applicability after the date hereof of any law, rule or
regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding capital adequacy,
or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof,
or compliance by any Lender (or its applicable lending office)
with any guideline, request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
as a consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender's Loans or
Commitments or Letters of Credit or participations therein or
other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the
Letters of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such
controlling corporation could have achieved but for such
adoption, effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or
compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender
or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy),
then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt
by Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in the
next sentence, Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for such reduction.
Such Lender shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to
Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional
amounts, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all
parties hereto absent manifest error.

     2.8    Obligation of Lenders and Issuing Lenders to Mitigate.

            Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, as promptly
as practicable after the officer of such Lender or Issuing Lender
responsible for administering the Loans or Letters of Credit of
such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, becomes aware
of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition
that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that
would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments
under subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6, it will, to the extent
not inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender or
Issuing Lender and/or any applicable legal or regulatory
restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to make, issue, fund or
maintain the Commitments of such Lender or the affected Loans or
Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender through
another lending or letter of credit office of such Lender or
Issuing Lender, or (ii) take such other measures as such Lender
or Issuing Lender may deem reasonable, if as a result thereof the
circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an Affected
Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would
otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender or Issuing Lender
pursuant to subsection  2.7 or subsection 3.6 would be materially
reduced and if, as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in
its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining
of such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit through such
other lending or letter of credit office or in accordance with
such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise
materially adversely affect such Commitments or Loans or Letters
of Credit or the interests of such Lender or Issuing Lender;
provided that such Lender or Issuing Lender will not be obligated
to utilize such other lending or letter of credit office pursuant
to this subsection 2.8 unless Borrower agrees to pay all
incremental expenses incurred by such Lender or Issuing Lender as
a result of utilizing such other lending or letter of credit
office as described in clause (i) above.  A certificate as to the
amount of any such expenses payable by Borrower pursuant to this
subsection 2.8 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender or Issuing
Lender to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

Section 3.    LETTERS OF CREDIT

       3.1    Issuance of Letters of Credit and Lenders' Purchase of
              Participations Therein.

              A.    Letters of Credit.  In addition to Borrower requesting
that Lenders make Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iii),
Borrower may request, in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection 3.1, from time to time during the period from the
Effective Date to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
Termination Date, that one or more Lenders issue Letters of
Credit for the account of Borrower for the purposes specified in
the definition of Letters of Credit.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the
representations and warranties of Borrower herein set forth, any
one or more Lenders may, but (except as provided in subsection
3.1B(iii)) shall not be obligated to, issue such Letters of
Credit in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1;
provided that Borrower shall not request that any Lender issue
(and no Lender shall issue):

              (i)   any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
     issuance, the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments
     would exceed the lesser of the Revolving Loan Commitments or the
     Borrowing Base then in effect;

              (ii)  any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
     issuance, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $30,000,000;

              (iii) any Letter of Credit having an expiration date later
     than the earlier of (a) ten days prior to the Revolving Loan
     Commitment Termination Date and (b) the date which is one year
     from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit; provided that
     the immediately preceding clause (b) shall not prevent any
     Issuing Lender (but subject to clause (a) above) from agreeing
     that a Letter of Credit will automatically be extended for one or
     more successive periods not to exceed one year each unless such
     Issuing Lender elects not to extend for any such additional
     period; and provided, further that such Issuing Lender shall
     elect not to extend such Letter of Credit if it has knowledge
     that an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing (and has not been waived in accordance
     with subsection 10.6) at the time such Issuing Lender must elect
     whether or not to allow such extension;

              (iv)  any Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other
     than Dollars;

              (v)   any Letter of Credit with a face amount of less than
     $10,000, or any Letter of Credit with a face amount of less than
     $100,000 if after giving effect to such issuance there shall be
     more than 15 Letters of Credit outstanding with face amounts of
     less than $100,000; or

              (vi)  any Letter of Credit that is otherwise unacceptable to
     the applicable Issuing Lender in its reasonable discretion.

              B.    Mechanics of Issuance.

             (i)    Notice of Issuance.  Whenever Borrower desires the
     issuance of a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to Administrative Agent
     a Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit substantially in the form
     of Exhibit III annexed hereto no later than 12:00 Noon (New York
     City time) at least three Business Days, or in each case such
     shorter period as may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender in any
     particular instance, in advance of the proposed date of issuance.
     The Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit shall specify (a) the
     proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (b)
     the face amount of the Letter of Credit, (c) the expiration date
     of the Letter of Credit, (d) the name and address of the
     beneficiary, and (e) either the verbatim text of the proposed
     Letter of Credit or the proposed terms and conditions thereof,
     including a precise description of any documents to be presented
     by the beneficiary which, if presented by the beneficiary prior
     to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, would require the
     Issuing Lender to make payment under the Letter of Credit;
     provided that the Issuing Lender, in its reasonable discretion,
     may require changes in the text of the proposed Letter of Credit
     or any such documents; and provided, further that no Letter of
     Credit shall require payment against a conforming draft to be
     made thereunder on the same Business Day (under the laws of the
     jurisdiction in which the office of the Issuing Lender to which
     such draft is required to be presented is located) that such
     draft is presented if such presentation is made after 12:00 Noon
     (in the time zone of such office of the Issuing Lender) on such
     Business Day.

              (ii)  Update of Certifications.  Borrower shall notify the
     applicable Issuing Lender (and Administrative Agent, if
     Administrative Agent is not such Issuing Lender) prior to the
     issuance of any Letter of Credit if any of the matters to which
     Borrower is required to certify in the applicable Notice of
     Issuance of Letter of Credit is no longer true and correct as of
     the proposed date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, and upon
     the issuance of any Letter of Credit Borrower shall be deemed to
     have re-certified, as of the date of such issuance, as to the
     matters to which Borrower is required to certify in the
     applicable Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit.

              (iii) Determination of Issuing Lender.  Upon receipt by
     Administrative Agent of a Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit
     pursuant to subsection 3.1B(i) requesting the issuance of a
     Letter of Credit, if Administrative Agent elects to issue such
     Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify
     Borrower, and Administrative Agent shall be the Issuing Lender
     with respect thereto.  If Administrative Agent, in its sole
     discretion, elects not to issue such Letter of Credit,
     Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify Borrower, whereupon
     Borrower may request any other Lender to issue such Letter of
     Credit by delivering to such Lender a copy of the applicable
     Notice of Issuance of Letter of Credit.  Any Lender so requested
     to issue such Letter of Credit shall promptly notify Borrower and
     Administrative Agent whether or not, in its sole discretion, it
     has elected to issue such Letter of Credit, and any such Lender
     that so elects to issue such Letter of Credit shall be the
     Issuing Lender with respect thereto.

              (iv)  Issuance of Letter of Credit.  Upon satisfaction or
     waiver (in accordance with subsection 10.6) of the conditions set forth
     in subsection 4.3, the Issuing Lender shall issue the requested
     Letter of Credit in accordance with the Issuing Lender's standard
     operating procedures.

              (v)   Notification to Lenders.  Upon the issuance of or
     amendment to any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender shall
     promptly notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of
     such issuance or amendment by telefacsimile or electronic mail
     (or by telephone promptly confirmed by telefacsimile or
     electronic mail).  Promptly after receipt of such notice (or, if
     Administrative Agent is the Issuing Lender, together with such
     notice), Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender by
     telefacsimile or electronic mail (or by telephone promptly
     confirmed by telefacsimile or electronic mail) of the amount of
     such Lender's respective participation in such Letter of Credit,
     determined in accordance with subsection 3.1C.

     C.    Lenders' Purchase of Participations in Letters of Credit.
Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed to, and
hereby agrees to, have irrevocably purchased from the Issuing
Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and any drawings
honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the maximum amount which is or at any time may
become available to be drawn thereunder.

       3.2  Letter of Credit Fees.

            Borrower agrees to pay the following amounts with
respect to Letters of Credit issued hereunder:

            (i)   with respect to each Letter of Credit, (a) a fronting fee,
      payable to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable
      Issuing Lender, equal to 0.125% per annum of the daily amount
      available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, and (b) a
      letter of credit fee, payable to Administrative Agent for the
      account of those Lenders with a Revolving Loan Commitment, equal
      to the Applicable LIBOR Margin for Revolving Loans multiplied by
      the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
      Credit, each such fronting fee or letter of credit fee to be
      payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
      September and December of each Fiscal Year commencing on the
      first such date to occur after the Effective Date, and computed
      on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days
      elapsed; and

             (ii)  with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer of
      each  Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made thereunder
      (without duplication of the fees payable under clause (i) above),
      documentary and processing charges payable directly to the
      applicable Issuing Lender for its own account in accordance with
      such Issuing Lender's standard schedule for such charges in
      effect at the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or
      payment, as the case may be.

For purposes of calculating any fees payable under clauses (i)
and (ii) of this subsection 3.2, the daily amount available to be
drawn under any Letter of Credit shall be determined as of the
close of business on any date of determination.  Promptly upon
receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount described in clause
(i) or (ii) of this subsection 3.2, Administrative Agent shall
distribute to each Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment its
Pro Rata Share of such amount.

       3.3    Drawings and Reimbursement of Amounts Paid Under Letters of
              Credit.

              A.    Responsibility of Issuing Lender With Respect to
Drawings. In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of
Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be
responsible only to examine the documents delivered under such
Letter of Credit with reasonable care to ascertain whether they
appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such Letter of Credit.

              B.    Reimbursement by Borrower of Amounts Paid Under
Letters of Credit.  If an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing
under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall
immediately notify Borrower and Administrative Agent, and
Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender on the date on which
such drawing is honored (the "Reimbursement Date") in an amount
in Dollars and in same day funds equal to the amount of such
honored drawing plus interest thereon as provided in subsection
3.3D(i) for the period from the date of drawing to the date on
which such Revolving Loans are made (the "LC Reimbursement
Amount"); provided that, anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Borrower shall have
notified Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender prior to
12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date such drawing is
honored that Borrower intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender
for the LC Reimbursement Amount with funds other than the
proceeds of Revolving Loans, Borrower shall be deemed to have
given a timely Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent
requesting Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars equal to
the LC Reimbursement Amount (and Administrative Agent shall
promptly give notice thereof to each Lender by telefacsimile or
electronic mail or by telephone promptly confirmed by
telefacsimile or electronic mail) and (ii) subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in subsection
4.2B, Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving
Loans that are Base Rate Loans in the LC Reimbursement Amount,
the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by Administrative
Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender in an amount equal to the
LC Reimbursement Amount; and provided, further that if for any
reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by
Administrative Agent on the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal
to the LC Reimbursement Amount, Borrower shall reimburse
Administrative Agent, on demand, in an amount in same day funds
equal to the excess of (x) the LC Reimbursement Amount over (y)
the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which are
so received.  Nothing in this subsection 3.3B shall be deemed to
relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
Borrower shall retain any and all rights it may have against any
Lender resulting from the failure of such Lender to make such
Revolving Loans under this subsection 3.3B.  The Issuing Lender
may honor or dishonor any drawing in accordance with the terms of
any Letter of Credit without regard to any instruction of the
Borrower.

              C.    Payment by Lenders of Unreimbursed Amounts Paid Under
Letters of Credit.

              (i)   Payment by Lenders.  If Borrower shall fail for any
     reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender (or Administrative Agent) as
     provided in subsection 3.3B in an amount equal to the amount of
     any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of
     Credit issued by it, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
     each other Revolving Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such
     honored drawing and of such other Revolving Lender's respective
     participation therein based on such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata
     Share of the Revolving Loan Commitment by telefacsimile or by
     telephone promptly confirmed by telefacsimile.  Each Revolving
     Lender shall make available to Administrative Agent for the
     account of such Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective
     participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the
     Administrative Agent's office, not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York
     City time) on the Business Day notified by Administrative Agent.
     If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to Administrative
     Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender on such Business Day
     the amount of such Revolving Lender's participation in such
     Letter of Credit as provided in this subsection 3.3C,
     Administrative Agent and/or such Issuing Lender shall be entitled
     to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender
     together with interest thereon at the rate customarily used by
     such Issuing Lender for the correction of errors among banks for
     three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.  Nothing in
     this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the right of
     any Revolving Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any
     amounts made available by such Revolving Lender to such Issuing
     Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.3C if it is determined by
     the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the
     payment with respect to a Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender
     in respect of which payment was made by such Issuing Lender
     constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
     such Issuing Lender.

              (ii)  Distribution to Lenders of Reimbursements Received From
     Borrower.  If Administrative Agent for the account of any Issuing
     Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders
     pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of any
     drawing honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit
     issued by it, Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to
     each other Revolving Lender which has paid all amounts payable by
     it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such honored drawing
     such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving
     Loan Commitment of all payments subsequently received by
     Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender from
     Borrower in reimbursement of such honored drawing when such
     payments are received.  Any such distribution shall be made to a
     Revolving Lender at its primary address set forth below its name
     on the appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address
     as such Lender may request.

              D.    Interest on Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.

              (i)   Payment of Interest by Borrower.  Borrower agrees to pay
     to Administrative Agent on account of each Issuing Lender, with
     respect to drawings honored under any Letters of Credit issued by
     it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing Lender in respect
     of each such honored drawing from the date a drawing is honored
     to but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by Borrower
     (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of
     Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 3.3B) at a rate equal to
     (a) for the period from the date such drawing is honored to but
     excluding the Reimbursement Date, the rate then in effect under
     this Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
     Loans and (b) thereafter, a rate which is 2.00% per annum in
     excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under this
     Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
     Loans.  Interest payable pursuant to this subsection 3.3D(i)
     shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual
     number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues and
     shall be payable on demand or, if no demand is made, on the date
     on which the related drawing under a Letter of Credit is
     reimbursed in full.

              (ii)   Distribution of Interest Payments by Administrative
     Agent.  Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent for the account of
     any Issuing Lender of any payment of interest pursuant to
     subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a drawing honored under a
     Letter of Credit issued by it, (a) Administrative Agent shall
     distribute to each Revolving Lender, out of the interest received
     by Administrative Agent in respect of the period from the date
     such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which such
     Issuing Lender is reimbursed for the amount of such honored
     drawing (including any such reimbursement out of the proceeds of
     Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 3.3B), the amount that
     such other Revolving Lender would have been entitled to receive
     in respect of the letter of credit fee that would have been
     payable in respect of such Letter of Credit for such period
     pursuant to subsection 3.2 if no drawing had been honored under
     such Letter of Credit, and (b) if such Issuing Lender shall have
     been reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection
     3.3C(i) for all or any portion of such honored drawing, such
     Issuing Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account
     of each other Revolving Lender which has paid all amounts payable
     by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such honored
     drawing such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
     Revolving Loan Commitment any interest received by such Issuing
     Lender in respect of that portion of such honored drawing so
     reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders for the period from the
     date on which such Issuing Lender was so reimbursed by other
     Revolving Lenders to but excluding the date on which such portion
     of such honored drawing is reimbursed by Borrower.  Any such
     distribution shall be made to a Revolving Lender at its primary
     address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature
     page hereof or at such other address as such Revolving Lender may
     request.

      3.4    Obligations Absolute.

              The obligation of Borrower to reimburse each Issuing
Lender (or Administrative Agent for the account of each Issuing
Lender) for drawings honored under the Letters of Credit issued
by it and to repay any Revolving Loans made by Revolving Lenders
pursuant to subsection 3.3B and the obligations of Revolving
Lenders under subsection 3.3C(i) shall be unconditional and
irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement under all circumstances including any of
the following circumstances:

              (i)   any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
       Credit;

              (ii)  the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
       right which Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a
       beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any
       Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing
       Lender or other Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a
       Lender, against Borrower, whether in connection with this
       Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated
       transaction (including any underlying transaction between
       Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which
       any Letter of Credit was procured);

              (iii) any draft or other document presented under any Letter
       of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
       insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue
       or inaccurate in any respect;

              (iv)  payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under any Letter
       of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document which
       does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of
       Credit;

              (v)   any adverse change in the business, operations, properties,
       assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
       Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

              (vi)  any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by
       any party thereto;

              (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
       or not similar to any of the foregoing; or

              (viii)the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential Event
       of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

       provided, in each case, that payment by the applicable Issuing
       Lender under the applicable Letter of Credit shall not have
       constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
       Issuing Lender under the circumstances in question (as determined
       by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

       3.5    Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties.

              A.    Indemnification.  In addition to amounts payable as
provided in subsection 3.6, Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify,
pay and save harmless Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender
and each other Lender from and against any and all claims,
demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and
expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements
of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender and each other Lender
may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect,
of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing
Lender, other than as a result of (a) the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender as determined by a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b)
subject to the following clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor by
such Issuing Lender of a proper demand for payment made under any
Letter of Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing
Lender to honor a drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a
result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of
any present or future de jure or de facto Governmental Authority
(all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental Acts").

            B.    Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties.  As between Borrower
and any Issuing Lender, Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Lender by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters
of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for:
(i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection
with the application for and issuance of any such Letter of
Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all
respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;
(ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring
or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter
of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or
ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of
any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions
required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit;
(iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission
or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or
otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in
interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to
make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds
thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such
Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter
of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond
the control of such Issuing Lender, including any Governmental
Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent
the vesting of, any of such Issuing Lender's or any other
Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

              In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of
the specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this
subsection 3.5B, any action taken or omitted by any Issuing
Lender under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued
by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if
taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender
or any other Lender under any resulting liability to Borrower.

              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this subsection 3.5, Borrower shall retain any and all rights it
may have against any Issuing Lender for any liability arising
solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Issuing Lender, as determined by a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

       3.6    Increased Costs and Taxes Relating to Letters of Credit.

          Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which
shall be controlling with respect to the matters covered
thereby), if any Issuing Lender or Lender shall determine (which
determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any law,
treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change
therein or in the interpretation, administration or application
thereof (including the introduction of any new law, treaty or
governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of
a court or governmental authority, in each case that becomes
effective after the date hereof, or compliance by any Issuing
Lender or Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued
or made after the date hereof by any central bank or other
governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not
having the force of law):

              (i)   subjects such Issuing Lender or Lender (or its applicable
     lending or letter of credit office) to any additional Tax (other
     than any Tax on the overall net income of such Issuing Lender or
     Lender) with respect to the issuing or maintaining of any Letters
     of Credit or the purchasing or maintaining of any participations
     therein or any other obligations under this Section 3, whether
     directly or by such being imposed on or suffered by any
     particular Issuing Lender;

              (ii)  imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve
     (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
     reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
     requirement in respect of any Letters of Credit issued by any
     Issuing Lender or participations therein purchased by any Lender; or

              (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to
     a Tax matter) on or affecting such Issuing Lender or Lender (or
     its applicable lending or letter of credit office) regarding this
     Section 3 or any Letter of Credit or any participation therein;

          and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase
the cost to such Issuing Lender or Lender of agreeing to issue,
issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to
purchase, purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or
to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Issuing
Lender or Lender (or its applicable lending or letter of credit
office) with respect thereto; then, in any case, Borrower shall
promptly pay to such Issuing Lender or Lender, upon receipt of
the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional
amount or amounts as may be necessary to compensate such Issuing
Lender or Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in
amounts received or receivable hereunder.  Such Issuing Lender or
Lender shall deliver to Borrower a written statement, setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the
additional amounts owed to such Issuing Lender or Lender under
this subsection 3.6, which statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

              The issuance of any Letter of Credit hereunder (whether
or not the applicable Issuing Lender is obligated to issue such
Letter of Credit) and the renewal of any Letter of Credit
hereunder is subject to the following conditions precedent:

              A.    On or before the date of issuance of the initial Letter of
Credit pursuant to this Agreement, the initial Loans shall have
been made.

              B.    On or before the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit,
Administrative Agent shall have received, in accordance with the

              C.    On the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, all

Section 5.    BORROWER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

              In order to induce Lenders to enter into this Agreement
and to make the Loans, to induce Issuing Lenders to issue Letters
of Credit and to induce other Lenders to purchase participations
therein, Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender, on the
date of this Agreement, on each Funding Date and on the date of
issuance of each Letter of Credit and the renewal of any Letter
of Credit hereunder, that the following statements are true,
correct and complete:

        5.1   Organization, Powers, Qualification, Good Standing, Business
              and Subsidiaries.

              A.    Organization and Powers.  Each Loan Party is a corporation,
partnership, trust or limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization as specified in Schedule 4.1D
annexed hereto.  Each Loan Party has all requisite power and
authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its
business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to
enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to carry
out the transactions contemplated thereby.  Newco has the
requisite power and authority to consummate the Acquisition.

              B.    Qualification and Good Standing.  Each Loan Party is
qualified to do business and in good standing in every
jurisdiction where its assets are located and wherever necessary
to carry out its business and operations, except in jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not
had and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

              C.    Conduct of Business.  Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
engaged only in the businesses permitted to be engaged in
pursuant to subsections 7.13.

              D.    Subsidiaries.  All of the Subsidiaries of Borrower and
their jurisdictions of organization are identified in Schedule 4.1D
annexed hereto, as said Schedule 4.1D may be supplemented from
time to time pursuant to the provisions of subsection 6.1(xv).
The Capital Stock of Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries of
Borrower identified in Schedule 4.1D annexed hereto (as so
supplemented) are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and none of such Capital Stock constitutes Margin
Stock.  Each of the Subsidiaries of Borrower identified in
Schedule 4.1D annexed hereto (as so supplemented) is a
corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its respective jurisdiction of organization set forth therein,
has all requisite power and authority to own and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents to
which it is a party and to carry out the transactions
contemplated thereby, and is qualified to do business and in good
standing in every jurisdiction where its assets are located and
wherever necessary to carry out its business and operations, in
each case except where failure to be so qualified or in good
standing or a lack of such power and authority has not had and
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  Schedule 4.1D annexed hereto (as so supplemented)
correctly sets forth the ownership interest of Borrower and each
of the Subsidiaries of Borrower identified therein.

       5.2    Authorization of Borrowing, etc.

              A.    Authorization of Borrowing and Acquisition.  The execution,
delivery and performance of the Loan Documents have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of each Loan Party
that is a party thereto.  The consummation of the Acquisition has
been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Borrower and Newco.

              B.    No Conflict.  The execution, delivery and performance by
Loan Parties of the Loan Documents to which they are parties and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents and the Acquisition do not and will not (i) violate any
provision of any law or any governmental rule or regulation
applicable to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the
Organizational Documents of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any order, judgment or decree of any court or other
Governmental Authority binding on Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or
constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under any Contractual Obligation of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or require the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Liens created
under any of the Loan Documents in favor of Administrative Agent
on behalf of Lenders), (iv) require any approval of stockholders
or any approval or consent of any Person under any Contractual
Obligation of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except for
such approvals or consents which will be obtained on or before
the Effective Date and disclosed in writing to Lenders or (v)
conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any other
contractual obligation of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
which conflicts, breaches or defaults, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or which would impose any liability upon
Administrative Agent or any Lenders.

              C.    Governmental Consents.  Except as disclosed on Schedule
5.8E, the execution, delivery and performance by Loan Parties of
the Loan Documents to which they are parties and the consummation
of the Acquisition and the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents do not and will not require registration with, consent
or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any
Governmental Authority.

              D.    Binding Obligation.  Each of the Loan Documents has been
duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party that is a party
thereto and is the legally valid and binding obligation of such
Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance
with its respective terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles relating to enforceability.

       5.3    Financial Condition.

              Borrower has heretofore delivered to Lenders, at
Lenders' request, the financial statements and information
required to be delivered pursuant to subsection 4.1E.  All such
statements, other than pro forma financial statements, were
prepared in conformity with GAAP and fairly present the financial
position (on a consolidated and, where applicable, consolidating
basis) of the entities described in such financial statements as
at the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows (on a consolidated and, where applicable,
consolidating basis) of the entities described therein for each
of the periods then ended, subject, in the case of any such
unaudited financial statements, to changes resulting from audit
and normal year-end adjustments.  No Loan Party has (and will not
have following the funding of the initial Loans) any Contingent
Obligation, contingent liability or liability for taxes, long-
term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that, as of
the Effective Date, is not reflected in the foregoing financial
statements or the notes thereto and, as of any Funding Date
subsequent to the Effective Date, is not reflected in the most
recent financial statements delivered to Lenders pursuant to
subsection 6.1 or the notes thereto and that, in any such case,
is material in relation to the business, operations, properties,
assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

       5.4    No Material Adverse Change; No Restricted Junior Payments.

              Except as otherwise disclosed in writing to Lenders,
since June 30, 2002, no event or change has occurred that has
resulted in or evidences, either in any case or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has directly or indirectly declared, ordered, paid
or made, or set apart any sum or property for, any Restricted
Junior Payment or agreed to do so except as permitted by
subsection 7.5.

       5.5    Title to Properties; Liens; Real Property; Intellectual
              Property.

              A.    Title to Properties; Liens.  Borrower and its Subsidiaries
have (i) good, sufficient and legal title to (in the case of fee
interests in real property), (ii) valid leasehold interests in
(in the case of leasehold interests in real or personal
property), or (iii) good title to (in the case of all other
personal property), all of their respective properties and assets
reflected in the financial statements referred to in subsection
5.3 or in the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant
to subsection 6.1, in each case except for assets disposed of
since the date of such financial statements in the ordinary
course of business or as otherwise permitted under subsection
7.7.  Except as permitted by this Agreement, all such properties
and assets are free and clear of Liens.

              B.    Real Property.  As of the Effective Date, Schedule 5.5B
annexed hereto contains a true, accurate and complete list of (i)
all fee interests in any Real Property Assets and (ii) all
leases, subleases or assignments of leases (together with all
amendments, modifications, supplements, renewals or extensions of
any thereof) affecting each Real Property Asset, regardless of
whether a Loan Party is the landlord or tenant (whether directly
or as an assignee or successor in interest) under such lease,
sublease or assignment.  Except as specified in Schedule 5.5B
annexed hereto, each agreement listed in clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence is in full force and effect and
Borrower does not have knowledge of any default that has occurred
and is continuing thereunder, and each such agreement constitutes
the legally valid and binding obligation of each applicable Loan
Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its
terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating
to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable
principles relating to enforceability.  If Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries acquires any additional Real Property Assets after
the Effective Date, Borrower shall deliver an updated Schedule
5.5B.

              C.    Intellectual Property.  As of the Effective Date, Borrower
and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use, all
Intellectual Property used in or necessary to the conduct of
their business.  No claim has been asserted and is pending by any
Person challenging or questioning the use of any such
Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any
such Intellectual Property, nor does Borrower know of any valid
basis for any such claim except for such claims that individually
or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.  The use of such Intellectual Property
by Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights
of any Person, except for such claims and infringements that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  All federal and
state and all foreign registrations of and applications for
Intellectual Property that are owned or licensed by Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries on the Effective Date are described on
Schedule 5.5C annexed hereto.

       5.6    Litigation; Adverse Facts.

              Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.6, there are no
Proceedings (whether or not purportedly on behalf of Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries) at law or in equity, or before or by any
court or other Governmental Authority (including any
Environmental Claims) that are pending or, to the knowledge of
Borrower, threatened against or affecting Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries and that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is in violation
of any applicable laws (including Environmental Laws) that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) is subject to or in
default with respect to any final judgments, writs, injunctions,
decrees, rules or regulations of any court or other Governmental
Authority, that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

       5.7    Payment of Taxes.

              Except to the extent permitted by subsection 6.3 and
except as set forth on Schedule 5.7, all tax returns and reports
of Borrower and its Subsidiaries required to be filed by any of
them have been timely filed, and all taxes shown on such tax
returns to be due and payable and all assessments, fees and other
governmental charges upon Borrower and its Subsidiaries and upon
their respective properties, assets, income, businesses and
franchises that are due and payable have been paid when due and
payable, except for such taxes (i) which are not yet delinquent
or (ii) that are being contested in good faith and by proper
proceeds, and against which adequate reserves or other
appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be required in
conformity with GAAP shall have been made or provided therefor.
Borrower knows of no proposed tax assessment against Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries that is not being actively contested by
Borrower or such Subsidiary in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings.

       5.8    Performance of Agreements; Materially Adverse Agreements;
              Material Contracts; Government Contracts.

              A.    Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any of its
Contractual Obligations, and no condition exists that, with the
giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute
such a default, except where the consequences, direct or
indirect, of such default or defaults, if any, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

              B.    Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or is otherwise subject to any agreements or instruments or any
charter or other internal restrictions or any provision of any
applicable law, rule or regulation which, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

              C.    Schedule 5.8C contains a true, correct and complete list
of all the Material Contracts in effect on the Effective Date.  All
such Material Contracts are in full force and effect and no
defaults currently exist thereunder, except for defaults that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be deemed
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

              D.    Schedule 5.8D contains a true, correct and complete
list of all Government Contracts.  Except as otherwise set forth on
Schedule 5.8D, each such Government Contract is assignable to
Administrative Agent and Lenders pursuant to the Assignment of
Claims Act.  No notice of suspension, debarment, cure notice,
show cause notice or notice of termination for default with
respect to any Government Contract with Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, and neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
party to any pending, or to Borrower's or any Subsidiary's
knowledge, threatened, suspension, debarment, or termination for
default issued by the U.S. government or other adverse U.S.
government action or proceeding in connection with any Government
Contract.

              E.    Schedule 5.8E contains a true, correct and complete
list of all Government Contracts assigned, transferred or otherwise
acquired in connection with the Acquisition and indicates whether
or not such Government Contracts require novation.

       5.9    Governmental Regulation.

              Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act or the
Investment Company Act of 1940 or under any other federal or
state statute or regulation which may limit its ability to incur
Indebtedness or which may otherwise render all or any portion of
the Obligations unenforceable.

       5.10   Securities Activities.

              A.    Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any Margin Stock.

              B.    Following application of the proceeds of each Loan,
not more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of Borrower only or
of Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) subject
to the provisions of subsection 7.2 or 7.7 or subject to any
restriction contained in any agreement or instrument, between
Borrower and any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender, relating
to Indebtedness and within the scope of subsection 8.2, will be
Margin Stock.

       5.11   Employee Benefit Plans.

              A.    Borrower, each of its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable provisions and requirements of ERISA
and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with
respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, and have performed all
their obligations under each Employee Benefit Plan, except where
the failure to perform such obligations could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Each Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified, or, to the extent it
is not so qualified by reason of a form defect, the remedial
amendment period under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(b)
within which to correct a disqualifying provision has not yet
expired, or to the extent it is not qualified for reasons other
than form defects, such defects can be corrected without a
Material Adverse Effect.

              B.    No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur.

              C.    Except to the extent required under Section 4980B of the
Internal Revenue Code or except as set forth in Schedule 5.11
annexed hereto, no Employee Benefit Plan provides health or
welfare benefits (through the purchase of insurance or otherwise)
for any retired or former employee of Borrower or, any of its
Subsidiaries.

              D.    As of the most recent valuation date for any Pension Plan,
(i) the excess of (a) the actuarial present value (determined on
the basis of reasonable assumptions employed by the independent
actuary for such Pension Plan for purposes of Section 412 of the
Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA) of benefit
liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) over (b)
the fair market value of the assets of such Pension Plan (the
"Unfunded Benefit Liability"), individually or in the aggregate
for all Pension Plans to which Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries have ever contributed, and (ii) the potential
liability that Borrower and its Subsidiaries could reasonably be
expected to incur as the result of the Unfunded Benefit
Liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, for all Pension
Plans to which neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
ever contributed, excluding for purposes of such computations any
Pension Plans with respect to which assets exceed benefit
liabilities, do not exceed $2,000,000.

              E.    As of the most recent valuation date of each Multiemployer
Plan for which the actuarial report is available, the potential
liability of Borrower, its Subsidiaries of any of their ERISA
Affiliates for a complete withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan
(within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA), when aggregate
with such potential liability for complete withdrawal for all
Multiemployer Plans, based on information available pursuant to
Section 4221(e) of ERISA, does not exceed $2,000,000.

       5.12   Certain Fees.

              No broker's or finder's fee or commission will be
payable by any Loan Party with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, and
Borrower hereby indemnifies Lenders against, and agrees that it
will hold Lenders harmless from, any claim, demand or liability
for any such broker's or finder's fees alleged to have been
incurred in connection herewith or therewith and any expenses
(including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of
counsel) arising in connection with any such claim, demand or
liability.

       5.13   Environmental Protection.

       Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.13,

              (i)   (x) neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or
       operations are subject to any outstanding written order, consent
       decree or settlement agreement with any Person relating to any
       Environmental Law, any Environmental Claim, or any Hazardous
       Materials Activity and (y) none of Borrower's or its
       Subsidiaries' respective Facilities are subject to any
       outstanding written order, consent decree or settlement agreement
       with any Person relating to any Environmental Law, any
       Environmental Claim, or any Hazardous Materials Activity arising
       from Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' activities or
       operations;

              (ii)  neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
       received any letter or request for information under Section 104
       of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
       Liability Act (42 U.S.C. Section 9604) or any comparable state law;

              (iii) there are and, to Borrower's knowledge, have been no
       conditions, occurrences, or Hazardous Materials Activities that
       could reasonably be expected to form the basis of an
       Environmental Claim against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

              (iv)  Borrower has maintained an environmental health and
       safety management system for its and each of its Subsidiaries'
       operations that demonstrates a commitment to environmental
       compliance and includes procedures for (a) preparing and updating
       written compliance manuals covering pertinent regulatory areas,
       (b) tracking changes in applicable Environmental Laws and
       modifying operations to comply with new requirements thereunder,
       (c) training employees to comply with applicable environmental
       requirements and updating such training as necessary, (d)
       performing regular internal compliance audits of each Facility
       and ensuring correction of any incidents of non-compliance
       detected by means of such audits, and (e) reviewing the
       compliance status of off-site waste disposal facilities;

              (v)  Compliance with all current or reasonably foreseeable
       future requirements pursuant to or under Environmental Laws would not,
       individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
       result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Nothing in this subsection
       5.13 to the contrary, no event or condition has occurred or is
       occurring with respect to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
       relating to any Environmental Law, any Release of Hazardous
       Materials, or any Hazardous Materials Activity, which
       individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to
       have a Material Adverse Effect;

              (vi)  To Borrower's and each of its Subsidiary's knowledge, all
       Real Property Assets and all operations of Borrower and its
       Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have in the last five years
       been compliance, with Environmental Laws, except where such
       failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to have a
       Material Adverse Effect; and

              (vii) No judicial proceeding or action by any Governmental
       Authority is pending, or to the knowledge of Borrower and each of
       its Subsidiaries, threatened, under any Environmental Law to
       which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is or will be named as
       a party.

       5.14   Employee Matters.

              There are no collective bargaining agreements covering
the employees of Borrower and its Subsidiaries except as set
forth on Schedule 5.14.  There is no strike or work stoppage in
existence or threatened involving Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, and there are no strikes or walkouts in
progress, pending or to Borrower's knowledge contemplated
relating to any labor contracts to which Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, relating to any labor contracts being
negotiated, or otherwise.

       5.15   Solvency.

              Each Loan Party (other than T-S Holding) is and, upon
the incurrence of any Obligations by such Loan Party on any date
on which this representation is made, will be, Solvent.  Borrower
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole are and, upon the
incurrence of any Obligations by Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole on any date on which this representation is
made, will be, Solvent.

       5.16   Matters Relating to Collateral.

              A.    Creation, Perfection and Priority of Liens.
The execution and delivery of the Collateral Documents by Loan Parties,
together with (i) the actions taken on or prior to the date
hereof pursuant to subsections 4.1L, 6.8 and 6.9 and (ii) the
delivery to Administrative Agent of any Pledged Collateral not
delivered to Administrative Agent at the time of execution and
delivery of the applicable Collateral Document (all of which
Pledged Collateral has been so delivered) are effective to create
in favor of Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders, as
security for the respective Secured Obligations (as defined in
the applicable Collateral Document in respect of any Collateral),
a valid and perfected First Priority Lien on all of the
Collateral, and all filings and other actions necessary or
desirable to perfect and maintain the perfection and First
Priority status of such Liens have been duly made or taken and
remain in full force and effect, other than the filing of any UCC
financing statements delivered to Administrative Agent for filing
(but not yet filed) and the periodic filing of UCC continuation
statements in respect of UCC financing statements filed by or on
behalf of Administrative Agent.

              B.    Governmental Authorizations.  No authorization,
approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required for either (i) the pledge or
grant by any Loan Party of the Liens purported to be created in
favor of Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders pursuant
to any of the Collateral Documents or (ii) the exercise by
Administrative Agent of any rights or remedies in respect of any
Collateral (whether specifically granted or created pursuant to
any of the Collateral Documents or created or provided for by
applicable law), except for (a) filings or recordings
contemplated by subsection 5.16A, (b) as may be required, in
connection with the disposition of any Pledged Collateral, by
laws generally affecting the offering and sale of securities, and
(c) with respect to clause (ii) above, for filings required under
the Assignment of Claims Act.

              C.    Absence of Third-Party Filings.  Except such as
may have been filed in favor of Administrative Agent for the benefit of
Lenders as contemplated by subsection 5.16A and to evidence
permitted lease obligations and other Liens permitted pursuant to
subsection 7.2, (i) no effective UCC financing statement, fixture
filing or other instrument similar in effect covering all or any
part of the Collateral is on file in any filing or recording
office and (ii) no effective filing covering all or any part of
the IP Collateral is on file in the PTO.

              D.    Margin Regulations.  The pledge of the Pledged
Collateral pursuant to the Collateral Documents does not violate
Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

              E.    Information Regarding Collateral.  All information
supplied to Administrative Agent by or on behalf of any Loan Party with
respect to any of the Collateral (in each case taken as a whole
with respect to any particular Collateral) is accurate and
complete in all material respects.

       5.17   Consummation of the Acquisition.

              The Acquisition has been consummated or will close
simultaneously with the transactions contemplated hereby.

       5.18   Accounts Receivable.

              Each Account reflected in the computations included in
any Borrowing Base Certificate meets the criteria of the
definition of Eligible Account Receivable or Eligible Unbilled
Accounts Receivable, except as disclosed in such Borrowing Base
Certificate or as disclosed in a timely manner in a subsequent
Borrowing Base Certificate or otherwise in writing to
Administrative Agent.  Borrower has no knowledge of any fact or
circumstance not disclosed to Administrative Agent in a Borrowing
Base Certificate or otherwise in writing which would impair the
validity or collectibility of any Eligible Account Receivable of
$50,000 or more or of Eligible Accounts Receivable which
(regardless of the individual amount thereof) aggregate $250,000
or more.

       5.19   Inventory.

              All Inventory included in any Borrowing Base
Certificate delivered to Administrative Agent meets the criteria
of the definition of Eligible Inventory, except as disclosed in
such Borrowing Base Certificate or in a subsequent Borrowing Base
Certificate, or as otherwise specifically disclosed in writing to
the Administrative Agent.

       5.20   Disclosure.

              No representation or warranty of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in any Loan Document or in any other document,
certificate or written statement furnished to Lenders by or on
behalf of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact (known to Borrower, in the case of any
document not furnished by it) necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances in which the same were made.  Any projections
and pro forma financial information contained in such materials
are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by
Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized
by Lenders that such projections as to future events are not to
be viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or
periods covered by any such projections may differ from the
projected results.  There are no facts known (or which should
upon the reasonable exercise of diligence be known) to Borrower
(other than matters of a general economic nature) that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect and that have not been
disclosed herein or in such other documents, certificates and
statements furnished to Lenders for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

       5.21   Mortgage Taxes, Etc.

              All mortgage, note, transfer, documentary, stamp,
intangible and other similar taxes and impositions which may be
required to be paid in connection with the Loans, the Mortgages
and the other Loan Documents have been (or concurrently with the
closing of the Loans and recording of the Mortgages, will be)
paid in full by Borrower.

       5.22   Proceeds of Loan.

              The proceeds of the Loans will be used solely by
Borrower for the purposes set forth in Section 2.5.

forth herein or in the schedules hereto, each of the
representations and warranties given by Seller to Borrower in the
Acquisition Agreement is true and correct in all material
respects as of the date hereof (or as of any earlier date to
which such representation and warranty specifically relates) and
will be true and correct in all material respects as of the
Effective Date (or as of such earlier date, as the case may be),
in each case subject to the qualifications set forth in the
schedules to the Acquisition Agreement.

          C.   Warranties of Borrower.  Subject to the qualifications set
forth therein, each of the representations and warranties given
by Borrower to Seller in the Acquisition Agreement is true and
correct in all material respects as of the date hereof and will

     examination nothing has come to their attention that causes them

effect its existence in the jurisdiction of organization

to its business; provided, however that neither Borrower nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to preserve any such right
or franchise if the Governing Body of Borrower or such Subsidiary

of its income, businesses or franchises before any penalty
accrues thereon, and all claims (including claims for labor,
services, materials and supplies) for sums that have become due
and payable and that by law have or may become a Lien upon any of
its properties or assets, prior to the time when any penalty or
fine shall be incurred with respect thereto; provided that no
such tax, assessment, charge or claim need be paid if it is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly
instituted and diligently conducted, so long as (i) such reserve
or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in
conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor and (ii) in
the case of a tax, assessment, charge or claim which has or may
become a Lien against any of the Collateral, such proceedings
conclusively operate to stay the sale of any portion of the
Collateral to satisfy such charge or claim.

              B.    Borrower will not, nor will it permit any of its

              (i)   Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
     to, maintain or cause to be maintained in good repair, working order
     and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, all material
     properties used or useful in the business of Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries (other than any Intellectual Property) and from time
     to time will make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs,
     renewals and replacements thereof.

              (ii)  Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall (a) prosecute, file
     and/or make (i) all applications relating to the Intellectual
     Property owned, held or used by Borrower or its Subsidiaries that
     is pending as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) all
     registrations of any existing or future unregistered or
     copyrightable works and (iii) all Trademark opposition and

     necessary or desirable to preserve and maintain all rights in all
     Intellectual Property, except in each case under clause (a) or
     clause (b) where the failure could not reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect.  Any expenses incurred in
     connection therewith shall be borne solely be Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries.

              B.    Insurance.  Borrower will maintain or cause to be
maintained, with financially sound and reputable insurers, such
public liability insurance, third party property damage
insurance, business interruption insurance and casualty insurance
with respect to liabilities, losses or damage in respect of the
assets, properties and businesses of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as may customarily be carried or maintained under
similar circumstances by corporations of established reputation
engaged in similar businesses, in each case in such amounts
(giving effect to self-insurance, to the extent companies of
similar size and in similar businesses self-insure), with such
deductibles, covering such risks and otherwise on such terms and
conditions as shall be customary for corporations similarly
situated in the industry.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Borrower will maintain or cause to be maintained
(i) flood insurance with respect to each Flood Hazard Property
that is located in a community that participates in the National
Flood Insurance Program, in each case in compliance with any
applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, and (ii) replacement value casualty insurance on
the Collateral under such policies of insurance, with such
insurance companies, in such amounts, with such deductibles,
covering such risks and having other terms and conditions as are
at all times satisfactory to Administrative Agent in its
commercially reasonable judgment. Each such policy of insurance
shall (a) name Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders as
an additional insured thereunder as its interests may appear and
(b) in the case of each business interruption and casualty
insurance policy, contain a loss payable clause or endorsement,
satisfactory in form and substance to Administrative Agent, that
names Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders as the loss
payee thereunder for any covered loss in excess of $500,000 and
provides for at least 30 days prior written notice to
Administrative Agent of any modification or cancellation of such
policy.

              C.    Application of Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds.

              (i)   Business Interruption Insurance.  Upon receipt by Borrower
     or any of its Subsidiaries of any business interruption insurance
     proceeds constituting Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, (a) so
     long as no Event of Default or no Potential Event of Default
     shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower or such
     Subsidiary may retain and apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation
     Proceeds for working capital purposes, and (b) if an Event of
     Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing, Borrower shall apply an amount equal to such Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to prepay the Loans (and/or the
     Revolving Loan Commitments shall be reduced) as provided in
     subsection 2.4B.

              (ii)  Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds Received by Borrower.
     Upon receipt by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds other than from business
     interruption insurance, (a) so long as no Event of Default or
     Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
     if the Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are less than
     $500,000,  Borrower shall, or shall cause one or more of its
     Subsidiaries to, promptly and diligently apply such Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to pay or reimburse the costs of
     repairing, restoring or replacing the assets in respect of which
     such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received or, to the
     extent not so applied, to prepay the Loans (and/or the Revolving
     Loan Commitments shall be reduced) as provided in subsection
     2.4B, and (b) if an Event of Default or Potential Event of
     Default shall have occurred and be continuing or the Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are greater than or equal to
     $500,000, Borrower shall apply an amount equal to such Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to prepay the Loans (and/or the
     Revolving Loan Commitments shall be reduced) as provided in
     subsection 2.4B.  If at any time Administrative Agent reasonably
     determines (A) that Borrower or such Subsidiary is not proceeding
     diligently with such repair, restoration or replacement or (B)
     that such repair, restoration or replacement cannot be completed
     with the Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds received, together
     with funds otherwise available to Borrower for such purpose, or
     that such repair, restoration or replacement cannot be completed
     within 180 days after the receipt by Borrower or such Subsidiary
     of such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds (unless during such
     180 day period Borrower or such Subsidiary commences such repair,
     restoration or replacement and diligently pursues the same to
     completion), then Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and
     Borrower shall apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to
     prepay the Loans (and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be
     reduced) as provided in subsection 2.4B.

              (iii)  Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds Received by
     Administrative Agent.  Upon receipt by Administrative Agent of
     any Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds as loss payee, (a) if the
     aggregate amount of Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds received
     (and reasonably expected to be received) by Administrative Agent
     in respect of any covered loss exceeds $500,000, or if and to the
     extent Borrower would have been required to apply such Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds (if it had received them
     directly) to prepay the Loans and/or reduce the Revolving Loan
     Commitments, Administrative Agent shall, and Borrower hereby
     authorizes Administrative Agent to, apply such Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to prepay the Loans (and/or the
     Revolving Loan Commitments shall be reduced) as provided in
     subsection 2.4B, and (b) to the extent the foregoing clause (a)
     does not apply, Administrative Agent shall deliver such Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to Borrower, and if such proceeds
     are business interruption proceeds constituting Net
     Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Borrower or such Subsidiary may
     retain and apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds for
     working capital purposes, or, if such Net Insurance/Condemnation
     Proceeds are other than from business interruption insurance,
     Borrower shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries
     to, promptly apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to
     the costs of repairing, restoring, or replacing the assets in
     respect of which such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were
     received; provided, however, that if at any time Administrative
     Agent reasonably determines (A) that Borrower or such Subsidiary
     is not proceeding diligently with such repair, restoration or
     replacement or (B) that such repair, restoration or replacement
     cannot be completed with the Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds
     then held by Administrative Agent for such purpose, together with
     funds otherwise available to Borrower for such purpose, or that
     such repair, restoration or replacement cannot be completed
     within 180 days after the receipt by Administrative Agent of such
     Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Administrative Agent shall,
     and Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to, apply
     such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to prepay the Loans
     (and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be reduced) as
     provided in subsection 2.4B(iii)(b).

     Subsidiaries  to modify current operations in a manner that could

     Subsidiaries to any  material additional obligations or
     requirements under any Environmental Laws.

conducted at the request of Administrative Agent pursuant to this
subsection 6.7C will be obtained and shall be used by
Administrative Agent and Lenders for the purposes of Lenders'
internal credit decisions, to monitor and police the Loans and to
protect Lenders' security interests, if any, created by the Loan
Documents.  Administrative Agent agrees to deliver a copy of any
such report to Borrower with the understanding that Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that (x) it will indemnify and hold
harmless Administrative Agent and each Lender from any costs,
losses or liabilities relating to Borrower's use of or reliance
on such report, (y) neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender
makes any representation or warranty with respect to such report,
and (z) by delivering such report to Borrower, neither
Administrative Agent nor any Lender is requiring or recommending
the implementation of any suggestions or recommendations
contained in such report.

Lenders, a valid and perfected First Priority Lien on 65% of the

              A.    Additional Mortgages, Etc.  From and after the Effective

good faith, but are unable, to obtain such lessor's or senior
lienholder's consent after use of their best efforts (any such
non-excluded Real Property Asset described in the foregoing

within 30 days after receiving a written request by
Administrative Agent to do so, transfer all amounts in the
applicable Deposit Account to a Deposit Account maintained at a
financial institution from which Borrower or such Subsidiary has
obtained such an agreement.  Borrower shall not permit the

permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien on or with
respect to any property or asset of any kind (including any
document or instrument in respect of goods or accounts
receivable) of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom
or proceeds thereof, or file or permit the filing of, or permit
to remain in effect, any financing statement or other similar
notice of any Lien with respect to any such property, asset,
income or profits or proceeds under the UCC or under any similar
recording or notice statute, except:

              (i)   Permitted Encumbrances;

              (ii)  Liens granted pursuant to the Collateral Documents;

              (iii) Liens existing on the Effective Date and set forth on
     Schedule 7.2A; provided that (a) no such Lien shall at any time
     be extended to cover property or assets other than the property
     or assets subject thereto on the Effective Date and (b) the
     principal amount of the Indebtedness secured by such Liens shall

     within ten days after the acquisition thereof and only to the
     asset acquired with the proceeds of such Indebtedness.

any of its Subsidiaries shall create or assume any Lien upon any of its
properties or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
other than Liens excepted by the provisions of subsection 7.2A,
Borrower or its Subsidiary shall make or cause to be made
effective provision whereby the Obligations will be secured by
such Lien equally and ratably with any and all other Indebtedness
secured thereby as long as any such Indebtedness shall be so
secured which provision shall not cure any default that may have
occurred and which provision shall be made without prejudice to
any rights of Administrative Agent or Lenders with respect to
such default; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this
covenant shall not be construed as a consent by Requisite Lenders
to the creation or assumption of any such Lien not permitted by
the provisions of subsection 7.2A.

              C.    No Further Negative Pledges.  Neither Borrower nor

particular Indebtedness or to be sold pursuant to an executed
agreement with respect to an Asset Sale permitted by this
Agreement.

Borrower or Other Subsidiaries.  Borrower will not, and will not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction of any kind on the ability of any such Subsidiary to
(i) pay dividends or make any other distributions on any of such
Subsidiary's Capital Stock owned by Borrower or any other
Subsidiary of Borrower, (ii) repay or prepay any Indebtedness
owed by such Subsidiary to Borrower or any other Subsidiary of

to bind Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election
of Requisite Lenders and are not intended, directly or

any time be construed so as to grant Borrower the right to
require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder or
to preclude Administrative Agent or Lenders from exercising any
of the rights or remedies available to them under any of the Loan
Documents, even if the conditions set forth in this paragraph are
met.

Section 9.    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

       9.1    Appointment.

        A.    Appointment of Administrative Agent.  CIBC is hereby
appointed Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents and each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent
to act as its administrative agent in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Administrative
Agent agrees to act upon the express conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as applicable.  The
provisions of this Section 9 are solely for the benefit of
Administrative Agent and Lenders and no Loan Party shall have any
rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions
thereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this
Agreement, Administrative Agent shall act solely as an
Administrative Agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not
be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship
of agency or trust with or for Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries.

        B.    Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents.  It is the
purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there
shall be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or
restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to
transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction.  It
is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the
enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case
Administrative Agent deems that by reason of any present or
future law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the
rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other
Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or
necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that
Administrative Agent appoint an additional individual or
institution as a separate trustee, co-trustee, collateral agent
or collateral co-administrative agent (any such additional
individual or institution being referred to herein individually
as a "Supplemental Collateral Agent" and collectively as
"Supplemental Collateral Agents").

              If Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental
Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and
every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised
by or vested in or conveyed to Administrative Agent with respect
to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such
Supplemental Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the
extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral Agent to
exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such
Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such
Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the
Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance
thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run to and be
enforceable by either Administrative Agent or such Supplemental
Collateral Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 9 and
of subsections 10.2 and 10.3 that refer to Administrative Agent
shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral Agent
and all references therein to Administrative Agent shall be
deemed to be references to Administrative Agent and/or such
Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require.

              Should any instrument in writing from Borrower or any
other Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent
so appointed by Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly
vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers,
privileges and duties, Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan
Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such
instruments promptly upon request by Administrative Agent.  In
case any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a successor thereto,
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental
Collateral Agent, to the extent permitted by law, shall vest in
and be exercised by Administrative Agent until the appointment of
a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

       9.2    Powers and Duties; General Immunity.

        A.    Powers; Duties Specified.  Each Lender irrevocably
authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action on such
Lender's behalf and to exercise such powers, rights and remedies
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as are specifically
delegated or granted to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof
and thereof, together with such powers, rights and remedies as
are reasonably incidental thereto.  Administrative Agent shall
have only those duties and responsibilities that are expressly
specified in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Administrative Agent may exercise such powers, rights and
remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or
employees.  Administrative Agent shall not have, by reason of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, expressed or
implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose
upon Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents except as expressly
set forth herein or therein.

        B.    No Responsibility for Certain Matters.  Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible to any Lender for the execution,
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or
statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral
statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments,
reports or certificates or any other documents furnished or made
by Administrative Agent to Lenders or by or on behalf of Borrower
to Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loan
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the
financial condition or business affairs of Borrower or any other
Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall
Administrative Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions,
provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Loan
Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans the use
of the Letters of Credit or as to the existence or possible
existence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default.
Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, Administrative Agent shall not have any
liability arising from confirmations of the amount of outstanding
Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts
thereof.

        C.    Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither Administrative Agent nor
any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be
liable to Lenders for any action taken or omitted by
Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the Loan
Documents except to the extent caused by Administrative Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any
action (including the failure to take an action) in connection
with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or from
the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it
hereunder or thereunder unless and until Administrative Agent
shall have received instructions in respect thereof from
Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to
give such instructions under subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt
of such instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other
Lenders, as the case may be), Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or
to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance
with such instructions.  Without prejudice to the generality of
the foregoing, (i) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
communication, instrument or document believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
person or persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be
protected in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who
may be attorneys for Borrower and its Subsidiaries), accountants,
experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and
(ii) no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against
Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agent acting
or (where so instructed) refraining from acting under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with
the instructions of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as
may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6).

        D.    Administrative Agent Entitled to Act as Lender.  The agency
hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights
and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon,
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender
hereunder.  With respect to its participation in the Loans and
the Letters of Credit, Administrative Agent shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not performing the duties and
functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly
otherwise indicates, include Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity.  Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with
Borrower or any of its Affiliates as if it were not performing
the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other
consideration from Borrower for services in connection with this
Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to
Lenders.

       9.3    Representations and Warranties; No Responsibility For
              Appraisal of Creditworthiness.

              Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made
its own independent investigation of the financial condition and
affairs of Borrower and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
making of the Loans hereunder and that it has made and shall
continue to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries.  Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such
appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender with any
credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming
into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time
or times thereafter, and Administrative Agent shall not have any
responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the
completeness of any information provided to Lenders.

       9.4    Right to Indemnity.

              Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share,
severally agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent and its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, professional
advisors and affiliates, to the extent that Administrative Agent
or such Person shall not have been reimbursed by Borrower, for
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
(including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against Administrative Agent in exercising its
powers, rights and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or
under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity as
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction.  If any indemnity furnished to Administrative Agent
or any other such Person for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired,
Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease,
or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such
additional indemnity is furnished.

       9.5    Successor Administrative Agent.

        A.    Successor Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice
thereof to Lenders and Borrower, and Administrative Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by an instrument or
concurrent instruments in writing delivered to Borrower and
Administrative Agent and signed by Requisite Lenders.  Upon any
such notice of resignation or any such removal, Requisite Lenders
shall have the right, upon five Business Days' notice to
Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent.  Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder
by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring or removed Administrative Agent and the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations under this Agreement.  After any retiring or
removed Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder
as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

       9.6    Collateral Documents and Subsidiary Guaranty.

              Each Lender hereby further authorizes Administrative
Agent, on behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into
each Collateral Document as secured party and to be
Administrative Agent for and representative of Lenders under the
Subsidiary Guaranty, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the
terms of each Collateral Document and the Subsidiary Guaranty;
provided that Administrative Agent shall not (i) enter into or
consent to any material amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision contained in any Collateral Document or
any of the Subsidiary Guaranty or (ii) release any Collateral or
Subsidiary Guarantor (except as otherwise expressly permitted or
required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
applicable Collateral Document), in each case without the prior
consent of Requisite Lenders (or, if required pursuant to
subsection 10.6, all Lenders); provided further, however, that,
without further written consent or authorization from Lenders,
Administrative Agent may execute any documents or instruments
necessary to (a) release any Lien encumbering any item of
Collateral that is the subject of a sale or other disposition of
assets permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders
have otherwise consented, (b) release any Subsidiary Guarantor
from the Subsidiary Guaranty if all of the Capital Stock of such
Subsidiary Guarantor is sold to any Person (other than an
Affiliate of Borrower) pursuant to a sale or other disposition
permitted hereunder or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise
consented or (c) subordinate the Liens of Administrative Agent,
on behalf of Lenders, to any Liens permitted by subsection 7.2
provided that, in the case of a sale of such item of Collateral
or stock referred to in subclause (a) or (b), the requirements of
subsection 10.14 are satisfied.  Anything contained in any of the
Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower,
Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (X) no
Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any of
the Collateral under any Collateral Document or to enforce any
Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights
and remedies under the Collateral Documents and the Subsidiary
Guaranty may be exercised solely by Administrative Agent for the
benefit of Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y)
in the event of a foreclosure by Administrative Agent on any of
the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale,
Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or
all of such Collateral at any such sale and Administrative Agent,
as Administrative Agent for and representative of Lenders (but
not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual
capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree in
writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making
settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any
portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use
and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the
purchase price for any Collateral payable by Administrative Agent
at such sale.

       9.7    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.

              In case of the pendency of any receivership,
insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries of Borrower, Administrative
Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall
then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall
have made any demand on Borrower) shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

              (i)   to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
     principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and any
     other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such
     other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in
     order to have the claims of Lenders and Agents (including any
     claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
     and advances of Lenders and Agents and their agents and counsel
     and all other amounts due Lenders and Agents under subsections
     2.3 and 10.2) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

              (ii)  to collect and receive any moneys or other property
     payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,
sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such
payments to Administrative Agent and, if Administrative Agent
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to Lenders,
to pay to Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Agents and
their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due Agents under
subsections 2.3 and 10.2.

          Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or
adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations
or the rights of any Lenders or to authorize Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

Section 10.   MISCELLANEOUS

       10.1   Assignments and Participations in Loans and Letters of
              Credit.

         A.   General.  Subject to subsections 10.1B and 10.1C, each
Lender shall have the right at any time to (i) sell, assign or
transfer to any Eligible Assignee, or (ii) sell participations to
any Person in, all or any part of its Commitments or any Loan or
Loans made by it or its Letters of Credit (or participations in
Letters of Credit) or any other interest herein or in any other
Obligations owed to it; provided that no such sale, assignment,
transfer or participation shall, without the consent of Borrower,
require Borrower to file a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify such sale,
assignment, transfer or participation under the securities laws
of any state; provided, further, that no such sale, assignment or
transfer described in clause (i) above shall be effective unless
and until an Assignment Agreement effecting such sale, assignment
or transfer shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent and
recorded in the Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii); and
provided, further, that no such sale, assignment or transfer of
any Letter of Credit or any participation therein may be made
separately from a sale, assignment, transfer or participation of
a corresponding interest in the Revolving Loan Commitment and the
Revolving Loans of the Lender effecting such sale, assignment,
transfer or participation.  Except as otherwise provided in this
subsection 10.1, no Lender shall, as between Borrower and such
Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a
result of any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any granting of
participations in, all or any part of its Commitments or the
Loans, or participations therein, or the other Obligations owed
to such Lender, and such Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance of such Obligations, and Borrower shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.

         B.   Assignments.

             (i)  Amounts and Terms of Assignments.  Each Commitment or Loan
     may (a) be assigned in any amount to another Lender, or to an
     Affiliate or Approved Fund of the assigning Lender or another
     Lender, with the giving of notice to Borrower and Administrative
     Agent or (b) be assigned in an aggregate amount of not less than
     $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as shall constitute the
     aggregate amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning
     Lender) to any other Eligible Assignee treating any two or more
     Approved Funds with the same investment advisor as a single
     Eligible Assignee with the consent of Borrower (unless a
     Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default has occurred
     and is continuing) and Administrative Agent (which consent of
     Borrower and Administrative Agent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld or delayed); provided that each partial assignment shall
     be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
     assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
     To the extent of any such assignment in accordance with either
     clause (a) or (b) above, the assigning Lender shall be relieved
     of its obligations with respect to its Commitments or Loans or
     the portion thereof so assigned.  The parties to each such
     assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent, for
     its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment
     Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of
     $3,500 and such forms (including an administrative questionnaire
     if the Eligible Assignee is not a Lender), certificates or other
     evidence, if any, with respect to United States federal income
     tax withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment
     Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent
     pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).  Upon such execution,
     delivery, acceptance and recordation, from and after the
     effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement, (y) the
     assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
     that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it
     pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and
     obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (z) the assigning Lender
     thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
     hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment
     Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which
     survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection 10.9B)
     and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and,
     in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the
     remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
     hereto; provided that, anything contained in any of the Loan
     Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if such Lender is the
     Issuing Lender with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit
     such Lender shall continue to have all rights and obligations of
     an Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit until
     the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and the
     reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder).  The Commitments
     hereunder shall be modified to reflect the Commitment of such
     assignee and any remaining Commitment of such assigning Lender
     and, if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of any
     Notes hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the
     effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as
     practicable, surrender its applicable Notes, if any, to
     Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes
     shall, if so requested by the assignee and/or the assigning
     Lender in accordance with subsection 2.1E, be issued to the
     assignee and/or to the assigning Lender, substantially in the
     form of Exhibit V, Exhibit VI or Exhibit VII annexed hereto, as
     the case may be, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the new
     Commitments and/or outstanding Revolving Loans and/or outstanding
     Term Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and/or the
     assigning Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
     rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply
     with this subsection 10.1B shall be treated for purposes of this
     Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
     rights and obligations in accordance with subsection 10.1C.

             (ii)  Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in Register.
     Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an
     assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an
     Eligible Assignee, together with the processing and recordation
     fee (if so required) referred to in subsection 10.1B(i) and any
     forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United
     States federal income tax withholding matters that such assignee
     may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to
     subsection 2.7B(iii)(a), Administrative Agent shall, if
     Administrative Agent (and if necessary, Borrower) has consented
     to the assignment evidenced thereby (in each case to the extent
     such consent is required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)),
     (a) accept such Assignment Agreement by executing a counterpart
     thereof as provided therein (which acceptance shall evidence any
     required consent of Administrative Agent to such assignment),
     (b) record the information contained therein in the Register, and
     (c) give prompt notice thereof to Borrower.  Administrative Agent
     shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to
     and accepted by it as provided in this subsection 10.1B(ii).

         C.    Participations.  Any Lender may, without the consent of, or
notice to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations
to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and
(iii) Borrower, Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a
Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender
shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument
may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of
such Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
that affects such Participant if such amendment, modification or
waiver requires the unanimous written consent of all Lenders
pursuant to subsection 10.6.  Subject to subsection 10.1D,
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of subsections 2.6D, 2.7, and 3.6 to the same extent as
if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to subsection 10.1B; provided, however, that in no event
shall Borrower be obligated to make any payment with respect to
such subsections which is greater than the amount that Borrower
would have paid to the Lender had no such participation been
sold.  To the extent permitted by law, if any amounts outstanding
under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been
declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default, each participant shall be deemed to have
the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in
amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the
amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as
a Lender under this Agreement.

         D.    No Greater Payments to Participants.  A Participant shall
not be entitled to receive any greater payment under subsections
2.6D, 2.7, and 3.6 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with Borrower's prior written consent.  A
Participant that would be a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender
shall not be entitled to the benefits of subsection 2.7 unless
Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of
Borrower, to comply with subsection 2.7B(iii) as though it were a
Lender.

         E.    Assignments to Secured Parties and Trustees.  In addition to
the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing
provisions of this subsection 10.1, (a) any Lender may assign and
pledge all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations
owed to such Lender, and its Notes to any creditor, including any
Federal Reserve Bank, as collateral security pursuant to
Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that (i) no Lender shall, as between Borrower and
such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a
result of any such assignment and pledge and (ii) in no event
shall such creditor be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled
to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any
action hereunder, (b) any Lender which is a Fund may pledge its
Loans and/or Notes to its trustee for the benefit of its
investors without consent by or notice to Borrower or
Administrative Agent.

         F.    Information.  Each Lender may furnish any information
concerning Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the possession of
that Lender from time to time to assignees and participants
(including prospective assignees and participants), subject to
subsection 10.19.

         G.    Representations of Lenders.  Each Lender listed on the
signature pages hereof hereby represents and warrants (i) that it
is an Eligible Assignee described in clause (A) of the definition
thereof; (ii) that it has experience and expertise in the making
of loans such as the Loans; and (iii) that it will make its Loans
for its own account in the ordinary course of its business and
without a present view to distribution of such Loans within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other
federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the
provisions of this subsection 10.1, the disposition of such Loans
or any interests therein shall at all times remain within its
exclusive control).  Each Lender that becomes a party hereto
pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree that
the representations and warranties of such Lender contained in
such Assignment Agreement are incorporated herein by this
reference.

       10.2   Expenses.

              Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consummated, Borrower agrees to pay promptly (i) all the
actual and reasonable costs and expenses of preparation of the
Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other
modifications thereto; (ii) all the costs of furnishing all
opinions by counsel for Borrower (including any opinions
requested by Lenders as to any legal matters arising hereunder)
and of Borrower's performance of and compliance with all
agreements and conditions on its part to be performed or complied
with under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents including
with respect to confirming compliance with environmental,
insurance and solvency requirements; (iii) the reasonable fees,
expenses and disbursements of counsel to Administrative Agent in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
administration of the Loan Documents and any consents,
amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and any other
documents or matters requested by Borrower; (iv) all the actual
costs and reasonable expenses of creating and perfecting Liens in
favor of Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders pursuant to
any Collateral Document, including filing and recording fees,
expenses and taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, search fees,
title insurance premiums, and reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of counsel to Administrative Agent and of counsel
providing any opinions that Administrative Agent or Requisite
Lenders may request in respect of the Collateral Documents or the
Liens created pursuant thereto; (v) all the actual costs and
reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of any auditors, accountants or appraisers and any
environmental or other consultants, advisors and agents employed
or retained by Administrative Agent or its counsel) of obtaining
and reviewing any environmental audits or reports provided for as
a result of its due diligence or 6.7C and any audits or reports
provided for under subsection 4.1M or 6.5B with respect to
Inventory and accounts receivable of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries; (vi) the custody or preservation of any of the
Collateral; (vii) all other actual and reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the
syndication of the Commitments and the negotiation, preparation
and execution of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments,
waivers or other modifications thereto and the transactions
contemplated thereby; (viii) after the occurrence of an Event of
Default, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees (including allocated costs of internal counsel) and fees,
costs and expenses of accountants, advisors and consultants,
incurred by Administrative Agent and its counsel relating to
efforts to (a) evaluate or assess any Loan Party, its business or
financial condition and (b) protect, evaluate, assess or dispose
of any of the Collateral; and (ix) all costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees (including allocated costs
of internal counsel), fees, costs and expenses of accountants,
advisors and consultants and costs of settlement, incurred by
Administrative Agent and each Lender in enforcing any Obligations
of or in collecting any payments due from any Loan Party
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by reason of such
Event of Default (including in connection with the sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral
or the enforcement of the Subsidiary Guaranty) or in connection
with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or
pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

       10.3   Indemnity.

              In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to
subsection 10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consummated, Borrower agrees to defend (subject
to Indemnitees' selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold
harmless Administrative Agent and Lenders, and the officers,
directors, employees, counsel, agents, representatives, trustees,
advisors and affiliates of Administrative Agent and Lenders
(collectively called the "Indemnitees"), from and against any and
all Indemnified Liabilities (as hereinafter defined); provided
that Borrower shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise solely from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined
by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

              As used herein, "Indemnified Liabilities" means,
collectively, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages (including natural resource damages), penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, claims (including Environmental Claims and
Releases), costs (including the costs of any investigation,
study, sampling, testing, abatement, cleanup, removal,
remediation or other response action necessary to remove,
remediate, clean up or abate any Hazardous Materials Activity),
expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for
Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative
or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened by any Person,
whether or not any such Indemnitee shall be designated as a party
or a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses incurred
by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether direct,
indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal, state
or foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations (including
securities and commercial laws, statutes, rules or regulations
and Environmental Laws), on common law or equitable cause or on
contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to
or arising out of (i) this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
or the Transactions or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including Lenders' agreement to make the Loans hereunder
or the use or intended use of the proceeds thereof or the
issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder or the use or intended
use of any thereof, or any enforcement of any of the Loan
Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the
Subsidiary Guaranty), (ii) the statements contained in the
commitment letter delivered by any Lender to Borrower or
Administrative Agent with respect thereto, and/or (iii) any
Environmental Claim or any Hazardous Materials Activity relating
to or arising from, directly or indirectly, any past or present
activity, operation, land ownership, or practice of Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries.

              To the extent that the undertakings to defend,
indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this subsection
10.3 may be unenforceable in whole or in part because they are
violative of any law or public policy, Borrower shall contribute
the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under
applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified
Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

       10.4   Set-Off; Security Interest in Deposit Accounts.

              In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender
is hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or from time to
time, without notice to Borrower or to any other Person, any such
notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits or other amounts
held by any Lender (or any Affiliate of that Lender) for the
credit or account of Borrower (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final, including Indebtedness evidenced by
certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not
including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time
held or owing by that Lender (or any Affiliate of that Lender) to
or for the credit or the account of Borrower and each other Loan
Party against and on account of the Obligations of Borrower and
each other Loan Party to that Lender (or any Affiliate of that
Lender) under this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and
participations therein and the other Loan Documents, including
all claims of any nature or description arising out of or
connected with this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and
participations therein or any other Loan Document, irrespective
of whether or not (i) that Lender shall have made any demand
hereunder or (ii) the principal of or the interest on the Loans
or any amounts in respect of the Letters of Credit or any other
amounts due hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents
shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 8 and
although said obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be
contingent or unmatured.  Borrower hereby further grants to
Administrative Agent and each Lender a security interest in all
deposits and accounts maintained with Administrative Agent or
such Lender as security for the Obligations.

       10.5   Ratable Sharing.

              Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of
them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary
prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement), by realization upon security, through the
exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right
under the Loan Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection
of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy
Code, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the
aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in
respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and
owing to that Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
(collectively, the "Aggregate Amounts Due" to such Lender) that
is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in
respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then
the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall
(i) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the
receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment
to purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have
purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon
the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the
Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such
recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all
Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them
hereunder; provided that if all or part of such proportionately
greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization
of Borrower or otherwise (and whether by litigation, demand,
settlement or otherwise), those purchases shall be rescinded and
the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be
returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.  Borrower expressly consents to
the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a
participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of
banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and
all monies owing by Borrower to that holder with respect thereto
as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the
participation held by that holder.

       10.6   Amendments and Waivers.

              No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or of the Notes or of any of the
other Loan Documents, and no consent to any departure by Borrower
herefrom or therefrom, shall in any event be effective without
the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders; unless otherwise
provided elsewhere in this Agreement; provided that in addition:

              (a)   any such amendment, modification, termination,
waiver or consent which:

              (i)   postpones the date or reduces the amount of any scheduled
     payment of principal of any of the Loans;

              (ii)  postpones the date on which any interest or any fees are
     payable or reduces the amount of any interest or any fees payable
     hereunder;

              (iii) changes in any manner the definition of "Pro Rata
     Share", the definition of "Requisite Lenders";

              (iv)  changes in any manner any provision of this Agreement
     which, by its terms, expressly requires the approval or concurrence of
     all Lenders;

              (v)   releases any Lien granted in favor of Administrative Agent
     with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral;

              (vi)  releases all or substantially all of the Subsidiary
     Guarantors from their obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty,
     in each case other than in accordance with the terms of the Loan
     Documents; or

              (vii) changes in any manner the provisions contained in
     subsection 8.1 or this subsection 10.6;

              shall be effective only if evidenced by the written
     concurrence of all Lenders.

              In addition, any release of any Lien granted in favor
of Administrative Agent with respect to a material portion of the
Collateral shall be effective only if evidenced by the written
concurrence of Lenders having or holding not less than 66 2/3% of
the sum of the aggregate Tranche A Term Loan Exposures, the
Tranche B Term Loan Exposures and the Revolving Loan Exposures of
all Lenders.

              In addition,

              (b)   no amendment, modification, termination or waiver
of any provision of any Note shall be effective without the
written concurrence of the Lender that is the holder of that
Note;

              (c)   no amendment, modification, termination or waiver
of any provision of subsection 2.1A(i)-2.1A(iii) or of any other
provision of this Agreement relating to the Term Loan Commitments
or the Revolving Loan Commitments shall increase the Commitments
of any Lender over the amount thereof then in effect without the
consent of Requisite Lenders and such Lender (it being understood
that amendments, modifications or waivers of conditions
precedent, representations and warranties, covenants or Events of
Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not
constitute an increase of the Commitment of any Lender, and that
an increase in the available portion of any Commitment of any
Lender shall not constitute an increase in the Commitment of such
Lender); and

              (d)   no amendment, modification, termination or waiver
of any provision of Section 9 or of any other provision of this
Agreement that, by its terms, expressly requires the approval or
concurrence of Administrative Agent shall be effective without
the written concurrence of Administrative Agent.

              Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation
to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments,
modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender.  Any
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given.  No
notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle
Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances.  Any amendment, modification, termination,
waiver or consent effected in accordance with this subsection
10.6 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding,
each future Lender and, if signed by Borrower, on Borrower.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, as
among Lenders and Administrative Agent in connection with the
exercise of remedies under any of Loan Documents, the written
concurrence of Requisite Lenders shall be required for
Administrative Agent to execute proxy rights in the election of
the board of directors of any Loan Party owning real property or
to acquire any ownership interest in real property of any Loan
Party.

       10.7   Independence of Covenants.

              All covenants hereunder shall be given independent
effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be
permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within the
limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence
of an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default if such
action is taken or condition exists.

       10.8   Notices; Effectiveness of Signatures.

              Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any
notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be
given shall be in writing and may be personally served, telexed
or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or courier service
and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person
or by courier service, upon receipt of telefacsimile or telex, or
three Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail
with postage prepaid and properly addressed; provided that
notices to Administrative Agent shall not be effective until
received.  For the purposes hereof, the address of each party
hereto shall be as set forth under such party's name on the
signature pages hereof or (i) as to Borrower and Administrative
Agent, such other address as shall be designated by such Person
in a written notice delivered to the other parties hereto and
(ii) as to each other party, such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice delivered to
Administrative Agent.  A courtesy copy of any notice delivered to
Borrower or any other Loan Party will be delivered to Winston &
Strawn, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166, Attention:
Benjamin M. Polk, Esq., Facsimile No. (212) 294-4700; provided,
however, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall no liability for
any failure to deliver a courtesy copy to Mr. Polk and any
failure to deliver such notice to Mr. Polk shall not affect the
validity or effectiveness of any notice delivered to Borrower or
any other Loan Party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

              Electronic mail may be used to distribute routine
communications, such as financial statements and other
information; provided, however, that no signature with respect to
any notice, request, agreement, waiver, amendment or other
document or any notice that is intended to have binding effect
may be sent by electronic mail.

              Loan Documents and notices under the Loan Documents may
be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile.  The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable
law, have the same force and effect as an original copy with
manual signatures and shall be binding on all Loan Parties,
Agents and Lenders.  Administrative Agent may also require that
any such documents and signature be confirmed by a manually-
signed copy thereof; provided, however, that the failure to
request or deliver any such manually-signed copy shall not affect
the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

       10.9  Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.

             A.    All representations, warranties and agreements made herein
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the making of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit
hereunder.

             B.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by
law to the contrary, the agreements of Borrower set forth in
subsections 2.6D, 2.7, 3.5A, 3.6, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.17, and
10.18 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in subsections
9.2C, 9.4, 10.5 and 10.18 shall survive the payment of the Loans,
the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and the
reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the
termination of this Agreement.

       10.10  Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.

              No failure or delay on the part of Administrative Agent
or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall impair such
power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any
default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or
further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or
privilege.  All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

       10.11  Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.

              Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be
under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower
or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the
Obligations.  To the extent that Borrower makes a payment or
payments to Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to Administrative
Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or Administrative Agent or
Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights
of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such
enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other
party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law,
common law or any equitable cause (whether by litigation, demand,
settlement or otherwise), then, to the extent of such recovery,
the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related
thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment or payments had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

       10.12  Severability.

              In case any provision in or obligation under this
Agreement or the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or
obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

       10.13  Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders'
              Rights.

              The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no
Lender shall be responsible for the obligations or Commitments of
any other Lender hereunder.  Nothing contained herein or in any
other Loan Document, and no action taken by Lenders pursuant
hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders, or
Lenders and Borrower, as a partnership, an association, a joint
venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any
time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent
debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce
its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be
necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional
party in any proceeding for such purpose.

       10.14  Release of Security Interest or Guaranty.

              Upon the proposed sale or other disposition of any
Collateral that is permitted by this Agreement or to which
Requisite Lenders have otherwise consented, or the sale or other
disposition of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor
to any Person (other than to a Subsidiary Guarantor) permitted by
this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise
consented, for which a Loan Party desires to obtain a security
interest release or a release of the Subsidiary Guaranty from
Administrative Agent, such Loan Party shall deliver an Officer's
Certificate (i) stating that the Collateral or the Capital Stock
subject to such disposition is being sold or otherwise disposed
of in compliance with the terms hereof and (ii) specifying the
Collateral or Capital Stock being sold or otherwise disposed of
in the proposed transaction.  Upon the receipt of such Officer's
Certificate, Administrative Agent shall, at such Loan Party's
expense, so long as Administrative Agent (a) has no reason to
believe that the facts stated in such Officer's Certificate are
not true and correct, and (b) if the sale or other disposition of
such item of Collateral or Capital Stock constitutes an Asset
Sale, shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that
arrangements satisfactory to it have been made for delivery of
the Net Asset Sale Proceeds if and as required by subsection 2.4,
execute and deliver such releases of its security interest in
such Collateral or such Subsidiary Guaranty, as may be reasonably
requested by such Loan Party.

       10.15  Applicable Law.

              THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK), WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF
LAWS PRINCIPLES.

       10.16  Successors and Assigns.

              The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by Borrower
without such consent shall be null and void).  Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby, Affiliates of Administrative Agent
and Affiliates of Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

       10.17  Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process.

              ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST BORROWER
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT, OR ANY OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY
STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE,
COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK.  BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS
AGREEMENT, BORROWER, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY

              (I)   ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE
     NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS;

              (II)  WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS;

              (III) AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY
     SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED
     OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO BORROWER AT
     ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSECTION 10.8;

              (IV)  AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (III)
     ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER
     BORROWER IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND
     OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY
     RESPECT;

              (V)   AGREES THAT LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE
     PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING
     PROCEEDINGS AGAINST BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER
     JURISDICTION; AND

              (VI)  AGREES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION
     10.17 RELATING TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE SHALL BE BINDING
     AND ENFORCEABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER NEW
     YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW SECTION 5-1402 OR OTHERWISE.

       10.18  Waiver of Jury Trial.

              EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES TO
WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE
OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE
LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED.  The
scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of all
disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the
subject matter of this transaction, including contract claims,
tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law and
statutory claims.  Each party hereto acknowledges that this
waiver is a material inducement to enter into a business
relationship, that each has already relied on this waiver in
entering into this Agreement, and that each will continue to rely
on this waiver in their related future dealings.  Each party
hereto further warrants and represents that it has reviewed this
waiver with its legal counsel and that it knowingly and
voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following consultation
with legal counsel.  THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT
MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A
MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION
10.18 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS
WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS
RELATING TO THE LOANS MADE HEREUNDER.  In the event of
litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a
trial by the court.

       10.19  Confidentiality.

              Each Lender shall hold all non-public information
obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement that has
been identified in writing as confidential by Borrower or in any
environmental assessment, investigation, analyses or reports
obtained pursuant to subsection 6.7C in accordance with such
Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential
information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound
banking practices, it being understood and agreed by Borrower
that in any event a Lender may make disclosures (a) to its and
its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will
be informed of the confidential nature of such information and
instructed to keep such information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any Governmental Authority, (c) to the extent
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement,
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or
any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this
subsection 10.19, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or participant
in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any
direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective
counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective
counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative
transaction relating to obligations of Borrower, (g) with the
consent of Borrower, (h) to the extent such information
(i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach
of this subsection 10.19, or (ii) becomes available to
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than Borrower, or (i) to the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar
organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that
requires access to information about a Lender's or its
Affiliates' investment portfolio in connection with ratings
issued with respect to such Lender or its Affiliates and that no
written or oral communications from counsel to an Agent and no
information that is or is designated as privileged or as attorney
work product may be disclosed to any Person unless such Person is
a Lender or a participant hereunder; provided that, unless
specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each
Lender shall notify Borrower of any request by any Governmental
Authority or representative thereof (other than any such request
in connection with any examination of the financial condition of
such Lender by such Governmental Authority) for disclosure of any
such non-public information prior to disclosure of such
information; and provided, further, that in no event shall any
Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished
by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Borrower understands and agrees
that Administrative Agent and each of the institutions identified
as "Lead Arranger" on the title page to this Agreement may make
customary disclosures for advertising and "league table"
purposes.

       10.20  Lead Arranger

              The institution identified as Lead Arranger on the
title page to this Agreement shall not have any obligations,
liabilities or duties under this Agreement other than those
applicable to a Lender (but only if such institution is a Lender)
as such, and no such institution shall have or be deemed to have
any fiduciary relationship with any Lender.  Each Lender
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any
such institution in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in
taking or not taking any action hereunder.

       10.21  Counterparts; Effectiveness.

              This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or
supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument;
signature pages may be detached from multiple separate
counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all
signature pages are physically attached to the same document.
This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a
counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto and receipt by
Borrower and Administrative Agent of written or telephonic
notification of such execution and authorization of delivery
thereof.

          [Remainder of page intentionally left blank]

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first written
above.
