                            PLATINUM RE (UK) LIMITED

                               (RETROCESSIONA1RE)

      contracts (each, a "Reinsurance Contract") that are new or renewal
      traditional reinsurance contracts entered into by Retrocedant on or after
      the Effective Date pursuant to Clause 4.1 or Clause 4.3 of Part B of the

<PAGE>

TERM

      This Agreement shall be continuous as to the Reinsurance Contracts. Except
      as mutually agreed in writing by Retrocedant and Retrocessionaire, this
      Agreement shall remain continuously in force until all Reinsurance
      Contracts are terminated, expired, cancelled or commuted.

      Reinsurance Contracts, one hundred percent (100%) of all gross premiums
      written on or after the Effective Time, net of premium returns, allowances
      and cancellations and less any applicable Retrocedant Ceding Commission
      and Inuring Retrocession premiums.

RETROCEDANT CEDING COMMISSION

      With respect to the Reinsurance Contracts, Retrocessionaire shall pay to
      Retrocedant a ceding commission (the "RETROCEDANT CEDING COMMISSION"), and
      such Retrocedant Ceding Commission shall equal 100 percent (100%) of the
      actual expenses incurred in writing each Reinsurance Contract, including
      actual ceding commissions and brokerage fees, as determined in accordance
      with Retrocedant's customary practices and procedures and as submitted to
      The St. Paul Companies, Inc., all as allocable pro rata to periods from
      and after the Effective Time. Retrocedant Ceding Commission shall also
      include all underwriting fees and other costs and expenses paid by
      Retrocedant pursuant to the Agency Agreement between Retrocedant and
      Retrocessionaire, and all underwriting and other expenses incurred by
      Retrocedant on or after the Effective Time with respect to the liabilities

      same modifications and alterations, as the respective Reinsurance

INURING RETROCESSIONS

ALLOCATION TO RETROCESSIONAIRE

      Retrocedant agrees that the retrocession contracts purchased by the
      reinsurance division of The St. Paul ("ST. PAUL RE") from third party
      retrocessionaires ("THIRD PARTY RETROCESSIONAIRES") on behalf of
      Retrocedant prior to the Effective Time that are listed on Exhibit A
      hereto shall inure to the benefit of Retrocessionaire to the extent of
      liabilities covered under this Agreement ("Inuring Retrocessions"),
      subject to the agreed allocations in Exhibits B, C and D. It is further
      understood and agreed that facultative and other reinsurances not listed
      on Exhibit A but relating to the Reinsurance Contracts shall also inure to
      the benefit of Retrocessionaire to the extent of liabilities covered under
      this Agreement and shall be considered Inuring Retrocessions under this
      Agreement.

INURING RETROCESSIONS CLAIMS

      Each of the parties agrees to transfer to the other party all recoveries
      or any portion thereof that such party receives on or after the Effective
      Time pursuant to the Inuring Retrocessions which are allocated to the
      other party in the manner set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Retrocedant shall
      use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect any recoveries due to
      Retrocessionaire under the Inuring Retrocessions that indemnify the
      Retrocedant for losses or expenses payable or return of premium allocable
      to the Retrocessionaire and shall hold them on trust for, and pay them to
      or to the order of Retrocessionaire. The parties agree that
      Retrocessionaire's obligations to make payments pursuant to the Inuring
      Retrocessions or to reimburse Retrocedant pursuant to this Agreement shall
      not be waived by non-receipt of any such amounts. Retrocessionaire shall
      reimburse Retrocedant for one hundred percent (100%) of any expenses
      reasonably incurred by Retrocedant in attempting to make such collection,
      including all allocated expenses, as determined in accordance with St.
      Paul Re's customary practices and procedures. Retrocessionaire shall have
      the right to associate with Retrocedant, at Retrocessionaire's own
      expense, in any actions brought by Retrocedant to make such collections.

      In the event claims of Retrocedant and Retrocessionaire aggregate in
      excess of the applicable limit under an Inuring Retrocession, all limits
      applicable to either Retrocedant or Retrocessionaire shall be allocated
      between Retrocedant and Retrocessionaire in the manner set forth in
      Exhibit D hereto.

CONSIDERATION

      Retrocessionaire agrees to pay under the Inuring Retrocessions its share
      of all future premiums Retrocedant is obligated to pay pursuant to the
      terms of the Inuring Retrocessions to the extent that such premiums are
      allocable to Retrocessionaire in the manner set forth in Exhibit C hereto,
      and not otherwise paid by Retrocessionaire and to indemnify Retrocedant
      for all such premiums paid directly by Retrocedant, net of any ceding
      commissions and similar amounts paid by Third Party Retrocessionaires to
      Retrocedant.

TERMINATION OR COMMUTATION OF INURING RETROCESSIONS

      With respect to any Inuring Retrocessions providing coverage solely with
      respect to the Reinsurance Contracts, Retrocedant agrees, on behalf of
      itself and its affiliates, that Retrocedant shall not take any action or
      fail to take any action that would reasonably result in the termination or
      commutation of, or any material change in the coverage provided by, any
      Inuring Retrocession, without the prior written consent of the
      Retrocessionaire, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

      With respect to any Inuring Retrocessions providing coverage for both
      Reinsurance Contracts and to business not being transferred, neither party
      shall take any action or fail to take any action that would reasonably
      result in the termination or commutation of, or any material change in the
      coverage provided by, any Inuring Retrocession, without the prior written
      consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE; SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION; FOLLOW THE FORTUNES

      Retrocessionaire shall be liable for one hundred percent (100%) of all
      future loss, loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported losses
      and other payment obligations as incurred by Retrocedant under the
      Reinsurance Contracts on and after the Effective Date. Retrocessionaire
      shall have the right to all salvage and subrogation on the account of
      claims and settlements with respect to the Reinsurance Contracts.


                                       3

<PAGE>
      In the event of a claim under a Reinsurance Contract, Retrocedant will
      assess the validity of the claim and make a determination as to payment,
      consistent with the claims handling guidelines previously provided to
      Retrocedant in writing by Retrocessionaire and Retrocessionaire may
      exercise its rights under the Administration subsection in respect
      thereof. Retrocedant shall provide prompt notice of any claim in excess of
      USD500,000 or GBP325,000 to Retrocessionaire. All payments made by
      Retrocedant, whether under strict contract terms or by way of compromise,
      shall be binding on Retrocessionaire. In addition, if Retrocedant refuses
      to pay a claim in full and a legal proceeding results, Retrocessionaire
      will be unconditionally bound by any settlement agreed to by Retrocedant
      or the adverse judgment of any court or arbitrator (which could include
      any judgment for bad faith, punitive damages, excess policy limit losses
      or extra contractual obligations) and Retrocedant may recover with respect
      to such settlements and judgments under this Agreement. Though Retrocedant
      will settle such claims and litigation in good faith, Retrocessionaire is
      bound to accept the settlements paid by Retrocedant and such settlements
      may be for amounts that could be greater than the amounts that would be
      agreed to by Retrocessionaire if Retrocessionaire were to settle such
      claims or litigation directly. It is the intent of this Agreement that
      Retrocessionaire shall in every case in which this Agreement applies and
      in the proportion specified herein "follow the fortunes" of Retrocedant in
      respect of risks Retrocessionarire has accepted under this Agreement.

EXTRA CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

      In the event Retrocedant or Retrocessionaire is held liable to pay any
      punitive, exemplary, compensatory or consequential damages because of
      alleged or actual bad faith or negligence related to the handling of any
      claim under any Reinsurance Contract or otherwise in respect of such
      Reinsurance Contract, the parties shall be liable for such damages in
      proportion to their responsibility for the conduct giving rise to the
      damages. Such determination shall be made by Retrocedant and
      Retrocessionaire, acting jointly and in good faith, and in the event the
      parties are unable to reach agreement as to such determination, recourse
      shall be had to the Arbitration Section hereof.

ADMINISTRATION OF REINSURANCE CONTRACTS

ADMINISTRATION

      The parties agree that, as of the Effective Time, Retrocedant shall have
      the sole authority to administer the Reinsurance Contracts in all
      respects, which authority shall include, but not be limited to, authority
      to bill for and collect premiums, adjust all claims and handle all
      disputes thereunder and to effect any and all amendments, commutations and
      cancellations of the Reinsurance Contracts, subject, however, in the case
      of administration of claims, to all claims handling guidelines provided in
      advance in writing by Retrocessionaire to Retrocedant. Retrocedant shall
      not, on its own, settle any claim, waive any right, defence, setoff or
      counterclaim relating to the Reinsurance Contracts with respect to amounts
      in excess of USD500,000 or GBP325,000 or make any ex gratia payments, and
      shall not amend, commute or terminate any of the Reinsurance Contracts, in
      each case without the prior written consent of Retrocessionaire.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by law,
      Retrocessionaire may, at its discretion and at its own expense, assume the
      administration, defence and settlement of any claim upon prior written
      notice to Retrocedant. Upon receipt of such notice, Retrocedant shall not
      compromise, discharge or settle such claim except with the prior written
      consent of Retrocessionaire. Retrocessionaire shall not take any action in
      the administration of such claim that would reasonably be expected to
      adversely affect Retrocedant, its business or its reputation, without the
      prior written


                                        4

<PAGE>

      consent of Retrocedant. Subject to the terms of the Extra Contractual
      Obligations Section hereof, Retrocessionaire shall indemnify Retrocedant
      for all Losses, including punitive, exemplary, compensatory or
      consequential damages arising from such assumption of the conduct of such
      settlement pursuant to the Indemnification Section herein.

REPORTING AND REGULATORY MATTERS

      Each party shall provide the notices and filings required to be made by it
      to relevant regulatory authorities as a result of this Agreement.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall provide to the other party
      any information in its possession regarding the Reinsurance Contracts as
      reasonably required by the other party to make such filings and in a form
      as agreed to by the parties.

DUTY TO COOPERATE

      Upon the terms and subject to the conditions and other agreements set
      forth herein, each party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
      to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
      done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all
      things necessary or advisable to perform the transactions contemplated by
      this Agreement.

COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO THE REINSURANCE CONTRACTS

      Following the Effective Time, Retrocedant and Retrocessionaire shall each
      promptly forward to the other copies of all material notices and other
      written communications it receives relating to the Reinsurance Contracts
      (including, without limitation, all inquiries and complaints from relevant
      insurance regulators, brokers and other service providers and reinsureds
      and all notices of claims, suits and actions for which it receives service
      of process.)

REPORTS AND REMITTANCES

REPORT FROM RETROCEDANT

      Within 30 days after the close of each month, Retrocedant shall provide
      Retrocessionaire with a summary statement of account for the previous
      month showing all activity relating to each of the Reinsurance Contracts,
      including related administration costs and expenses incurred by
      Retrocedant, consisting of the categories of information set forth in
      Exhibit E hereto. The monthly statement of account shall also provide a
      breakdown of any amounts due to Retrocedant or Retrocessionaire, as the
      case may be, as reimbursement for paid claims, collected premiums or other
      amounts due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including amounts
      relating to Inuring Retrocessions.

REMITTANCES

      Within ten Business Days after delivery of each monthly report pursuant to
      the Report subsection of this Section, Retrocedant and Retrocessionaire
      shall settle all amounts then due under this Agreement for that month.

LATE PAYMENTS

      Should any payment due any party to this Agreement be received by such
      party after the due date for such payment under this Agreement, interest
      shall accrue from the date on which such payment was due until payment is
      received by the party entitled thereto, at an annual rate equal to the
      London Interbank Offered Rate quoted for six month periods as reported in
      The Wall Street Journal on the first Business Day of the


                                       5

<PAGE>

      month in which such payment first becomes due plus one hundred basis
      points (the "Applicable Rate").

COST REIMBURSEMENT

      Retrocessionaire shall reimburse for its allocated share of all costs and
      expenses incurred by Retrocedant in administering the Reinsurance
      Contracts as set forth in Exhibit F hereto.

CURRENCY

      For purposes of this Agreement, where Retrocedant receives premiums or
      pays losses in currencies other than United States dollars, GBP or Euros,
      such premiums or losses shall be converted into GBP at the actual rates of
      exchange at which these premiums or losses are entered in the
      Retrocedant's books.

MAINTENANCE OF LICENSES

      Each of Retrocedant and Retrocessionaire hereby covenants to maintain at
      all times all licences and authorisations required to undertake the
      actions contemplated hereby.

ACCESS TO RECORDS

      From and after the Effective Date, Retrocedant shall afford to
      Retrocessionaire and its respective authorized accountants, counsel and
      other designated representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES")
      reasonable access (including using commercially reasonable best efforts to
      give access to Persons possessing information) during normal business
      hours to all data and information that is specifically described in
      writing (collectively, "INFORMATION") within the possession of Retrocedant
      relating to the liabilities transferred hereunder, insofar as such
      information is reasonably required by Retrocessionaire. Similarly, from
      and after the Effective Date, Retrocessionaire shall afford to
      Retrocedant, any Post-closing Subsidiary of Retrocedant and their
      respective Representatives reasonable access (including using commercially
      reasonable best efforts to give access to Persons possessing information)
      during normal business hours to Information within Retrocessionaire's
      possession relating to Retrocedant, insofar as such information is
      reasonably required by Retrocedant. Information may be requested under
      this Section for, without limitation, audit, accounting, claims,
      litigation (other than any claims or litigation between the parties
      hereto) and tax purposes, as well as for purposes of fulfilling disclosure
      and reporting obligations and for performing this Agreement and the
      transactions contemplated hereby.

      From and after the Effective Date, Retrocessionaire and Retrocedant or
      their designated representatives may inspect, at the place where such
      records are located, any and all data and information that is specifically
      described in writing within the possession of the other party hereto
      reasonably relating to this Agreement, on reasonable prior notice and
      during normal business hours. The rights of the parties under this Section
      shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall continue for as long
      as there may be liabilities under the Reinsurance Contracts or reporting
      or retention requirements under applicable law. In addition, each party
      shall have the right to take copies (including electronic copies) of any
      information held by the other party that reasonably relates to this
      Agreement or the Reinsurance Contracts. Each party shall, and shall cause
      its designated representatives to, treat and hold as confidential
      information any information it receives or obtains pursuant to this
      Section.

INDEMNIFICATION

INDEMNIFICATION BY RETROCEDANT

      Retrocedant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
      Retrocessionaire, and its officers, directors and employees with respect
      to any and all Losses arising from any breach by Retrocedant of any
      representation, warranty or covenant herein. Retrocedant further agrees to
      indemnify, defend and hold harmless Retrocessionaire and its officers,
      directors and employees against any and all Losses arising out of
      Retrocedant's administration of the Reinsurance Contracts, including but
      not limited to extracontractual obligations, payments in excess of policy
      limits and settlements made in respect of any such claims to the extent
      arising from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Retrocedant
      except to the extent such actions are taken with the prior consent or
      direction of Retrocessionaire. Such indemnification obligations shall be
      limited to the aggregate of all fees paid to Retrocedant pursuant to the
      Cost Reimbursement subsection hereof.

 INDEMNIFICATION BY RETROCESSIONAIRE

      Retrocessionaire agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
      Retrocedant, and its officers, directors and employees with respect to any
      and all Losses arising from any breach by Retrocessionaire of any
      representation, warranty or covenant herein. Retrocessionaire further
      agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Retrocedant and its
      officers, directors and employees against any and all Losses arising out
      of Retrocessionaire's administration of the Reinsurance Contracts,
      including but not limited to extracontractual obligations, payments in
      excess of policy limits and settlements made in respect of any such
      claims.

INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES

      (a)   If a party seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section (each,
            an "INDEMNITEE") receives notice or otherwise learns of the
            assertion by a Person (including, without limitation, any
            governmental entity) who is not a party to this Agreement or an
            Affiliate thereof, of any claim or of the commencement by any such
            Person of any Action (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM") with respect to which
            the party from whom indemnification is sought (each, an
            "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") may be obligated to provide indemnification
            pursuant to the Indemnification by Retrocedant and the
            indemnification by Retrocessionaire subsections of this Section,
            such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice
            thereof promptly after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim;
            provided that the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as
            provided in this Section shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
            its obligations under this Section, except to the extent that such
            Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice.
            Such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in as much detail
            as is reasonably possible and, if ascertainable, shall indicate the
            amount (estimated if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be
            sustained by such Indemnitee.

      (b)   An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend or to seek to settle or
            compromise, at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such
            Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any Third Party Claim. Within 30
            days of the receipt of notice from an indemnitee in accordance with
            subsection (a) of this Section (or sooner, if the nature of such
            Third Party Claim so requires), the indemnifying Party shall notify
            the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will
            assume responsibility for defending such Third Party Claim, which
            election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice
            from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to
            assume the defence of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party
            shall not be


                                        7

<PAGE>

            liable to such Indemnitee under this Section for any legal or other
            expenses (except expenses approved in writing in advance by the
            Indemnifying Party) subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in
            connection with the defence thereof; provided that, if the
            defendants in any such claim include both the Indemnifying Party and
            one or more Indemnitees and in any Indemnitee's reasonable judgment
            a conflict of interest between one or more of such Indemnitees and
            such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim or if the
            Indemnifying Party shall have assumed responsibility for such claim
            with reservations or exceptions that would materially prejudice such
            Indemnitees, such Indemnitees shall have the right to employ
            separate counsel to represent such Indemnitees and in that event the
            reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but not more
            than one separate counsel for all such Indemnitees reasonably
            satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) shall be paid by such
            Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
            responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify
            an Indemnitee of its election as provided in this Section, such
            Indemnitee may defend or (subject to the remainder of this Section)
            seek to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim at the expense
            of the Indemnifying Party.

      (c)   Neither an Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee shall consent to
            entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third
            Party Claim which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
            the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee, in the
            case of a consent or settlement by an Indemnifying Party, or the
            Indemnifying Party, in the case of a consent or settlement by the
            Indemnitee, of a written release from all liability in respect to
            such Third Party Claim.

      (d)   If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise
            or settle any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall make available
            at reasonable times to such Indemnifying Party any personnel or any
            books, records or other documents within its control or which it
            otherwise has the ability to make available that are necessary or
            appropriate for such defence, settlement or compromise, and shall
            otherwise cooperate in a reasonable manner in the defence,
            settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim.

      (e)   Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, neither an
            Indemnifying Party nor an indemnitee may settle or compromise any
            claim over the objection of the other; provided that consent to
            settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld or
            delayed. If an Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnitee in writing
            of such Indemnifying Party's desire to settle or compromise a Third
            Party Claim on the basis set forth in such notice (provided that
            such settlement or compromise includes as an unconditional term
            thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff of a written release
            of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect thereof) and the
            Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing that such
            Indemnitee declines to accept any such settlement or compromise,
            such Indemnitee may continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free
            of any participation by such Indemnifying Party, at such
            Indemnitee's sole expense. In such event, the obligation of such
            Indemnifying Party to such Indemnitee with respect to such Third
            Party Claim shall be equal to (i) the costs and expenses of such
            Indemnitee prior to the date such Indemnifying Party notifies such
            Indemnitee of the offer to settle or compromise (to the extent such
            costs and expenses are otherwise indemnifiable hereunder) plus (ii)
            the lesser of (A) the amount of any offer of settlement or
            compromise which such Indemnitee declined to accept and (B) the
            actual out-of-pocket amount such indemnitee is obligated to pay
            subsequent to such date as a result of such Indemnitee's continuing
            to pursue such Third Party Claim.

      (f)   In the event of payment by an Indemnifying Party to any indemnitee
            in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party
            shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such
            Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which
            such Indemnitee may have any right or claim relating to such Third
            Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third
            Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall
            cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and
            at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting
            any subrogated right or claim.

      (g)   Except with respect to claims relating to actual fraud, the
            indemnification provisions set forth in this Section are the sole
            and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto for any and all claims
            for indemnification under this Agreement.

SURVIVAL

      This Indemnification Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.

ARBITRATION

      All disputes and differences arising under or in connection with this
      Agreement shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of
      the A.I.D.A. Reinsurance and Insurance Arbitration Society of the UK
      ("ARIAS (UK)").

      The Arbitration Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one to be
      appointed by the claimant party, one to be appointed by the respondent
      party and the third to be appointed by the two appointed arbitrators.

      The third member of the Tribunal shall be appointed as soon as practicable
      (and no later than 28 days) after the appointment of the two
      party-appointed arbitrators. The Tribunal shall be constituted upon the
      appointment of the third arbitrator.

      The Arbitrators shall be persons (including those who have retired) with
      not less than ten years' experience of insurance or reinsurance within the
      industry or as lawyers or other professional advisers serving the
      industry.

      Where a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 14 days of being
      called upon to do so or where the two party-appointed arbitrators fail to
      appoint a third within 28 days of their appointment, then upon application
      ARIAS (UK) will appoint an arbitrator to fill the vacancy. At any time
      prior to appointment by ARIAS (UK) the party or arbitrators in default may
      make such appointment.

      The Tribunal may in its sole discretion make such orders and directions as
      it considers to be necessary for the final determination of the matters in
      dispute. The Tribunal shall have the widest discretion permitted under the
      law governing the arbitral procedure when making such orders or
      directions.

      The seat of arbitration shall be London.

      Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and shall share
      equally with the other party the expense of the third arbitrator and of
      the arbitration.

      This Arbitration Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.

INSOLVENCY

      In the event of the insolvency of Retrocedant, this reinsurance shall be
      payable directly to Retrocedant, or to its liquidator, receiver,
      conservator or statutory


                                        9

<PAGE>

      successor on the basis of the liability of Retrocedant without diminution
      because of the insolvency of Retrocedant or because the liquidator,
      receiver, conservator or statutory successor of Retrocedant has failed to
      pay all or a portion of any claim.

      It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or
      statutory successor of Retrocedant shall give written notice to the
      Retrocessionaire of the pendency of a claim against Retrocedant indicating
      the Reinsurance Contract, which claim would involve a possible liability
      on the part of Retrocessionaire within a reasonable time after such claim
      is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the
      receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, Retrocessionaire
      may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the
      proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated any defence or defences
      that it may deem available to Retrocedant or its liquidator, receiver,
      conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by
      Retrocessionaire shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the
      court, against Retrocedant as part of the expense of conservation or
      liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the benefit which may
      accrue to Retrocedant solely as a result of the defence undertaken by
      Retrocessionaire.

      As to all reinsurance made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming effective
      under this Agreement, the reinsurance shall be payable as set forth above
      by Retrocessionaire to Retrocedant or to its liquidator, receiver,
      conservator or statutory successor, except (i) where the Reinsurance
      Contracts specifically provide another payee in the event of the
      insolvency of Retrocedant, and (ii) where Retrocessionaire, with the
      consent of the reinsured or reinsureds under the Reinsurance Contracts,
      has assumed such Reinsurance Contract obligations of Retrocedant as direct
      obligations of Retrocessionaire to the payees under such Reinsurance
      Contracts and in substitution for the obligations of the Retrocedant to
      such payees.

      For the purposes of this Section, "insolvency of Retrocedant" shall occur
      if:

      (i)   a winding up petition is presented in respect of Retrocedant or a
            provisional liquidator is appointed over it or if Retrocedant goes
            into administration, administrative receivership or receivership or
            if Retrocedant has a scheme of arrangement or voluntary arrangement
            proposed in relation to all or any part of its affairs; or

      (ii)  Retrocedant goes into compulsory or voluntary liquidation; or

      (iii) Retrocedant becomes subject to any other similar insolvency process
            (whether under the laws of England and Wales or elsewhere); and

      Retrocedant is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due within
      the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (or any statutory
      amendment or reenactment of that section).

OFFSET

      Retrocedant and Retrocessionaire shall have the right to offset any
      balance or amounts due from one party to the other under the terms of this
      Agreement. The party asserting the right of offset may exercise such right
      at any time whether the balances due are on account of premiums, losses or
      otherwise.

ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

      Any inadvertent delay, omission, error or failure shall not relieve either
      party hereto from any liability which would attach hereunder if such
      delay, omission, error or failure had not been made, provided such delay,
      omission, error or failure is rectified as soon as reasonably practicable
      upon discovery.

SECURITY

      As a condition precedent to this Agreement becoming effective,
      Retrocessionaire shall execute:

      (i)   the custodian and investment accounting agreement with State Street
            Bank and Trust Company ("CUSTODIAN") in the form attached as Exhibit
            G hereto (the "CUSTODY AGREEMENT");

      (ii)  the control agreement between Retrocedant, Retrocessionaire and
            Custodian in the form attached as Exhibit H hereto (the "CONTROL
            AGREEMENT");

      (iii) the discretionary investment advisory agreement with Alliance
            Capital Management L.P. ("INVESTMENT MANAGER") in the form attached
            as Exhibit I hereto (the "INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT"); and

      (iv)  the security agreement, pursuant to which Retrocessionaire grants a
            continuing first priority security interest in collateral accounts
            established with Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreement, in
            the form attached as Exhibit J hereto (the "SECURITY AGREEMENT"):

      Retrocessionaire undertakes to notify Retrocedant in writing immediately
      upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Relevant Event under the
      Security Agreement.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

SEVERABILITY

      If any term or provision of this Agreement shall be held void, illegal, or
      unenforceable, the validity of the remaining portions or provisions shall
      not be affected thereby.

SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

      This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior
      written consent of the other. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
      binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
      hereto and their respective successors and assigns as permitted herein.

EQUITABLE RELIEF

      Each party hereto acknowledges that if it or its employees or agents
      violate the terms of this Agreement, the other party will not have an
      adequate remedy at law. In the event of such a violation, the other party
      shall have the right, in addition to any other rights that may be
      available to it, to obtain in any court of competent jurisdiction
      injunctive relief to restrain any such violation and to compel specific
      performance of the provisions of this Agreement. The seeking or obtaining
      of such injunctive relief shall not foreclose or limit in any way relief
      against either party hereto for any monetary damage arising out of such
      violation.

EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS

      This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in any number of
      counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate counterparts,
      each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be

                            Allocation of Recoveries

1.    Recoveries allocable to this contract available under an Inuring
      Retrocession shall be allocated between the parties in proportion to the
      losses otherwise recoverable.

2.    Any and all loss recoveries and premium adjustments allocable to this
      contract resulting from triggering the 2002 Holborn cover will be
      allocated between The St. Paul Companies and Retrocessionaire and its
      affiliates ("Platinum Re") based on variance from plan and in accordance
      with the existing methodology shown below.

      Variance from plan at an underwriting year level will be the basis for the
      allocation. The 2000, 2001 and 2002 underwriting year plan loss ratios
      associated with the 2002 calendar year plan loss ratio will be compared to
      indicated ultimate loss ratios for the same underwriting years. These
      indicated ultimate loss ratios are the same ones used to determine if the
      Holborn cover has been triggered. The 2002 underwriting year must be
      segmented into three pieces. Namely, that business written on Fire and
      Marine paper and subject to transfer, that written on Fire and Marine
      paper and not subject to transfer and that written on Platinum Re paper.
      The distinction is warranted as the cession to Platinum Re will be net of
      the Holborn cover. The variance in loss ratio by underwriting year will be
      multiplied by the respective underwriting year's EP component in the 2002
      calendar year. This is the same EP by underwriting year that was used to
      calculate the total 2002 Holborn Year's EP. This dollar variance will be
      the basis for determining the distribution to be applied to the total loss
      recovery and AP. It is in this manner that the total loss recovery and AP
      attributable to the 2002 Holborn Year will be allocated to underwriting
      year. To the extent that the recoveries and AP's have been allocated to
      the 2000 and 2001 underwriting years they will be afforded to The St. Paul
      Companies. Similarly, the allocation to that part of the 2002 underwriting
      year pertaining to non-transferred business will also be realised by The
      St. Paul Companies. The allocation pertaining to business written on The
      St. Paul paper and transferred will be used in determining the net
      transferred business that will be ceded to Platinum Re. The remaining
      allocation associated with 2002 underwriting year business written on
      Platinum Re paper will inure to the benefit of Platinum Re directly. The
      margin for the 2002 Holborn cover will be distributed based on earned
      premium and allocated between The St. Paul Companies and Platinum Re by
      underwriting year.

                      Allocation of Retrocessional Premium

1.    Ceded premium allocable to this contract will be allocated between the
      parties and to the underwriting year in proportion to the earned subject
      premium. Ceding commission will be allocated in the same manner.

2.    Reinstatement premium allocable to this contract due in respect of
      non-proportional Inuring Retrocessions will be allocated between the
      parties in proportion to the related allocated recoverable losses.

3.    Any and all loss recoveries and premium adjustments allocable to this
      contract resulting from triggering the 2002 Holborn cover will be
      allocated between The St. Paul Companies and Platinum Re based on variance
      from plan and in accordance with the existing methodology shown below.

      Variance from plan at an underwriting year level will be the basis for the
      allocation. The 2000, 2001 and 2002 underwriting year plan loss ratios
      assciated with the 2002 calendar year plan loss ratio will be compared to
      indicated ultimate loss ratios for the same underwriting years. These
      indicated ultimate loss ratios are the same ones used to determine if the
      Holborn cover has been triggered. The 2002 underwriting year must be

                     Allocation of Administrative Expenses

Retrocessionaire shall pay to Retrocedant the "actual cost" to Retrocedant
(which shall consist of retrocedant's direct and reasonable indirect costs), as

Retrocedant shall provide Retrocessionaire with a report setting forth an
itemised list of the services provided to Retrocessionaire during such last
calendar quarter, in a form agreed to by the parties. Retrocessionaire shall
promptly (and in no event later than 30 days after receipt of such report,
unless Retrocessionaire is contesting the amount set forth in the report in good
faith) pay to Retrocedant by wire transfer of immediately available funds all
amounts payable as set forth in such report. Each party will pay all taxes for
which it is the primary obligor as a result of the provision of any service
under this Agreement; provided, that Retrocessionaire shall be solely
responsible for, and shall reimburse Retrocedant in respect of, any sales, gross
receipts, value added or transfer tax payable with respect to the provision of
any service under this Agreement, and any such reimbursement obligation shall be
in addition to Retrocessionaire's obligation to pay for such service.

behalf of the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be in "street

deem necessary or desirable. Such funds shall be deposited by State Street in
its capacity as custodian and shall be withdrawable by State Street only in that
capacity.

      Section 2.5 Collection Of Income. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.3, State Street shall collect on a timely basis all income and other payments
with respect to registered domestic securities held hereunder to which the
Company shall be entitled either by law or pursuant to custom in the securities
business, and shall collect on a timely basis all income and other payments with
respect to bearer domestic securities if, on the date of payment by the issuer,
such securities are held by State Street or its agent, and shall credit such
income, as collected, to the Account. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, State Street shall detach and present for payment all coupons and
other income items requiring presentation as and when they become due and shall
collect interest when due on securities held hereunder. Income due on securities
loaned pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(10) shall be the responsibility
of the Company. State Street will have no duty or responsibility in connection
therewith, other than to provide the Company with such information or data as

SECTION 10. COMPENSATION OF STATE STREET.

State Street shall be entitled to compensation for its services and expenses in
accordance with Schedule A hereto for the term of this Agreement.

                                       14

upon any notice, request, consent, certificate or other instrument reasonably
believed by it to be genuine and to be signed by the proper party or parties,
including any futures commission merchant acting pursuant to the terms of a
three-party futures or options agreement. State Street shall be held to the
exercise of reasonable care in carrying out the provisions of this Agreement,

counsel for the Company) on all matters, and shall be without liability for any
action reasonably taken or omitted pursuant to such advice. State Street shall
be without liability to the Company for any loss, liability, claim or expense

(including any Foreign Securities System operating in the country), prevailing
or developing custody and settlement practices, and laws and regu1ations,
app1icab1e to the safekeeping and recovery of foreign assets held in custody in
that country.

Except as may arise from State Street's own negligence or willful misconduct or
the negligence or willful misconduct of a sub-custodian or agent, State Street
shall be without liability to the Company for any loss, liability, claim or
expense resulting from or caused by: (a) events or circumstances beyond the
reasonable control of State Street or any sub-custodian or Securities System or
any agent or nominee of any of the foregoing including, without limitation, the
interruption, suspension or restriction of trading on or the closure of any
securities market, power or other mechanical or technological failures or
interruptions, computer viruses or communications disruptions, work stoppages,
natural disasters, or other similar events or acts; (b) errors by the Company or
its duly-authorized investment manager or investment advisor in their
instructions to State Street provided such instructions have been given in
accordance with this Agreement; (c) the insolvency of or acts or omissions by a
Securities System; (d) any delay or failure of any broker, agent or
intermediary, central bank or other commercially prevalent payment or clearing
system to deliver to State Street's sub-custodian or agent securities purchased
or in the remittance or payment made in connection with securities sold; (e) any
delay or failure of any company, corporation, or other body in charge of
registering or transferring securities in the name of State Street, the Company,
State Street's sub-custodians, nominees or agents or any consequential losses
arising out of such delay or failure to transfer such securities including
non-receipt of bonus, dividends and rights and other accretions or benefits; (f)
delays or inability to perform its duties due to any disorder in market
infrastructure with respect to any particular security or Securities System; and
(g) any provision of any present or future law or regu1ation or order of the
United States of America, or any state thereof, or any other country, or
political subdivision thereofor of any court of competent jurisdiction.

State Street shall be liable for the acts or omissions of a Foreign
Sub-custodian hereunder to the same extent as set forth with respect to
sub-custodians generally in this Agreement.

If the Company requires State Street to take any action with respect to
securities, which action involves the payment of money or which action may, in
the opinion of State Street, result in State Street or its nominee assigned to
the Company being liable for the payment of money or


                                       15
<PAGE>

incurring liability of some other form, the Company, as a prerequisite to
requiring State Street to take such action, shall provide indemnity to State
Street in an amount and form satisfactory to it.

If the Company requires State Street, its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents, to
advance cash or securities for any purpose (including, but not limited to,
securities settlements, foreign exchange contracts and assumed settlement) or in
the event that State Street or its nominee shall incur or be assessed any taxes,
charges, expenses, assessments, claims or liabilities in connection with the
performance of this Agreement, except such as may arise from its or its
nominee's own negligent action, negligent failure to act or willful misconduct,
any property at any time held for the account of the Company shall be security
therefor and should the Company fail to repay State Street promptly, State
Street shall be entitled to utilize available cash and to dispose of the
Company's assets to the extent necessary to obtain reimbursement.

In no event shall State Street be liable for indirect, special or consequential
damages.

SECTION 12. TERM AND TERMINATION.

            designate a successor record keeper (which may be Company) by Proper
            Instruction; and (c) designate a successor custodian (which may be
            Company) by Proper Instruction.

      2.    Upon payment of all sums due to it from Company, State Street shall
            (a) deliver all accounts and records to the successor recordkeeper
            (or, if none, to Company) at the office of State Street; and (b)
            deliver to the successor custodian at the office of State Street,
            duly endorsed and in the form for transfer, all Assets of Company
            then held by it hereunder and shall transfer to an account of the
            successor custodian all of the Assets of Company held in any
            Securities System.

in the event that no successor custodian has been designed on or before the date
when such termination shall become effective, then State Street shall have the
right to deliver to a bank or trust company, which is a bank doing business in
the United States (including any state) of its own selection and having an
aggregate capital, surplus, and undivided profits, as shown by its last
published report, of not less than $10,000,000 all Assets held by State Street,
its agents or its sub-custodians on behalf of Company and all instruments held
by State Street, its agents or its sub-custodians relative thereto and all other
property held by it hereunder and to transfer to an account of such successor
custodian all of the Assets held in any Securities System. Thereafter, such bank
or trust company shall be the successor of State Street hereunder.

In the event that Assets remain in the possession of State Street after the date
of termination hereof owing to failure of Company to designate a successor
custodian, State Street shall be entitled to fair compensation for its services
during such period as State Street retains possession of such Assets, and the
provisions hereof relating to the duties and obligations of State Street as
custodian shall remain in full force and effect. in the event that accounts and
records remain in the possession of State Street after the date of termination
hereof for any reason other than State Street's failure to deliver the same,
State Street shall be entitled to compensation for storage thereof during such
period, and shall be entitled to destroy the same if not removed by Company
within twenty (20) days after written demand.

provisions shall be in a writing signed by both parties and shall be annexed
hereto, provided that no such interpretive or additional provisions shall
contravene any applicable federal or state regulations. No interpretive or
additional provisions made as provided in the preceding sentence shall be deemed
to be an amendment of this Agreement.

                      FUNDS TRANSFER OPERATING GUIDELINES

1. OBLIGATION OF THE SENDER: State STREET Bank and Trust Company ("State
Street") is authorized to promptly debit Client's (as named below) account(s)
upon the receipt of a payment order in compliance with any of the Security
Procedures chosen by the Client, from those offered on the attached selection
form (and any updated selection forms hereafter executed by the Client), for
funds transfers and in the amount of money that State Street has been instructed
to transfer. State Street shall execute payment orders in compliance with the
delivery methods and Security Procedures indicated on the attached selection
form (and any updated section forms hereafter executed by the Client) and with
the Client's (or its investment Manager's) instructions on the execution date
provided that such payment order is received by the customary deadline for
processing such a request, unless the payment order specifies a later time.
State Street will use reasonable efforts to execute on the execution date
payment orders received after the customary deadline, but if it is unable to
execute any such payment order on the execution date, such payment order will be
deemed to have been received on the next business day.

2. SECURITY PROCEDURES: The Client acknowledges that the selected Security
Procedures were selected by the Client from Security Procedures offered by State
Street. The Client agrees that the Security Procedures are reasonable and
adequate for its wire transfer transactions and agrees to be bound by any
payment orders, amendments and cancellations, whether or not authorized, issued
in its name and accepted by State Street after being confirmed by any of the
selected Security Procedures. The Client also agrees to be bound by any other
valid and authorized payment order accepted by State Street. The Client shall
restrict access to confidential information relating to the Security Procedures
to authorized persons as communicated in writing to State Street. The Client
must notify State Street immediate1y if it has reason to believe unauthorized
persons may have obtained access to such information or of any change in the
Client's authorized personnel. State Street shall verify the authenticity of all
instructions according to the selected Security Procedures.

3. ACCOUNT NUMBERS: State Street shall process all payment orders on the basis
of the account number contained in the payment order. In the event of a
discrepancy between any name indicated on the payment order and the account
number, the account number shall take precedence and govern. Financial
institutions that receive payment orders initiated by State Street at the
instruction of the Client may also process payment orders on the basis of
account numbers, regardless of any name included in the payment order. State
Street will also rely on any financial institution identification numbers
included in any payment order, regardless of any financial institution name
included in the payment order.

4. REJECTION: State Street reserves the right to decline to process or delay the
processing of a payment order which (a) is in excess of the collected balance in
the account to be charged at the time of State Street's receipt of such payment
order; (b) if initiating such payment order would cause State Street, in State
Street's sole judgment, to exceed any applicable volume, aggregate dollar,
network, time, credit or similar limits upon wire transfers; or (c) if State
Street, in good faith, is unable to satisfy itself that the transaction has been
properly authorized.

5. CANCELLATION OR AMENDMENT: State Street shall use reasonable efforts to act
on all authorized requests to cancel or amend payment orders received in
compliance with the selected Security Procedures provided that such requests are
received in a timely manner affording State Street a reasonable opportunity to
act. However, State Street assumes no liability if the request for amendment or
cancellation cannot be satisfied.

6. ERRORS: State Street shall assume no responsibility for failure to detect any
erroneous payment order provided that State Street complies

                                       1
<PAGE>

with the payment order instructions as received and State Street complies with
the selected Security Procedures. The Security Procedures are established for
the purpose of authenticating payment orders only and not for the detection of
errors in payment orders.

7. INTEREST AND LIABILITY LIMITS: State Street shall assume no responsibility
for lost interest with respect to the refundable amount of any unauthorized
payment order, unless State Street is notified of the unauthorized payment order
within thirty (30) days of notification by State Street of the acceptance of
such payment order. In no event shall State Street be liable for special,
indirect or consequential damages, even if advised of the possibility of such
damages and even for failure to execute a payment order.

8. AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE ("ACH") CREDIT ENTRIES/PROVISIONAL PAYMENTS: When
the Client initiates or receives ACH credit and debit entries pursuant to these
Guidelines and the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association,
the New England Clearing House Association and the Mid-America Payment Exchange
or other similar body, State Street or its agent will act as an Originating
Depository Financial Institution and/or Receiving Depository Financial
Institution, as the case may be, with respect to such entries. Credits given by
State Street or its agent with respect to an ACH credit entry are provisional
until final settlement for such entry is received from the Federal Reserve Bank.
If such final settlement is not received, the Client agrees to promptly refund
the amount credited to the Client in connection with such entry, and the party
making payment to the Client via such entry shall not be deemed to have paid the
amount of the entry.

9. CONFIRMATIONS: Confirmation of State Street's execution of payment orders
shall ordinarily be provided within 24 hours. Notice may be delivered through
State Street's information systems, account statements, advices, or by facsimile
or callback. The Client must report any objections to the execution of a payment
order within 30 days.

10. MISCELLANEOUS: State Street and the Client agree to cooperate to attempt to
recover any funds erroneously paid to wrong parties, regardless of any fault of
State Street or the Client, but the party responsible for the erroneous payment
shall bear all costs and expenses incurred in trying to effect such recovery.
These Guidelines may not be amended except by a written agreement signed by the
parties.

11. LIABILITY ON FOREIGN ACCOUNTS: State Street shall not be required to repay
any deposit made at a non-U.S. branch of State Street, or any deposit made with
State Street and denominated in a non-U.S. dollar currency, if repayment of
such deposit or the use of assets denominated in the non-U.S. dollar currency is
prevented, prohibited or otherwise blocked due to: (A) an act of war,
insurrection or civil strife; (b) any action by a non-U.S. government or
instrumentality or authority asserting governmental, military or police power of
any kind, whether such authority be recognized as a de facto or a de jure
government, or by any entity, political or revolutionary movement or otherwise
that usurps, supervenes or otherwise materially impairs the normal operation of
civil authority; or (c) the closure of a non-U.S. branch of State Street in
order to prevent, in the reasonable judgment of State Street, harm to the
employees or property of State Street. The obligation to repay any such deposit
shall not be transferred to and may not be enforced against any other branch of
State Street.

The foregoing provisions constitute the disclosure required by Massachusetts
General Laws, Chapter 167D, Section 36.

While State Street is not obligated to repay any deposit made at a non-U.S.
branch or any deposit denominated in a non-U.S. currency during the period in
which its repayment has been prevented, prohibited or otherwise blocked, State
Street will repay such deposit when and if all circumstances preventing,
prohibiting or otherwise blocking repayment cease to exist.

                       SECURITY PROCEDURES SELECTION FORM

PLEASE SELECT AT LEAST two of the funds transfer security procedures indicated
below.

| |   SWIFT

      SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is a
      cooperative society owned and operated by member financial institutions
      that provides te1ecommunication services for its membership. Participation
      is limited to securities brokers and dealers, clearing and depository
      institutions, recognized exchanges for securities, and investment
      management institutions. SWIFT provides a number of security features
      through encryption and authentication to protect against unauthorized
      access, loss or wrong delivery of messages, transmission errors, loss of
      confidentiality and fraudulent changes to messages.

      Selection of this security procedure would be most appropriate for
      existing SWIFT members.

| |   REMOTE BATCH TRANSMISSION

      Wire transfer instructions are delivered via Computer-to-Computer
      (CPU-CPU) data communications between the Client and/or its agent and
      State Street and/or its agent. Security procedures include encryption
      and/or the use of a test key by those individuals authorized as Automated
      Batch Verifiers or a callback procedure to those individuals.

      Clients selecting this option should have an existing facility for
      completing (CPU-CPU) transmissions. This delivery mechanism is typically
      used for high-volume business such as shareholder redemptions and dividend
      payments.

| |   AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE (ACH)

      State Street or its agent receives an automated transmission from a Client
      For the initiation of payment (credit) or collection (debit) transactions
      through the ACH network. The transactions contained on each transmission
      or tape must be authenticated by the Client. The transmission is sent from
      the Client's or its agent's system to State Street's or its agent's system
      with encryption.

| |   REPETITIVE WIRES

      For situations where funds are transferred periodically from an existing
      authorized account to the same payee (destination bank and account number)
      and only the date and currency amount are variable, a repetitive wire may
      be implemented. Repetitive wires will be subject to a $10 million limit.
      If the payment order exceeds the $10 million limit, the instruction will
      be confirmed by Telephone Confirmation (Call Back) or Test Key prior to
      execution. Repetitive wire instructions must be reconfirmed annually.
      Clients may establish Repetitive Wires by following the agreed upon
      security procedures as described by Telephone Confirmation (Call Back) or
      Test Key.

      This alternative is recommended whenever funds are frequently transferred
      between the same two accounts. If this option is selected, choose either
      Telephone Confirmation or Test Key to be used as a secondary procedure
      when over $10 million.

| |    STANDING INSTRUCTIONS

      Funds are transferred by State Street to a counter party on the Client's
      established list of authorized counter parties. Only the date and the
      dollar amount are variable. Clients may establish Standby Instructions by
      following the agreed upon security procedures as described by Telephone
      Confirmation (Call Back) or Test Key. Additional paperwork will be
      required from insurance Clients using 1031 drawdowns.

      This option is used for transactions that include but are not limited to
      Foreign Exchange Contracts, Time Deposits and Tri-Party Repurchase
      Agreements. If this option is selected, choose either Telephone
      Confirmation or Test Key to be used as a secondary procedure when over
      $10 million.

| |   TELEPHONE CONFIRMATION (CALL BACK)

      This procedure requires Clients to designate individuals as authorized
      initiators and authorized verifiers. State Street will verify that the
      instruction contains the signature of an authorized person and, prior to
      execution of the payment order, will contact someone other than the
      originator at the Client's location to authenticate the instruction.

      Selection of the alternative is appropriate for Clients who do not have
      the capability to use other security procedures. Please complete the
      Telephone Confirmation Instructions attached as a Schedule hereto.

| |   TEST KEY

      Test Key confirmation will be used to verify all non-repetitive funds
      transfer instructions received via facsimile or phone. State Street will
      provide test keys if this option is chosen. State Street will verify that
      the instruction contains the signature of an authorized person and, prior
      to execution of the payment order, will authenticate the test key provided
      with the corresponding test key at State Street.

      Selection of this alternative is appropriate for Clients who do not have
      the capability to use other security procedures.

The individual signing below must be authorized to sign contract on behalf of
the Client. The execution of payment orders under the selected Security
Procedures is governed by the Funds Transfer Operating Guidelines, which are
incorporated by reference.

                         REMOTE ACCESS SERVICES ADDENDUM

      State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street") has developed
proprietary accounting and other systems, and has acquired licenses for other
such systems, which it utilizes in conjunction with the services we provide to
you (the "Systems"). In this regard, we maintain certain information in
databases under our control and ownership that we make available on a remote
basis to our customers (the "Remote Access Service").

      The Services. This addendum shall govern use of all Systems that State
Street may from time to time agree to provide you, the Customer, and your
designated investment advisors, consultants or other third parties authorized by
State Street who agree to abide by the terms of this addendum ("Authorized
Designees") in order to provide Remote Access Services for the purpose of
obtaining and analyzing reports and information.

      Security Procedures. You agree to comply, and to cause your Authorized
Designees to comply, with remote access operating standards and procedures and
with user identification or other password control requirements and other
security procedures as may be issued from time to time by State Street for use
of the Systems and access to the Remote Access Services. You agree to advise
State Street immediately in the event that you learn or have reason to believe
that any person to whom you have given access to the Systems or the Remote
Access Services has violated or intends to violate the terms of this addendum
and you will cooperate with State Street in seeking injunctive or other
equitable relief. You agree to discontinue use of the Systems and Remote Access
Services, if requested, for any security reasons cited by State Street.

      Fees. Fees and charges (if any) for the use of the Systems and the Remote
Access Services and related payment terms shall be as set forth in Schedule A.
You shall be responsible for any tariffs, duties or taxes imposed or levied by
any government or governmental agency by reason of the transactions contemplated
by this addendum, including, without limitation, federal, state and local taxes,
use, value added and personal property taxes (other than income, franchise or
similar taxes which may be imposed or assessed against State Street). Any
claimed exemption from such tariffs, duties or taxes shall be supported by
proper documentary evidence delivered to State Street.

      Proprietary Information/Injunctive Relief. The Systems and Remote Access
Services and the databases, computer programs, screen formats, report formats,
interactive design techniques, formulae, processes, systems, software, know-how,
algorithms, programs, training aids, printed materials, methods, books, records,
files, documentation and other information made available to you by State Street
as part of the Remote Access Services and through the use of the Systems and all
copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other proprietary rights of State Street
and its relevant licensors related thereto are the exclusive, valuable and
confidential property of State Street and its relevant licensors, as applicable
(the "Proprietary information"). You agree on behalf of yourself and your
Authorized Designees to keep the Proprietary Information confidential and to
limit access to your employees and Authorized Designees (under a similar duty of
confidentiality) who require access to the Systems for the purposes intended.
The foregoing shall not apply to Proprietary information in the public domain or
required by law to be made public.


                                       6
<PAGE>


      You agree to use the Remote Access Services only in connection with the
proper purposes of this addendum. You will not, and will cause your employees
and Authorized Designees not to, (i) permit any third party to use the Systems
or the Remote Access Services, (ii) sell, rent, license or otherwise use the
Systems or the Remote Access Services in the operation of a service bureau or
for any purpose other than as expressly authorized under this addendum, (iii)
use the Systems or the Remote Access Services for any fund, trust or other
investment vehicle without the prior written consent of State Street, or (iv)
allow or cause any information transmitted from State Street's databases,
including data from third party sources, available through use of the Systems or
the Remote Access Services, to be redistributed or retransmitted for other than
use for or on behalf of yourse1f, as our Customer.

      You agree that neither you nor your Authorized Designees will modify the
Systems in any way, enhance or otherwise create derivative works based upon the
Systems, nor will you or your Authorized Designees reverse engineer, decompile
or otherwise attempt to secure the source code for all or any part of the
Systems.

      You acknowledge that the disclosure of any Proprietary Information, or of
any information which at law or equity ought to remain confidential, will
immediately give rise to continuing irreparable injury inadequately compensable
in damages at law, and that State Street and its licensor, if applicable, shall
be entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against the breach or
threatened breach of any of the foregoing undertakings, in addition to any other
legal remedies which may be available.

      Limited Warranties. State Street represents and warrants that it has the
right to grant access to the Systems and to provide the Remote Access Services
contemplated herein. Because of the nature of computer information technology
and the necessity of relying upon third-party sources, and data and pricing
information obtained from third parties, the Systems and Remote Access Services
are provided "AS IS," and you and your Authorized Designees shall be solely
responsible for the investment decisions, regulatory reports and statements
produced using the Remote Access Services. State Street and its relevant
licensors will not be liable to you or your Authorized Designees for any direct
or indirect, special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages arising out
of or in any way connected with the Systems or the Remote Access Services, nor
shall either party be responsible for delays or nonperformance under this
Agreement arising out of any cause or event beyond such party's control.

      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, STATE STREET FOR ITSELF
AND ITS RELEVANT LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES
CONCERNING THE SYSTEM AND THE SERVICES TO BE RENDERED HEREUNDER, WHETHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      Infringement. State Street will defend or, at our option, settle any claim
or action brought against you to the extent that it is based upon an assertion
that access to any proprietary System


                                       7
<PAGE>

developed and owned by State Street or use of the Remote Access Services through
any such proprietary System by you under this addendum constitutes direct
infringement of any United States patent or copyright or misappropriation of a
trade secret, provided that you notify State Street promptly in writing of any
such claim or proceeding and cooperate with State Street in the defense of such
claim or proceeding. Should any such proprietary System or the Remote Access
Services accessed thereby or any part thereof become, or in State Street's
opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement or the like
under the patent or copyright or trade secret laws of the United States, State
Street shall have the right, at State Street's sole option, to (i) procure for
you the right to continue using such System or Remote Access Services, (ii)
replace or modify such System or Remote Access Services so that the System or
the Remote Access Services becomes noninfringing, or (iii) terminate this
Agreement without further obligation.

      Termination. Either party may terminate this Addendum in accordance with
Section 12 of the Custodian and Accounting Services Agreement or immediately for
failure of the other party to comply with any material term and condition of the
addendum by giving the other party written notice of termination. This addendum
shall in any event terminate within ninety (90) days after the termination of
any State Street custodian, accounting or other services agreement applicable to
you. In the event of termination, you will return to State Street all copies of
documentation and other confidential information in your possession or in the
possession of your Authorized Designees. The foregoing provisions with respect
to confidentiality and infringement will survive termination for a period of
three (3) years.

      Miscellaneous. Except as provided in the next sentence, this addendum
constitutes our entire understanding with respect to access to the Systems and
the Remote Access Services. If any State Street custody, accounting or other
services agreement with you contains terms and conditions relating to computer
systems or data access, this addendum shall constitute an amendment and
supplement to them, and in the event of any inconsistency the provisions
providing the greatest benefit to State Street shall control. This addendum
cannot be modified or altered except in a writing duly executed by both of us
and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

                                CONTROL AGREEMENT

      Control Agreement dated as of November____, 2002, by and among ST. PAUL
REINSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED ("PARTY A"), PLATINUM RE (UK) LIMITED ("PARTY B"),
and STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY ("CUSTODIAN") (the "AGREEMENT").

      WHEREAS, pursuant to a custodian and investment accounting agreement
between Custodian and various affiliated parties including Party B (as amended,
the "CUSTODIAN AGREEMENT"), Custodian acts as custodian for Party B's assets
and, as such Custodian, has established a custodial account in the name of Party
B in which the Collateral, as defined below (together with other assets of Party
B) is held; and

      WHEREAS, Party A and Party B have entered into a retrocession agreement,
dated as of November _, 2002 (the "RETROCESSION AGREEMENT") and a security
agreement, dated as of November, 2002 in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(the "SECURITY AGREEMENT") pursuant to the terms of which, Party B will from
time to time grant a continuing first priority security interest over certain
assets specified by Party B and identified in writing to Custodian as Collateral
as defined in the Security Agreement (the "COLLATERAL") to secure Party B's
obligations under the Retrocession Agreements; and

      WHEREAS, Party A, Party B and Custodian are entering into this Agreement
for the purpose of appointing Custodian to serve as collateral agent for Party A
and to serve as securities intermediary as herein provided in order to provide
Party A with control of the Collateral Accounts and the Collateral credited
thereto and held therein (each as defined below), in each case for the purpose
of perfecting and establishing the priority of Party A's security interest in
such Collateral;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein,
it is agreed as follows:

1. APPOINTMENT AND ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTS.

      1.1 Party A hereby appoints Custodian as collateral agent on its behalf
and Custodian hereby accepts such appointment. In addition, Custodian agrees to
act as securities intermediary and/or depositary bank, as applicable, with
respect to the Collateral Accounts and the Collateral held therein pursuant
hereto.

      1.2 The Custodian has established and will maintain a segregated account
(which may include one or more sub-accounts) entitled "Platinum Re (UK) Limited
for the Benefit of St. Paul Reinsurance Company Limited" (the "Securities
Account"); and a separate and segregated deposit account or accounts (as defined
in Section 9-102 of the UCC) entitled "Platinum Re (UK) Limited for the Benefit
of St. Paul Reinsurance Company Limited" (the "Deposit Account", and together
with the Securities Account, the "COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS"), all as more
particularly described on the attached Schedule 1, hereto. Each party hereto
agrees that (i) the Securities Account constitutes a "securities account" within
the meaning of Article 8 of the UCC, and (ii) all property now or hereafter
held, credited or carried by, in or to the credit of Securities


                                       1
<PAGE>

Account (other than "Identified Securities", as defined in Section 5(vi), and
cash) shall be treated as "financial assets" within the meaning of UCC Section
8-102(a)(9). Each of the Collateral Accounts shall be maintained separately and
apart from any other account or sub-account of Party B. The Custodian shall not
change the name of the Collateral Accounts without the prior written consent of
Party A. Except for specified "Identified Securities", as provided hereinafter,
Party B agrees that all financial assets credited to the Collateral Accounts
shall be registered in the name of the Custodian, endorsed to the Custodian or
in blank or credited to another securities account maintained in the name of the
Custodian, and except for such Identified Securities, no financial asset
credited to the Collateral Accounts shall be registered in the name of Party B,
payable to the order of Party B or specially endorsed to Party B except to the
extent the foregoing have been specially endorsed to the Custodian or in blank.

      1.3 The Custodian agrees that it shall promptly notify Party A and Party B
in writing after becoming aware that any financial asset which constitutes
Collateral is registered or endorsed otherwise than as provided in the foregoing
Section 1.2; provided, however, that the Custodian shall have no liability
hereunder for the failure to deliver such notice except to the extent such
failure results from its negligence or misconduct.

      1.4 Party B, from time to time, shall instruct Custodian in writing by any
of the means mutually agreed to between Party B and Custodian (which shall
constitute "Proper instructions" under the Custodian Agreement), to segregate
and hold in a separate account the Collateral for the benefit of Party A,
whereupon any such Collateral, other than cash Collateral, shall be credited to
and held in the Securities Account, and any such cash Collateral shall be
credited to and held in the Deposit Account. Custodian shall have no
responsibility for determining the adequacy of any Collateral required hereunder
or under the Retrocession Agreement, nor will it assume responsibility for any
calculations related to any Collateral requirements under the Retrocession
Agreement.

      1.5 All Cash Proceeds (as defined in UCC Section 9-l02(a)(9)) of the
Collateral received by the Custodian, except for the Distributions (as defined
in the Security Agreement (the "Distributions")), shall be deposited in the
Collateral Accounts and become part of the Collateral.

2. Account Control.


      2.1 Security interest. This Agreement is intended by Party A and Party B
to grant "control" of the Collateral Accounts to Party A for purposes of the
perfection and priority of Party A's security interest in such Collateral
pursuant to Article 8 and Article 9 of the UCC, and Custodian hereby
acknowledges that it has been advised of Party B's grant to Party A of a
security interest in the Collateral Accounts and the Collateral held therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Custodian makes no representation or warranty
with respect to the creation or enforceability of any security interest in the
Collateral Accounts or the Collateral held therein. Custodian shall promptly and
in the exercise of due care and reasonable commercial standards comply with
"entitlement orders" (as that term is defined in UCC Section 8-102(a)(8)),
including but not limited to a Notice of Exclusive Control substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B ("NOTICE OF EXCLUSIVE CONTROL"), originated by
Party A and concerning the Collateral, without the further consent of Party B,
including without limitation any entitlement order originated by Party A
instructing the Custodian to deliver any or all of the Collateral to Party A


                                       2
<PAGE>

or its designees.

      2.2 Control by Party B. Unless and except to the extent it has received a
contrary entitlement order from Party A pursuant to Section 2.1, and except as
provided in Section 2.3(i), below: (i) Custodian shall take actions with respect
to the Collateral in the Collateral Accounts upon the instructions of Party B,
and (ii) Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability to Party A or Party
B for actions taken in accordance with such instructions. All entitlement orders
and other instructions and communications that Party B is entitled, or desires,
to give or make under this Agreement may be given or made either by Party B
itself or its investment advisor as designated in writing by Party B to the
Custodian from time to time.

      2.3 Control by Party A.

      (i) Party A agrees to provide Custodian, in the form of Exhibit C attached
(as may be amended from time to time), the names and signatures of authorized
parties who may give notices, instructions, or entitlement orders concerning the
Collateral Accounts and the Collateral held therein. All entitlement orders and
other instructions and communications that Party A is entitled, or desires, to
give or make under this Agreement may be given or made either by Party A itself
or its attorney in fact, as designated in writing by Party A to the Custodian
from time to time. Other means of notice, instruction, or entitlement orders may
be used provided that Party A and Custodian agree to appropriate security
procedures. Upon receipt by Custodian of a Notice of Exclusive Control, and
unless and until such Notice of Exclusive Control has been revoked in writing by
Party A, Custodian shall thereafter follow only the instructions of Party A with
respect to the Collateral Accounts and shall comply with any entitlement order
or instructions (within the meaning of Sections 8-102, 9-104, and 9-106 of the
UCC) received from Party A, without further consent of Party B or any other
person, and Custodian will not comply with entitlement orders or instructions
concerning the Collateral originated by Party B without the prior written
consent of Party A.

      (ii) Party A represents and warrants to Party B that Party A will only
issue to Custodian a Notice of Exclusive Control if Party A has determined in
good faith that an event has occurred which entitles Party A to exercise its
rights as a secured party with respect to the Collateral in the Collateral
Accounts.

      (iii) Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability to Party B for
complying with a Notice of Exclusive Control or complying with entitlement
orders or instructions originated by Party A concerning the Collateral Accounts
and the Collateral held therein. Custodian shall have no duty to investigate or
make any determination to verify compliance by Party A or Party B with
applicable law. Nor shall Custodian have any duty to verify the occurrence of an
event entitling Party A to exercise its rights as a secured party with respect
to the Collateral in the Collateral Accounts, and Custodian shall be fully
protected in complying with a Notice of Exclusive Control whether or not Party B
may allege that no such event has occurred.

      (iv) As between Party A and Custodian, notwithstanding any provision
contained herein or in any other document or instrument to the contrary,
Custodian shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken at the
instruction of Party A, or any action taken or omitted to be taken under or in
connection with this Agreement, except for Custodian's own negligence or willful
misconduct in carrying out such instructions.


                                       3

3. DISTRIBUTIONS. Custodian shall transfer the Distributions to the Party B
within ten (10) days following the end of each calendar month, upon proper
written instructions by Party B, to Party B's custodial account or any other
account designated by Party B unless Custodian has received a Notice of
Exclusive Control and, if any Notice of Exclusive Control is in effect, until
such Notice of Exclusive Control has been revoked or rescinded in writing by
Party A. The Distributions shall not be considered Collateral.

4. RELEASE OF COLLATERAL; RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST.

      4.1 Release of Collateral. As soon as reasonably practicable after
receiving joint instructions from Party A and Party B, Custodian will release
Collateral held in the Collateral Accounts in accordance with such instructions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Custodian will release Collateral held in the
Collateral Accounts upon receipt from Party B of a Substitution Notice as
defined in the Security Agreement notifying Custodian of Party B's intention to
substitute Qualified Assets as defined in the Security Agreement and in
accordance with instructions from Party B that comport with such Substitution
Notice, provided, that no contrary instructions have been received from Party A,
and that no Notice of Exclusive Control is then in effect.

      4.2 Release of Security Interest. Party A agrees to notify Custodian
promptly in writing when all obligations of Party B to Party A under the
Retrocession Agreement and the Security Agreement have been fully satisfied or
Party A otherwise no longer claims any interest in the Collateral in the
Collateral Accounts, whichever is sooner; at which time Custodian shall have no
further liabilities or responsibilities hereunder and Custodian's obligations
under this Agreement shall terminate.

5. DUTIES AND SERVICES OF CUSTODIAN.

      (i) Custodian agrees that it is acting as a securities intermediary, as
defined in Section 8-102 of the UCC with respect to the Collateral in the
Securities Account, except Identified Securities. Custodian agrees, with respect
to the Deposit Account, that it is acting as a "bank" as such term is used in
Section 9-102(a)(29) of the UCC. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
Custodian Agreement is governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
and that, as a consequence, the jurisdiction of Custodian as securities
intermediary and as bank is The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

      (ii) Custodian shall have no duties, obligations, responsibilities or
liabilities with respect to the Collateral Accounts and the Collateral held
therein except as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement and
the Custodian Agreement, and no implied duties of any kind shall be read into
this Agreement against Custodian including, without limitation, the duty to
preserve, exercise or enforce rights in the Collateral and the Collateral
Accounts. Custodian shall not be liable or responsible for anything done or
omitted to be done by it in good faith and in the absence of negligence and may
rely and shall be protected in acting upon any notice, instruction, entitlement
orders, or other communication which it reasonably believes to be genuine and
authorized.

      (iii) As between Party B and Custodian, except for the rights of control
in favor of Party A agreed to herein, nothing herein shall be deemed to modify,
limit, restrict, amend or supersede the terms of the Custodian Agreement, and
Custodian shall be and remain entitled to all of the rights, indemnities,
powers, and protections in its favor under the Custodian


                                       4
<PAGE>

Agreement, which shall apply fully to Custodian's actions and omissions
hereunder. Instructions under this Agreement from Party B's authorized
representative given in accordance with the terms of the Custodian Agreement
shall also constitute Proper Instructions under the Custodian Agreement.

      (iv) As between Custodian and Party A, Party A shall indemnify and hold
Custodian harmless with regard to any losses or liabilities of Custodian
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) imposed on or incurred by Custodian
arising out of any action or omission of Custodian in accordance with any
notice, instruction, or entitlement order of Party A under this Agreement except
for actions or omissions due to Custodian's own negligence or willful
misconduct.

      (v) The parties hereto acknowledge that no "security entitlement" under
the UCC shall exist with respect to any cash or to any financial asset held in
the Collateral Accounts which is registered in the name of Party B, payable to
the order of the Party B, or specially indorsed to Party B or any third party
(each such asset an "IDENTIFIED SECURITY"), except to the extent such Identified
Security has been specially indorsed by Party B to Custodian or in blank. The
parties further acknowledge and agree that any such cash and/or Identified
Securities received by Custodian and credited to the Collateral Accounts from
time to time shall (so long as so credited to the Collateral Accounts and so
long as this Agreement remains in effect) be held by Custodian for the benefit
of and on behalf of Party A, not in its capacity as a "securities intermediary"
(as defined in the UCC), but in its capacity as a collateral agent under and
subject to the terms of this Agreement.

      (vi) For avoidance of doubt, Party A hereby acknowledges that any
Collateral in the Collateral Accounts issued outside the United States ("FOREIGN
SECURITY SYSTEM ASSETS") which may be held by Custodian, a sub-custodian within
Custodian's network of sub-custodians (each a "SUB-CUSTODIAN") or a depository
or book-entry system for the central handling of securities and other financial
assets in which Custodian or the Sub-Custodian are participants may not permit
Party B to have a security entitlement under the UCC with respect to such
Foreign Security System Assets (and such property shall be deemed for purposes
of this Agreement not to be a financial asset held within the Collateral
Accounts). The parties hereby further acknowledge that Custodian gives no
assurance that a security entitlement is created under the UCC with respect to
Party B's assets held in Euroclear or Clearstream or their successors.

      (vii) Custodian shall from time to time employ one or more sub-custodians
in accordance with the terms of the Custodian Agreement.

6. FORCE MAJEURE; SPECIAL DAMAGES. Custodian shall not be liable for delays,
errors or losses occurring by reason of circumstances beyond its control,
including, without limitation, acts of God, market disorder, terrorism,
insurrection, war, riots, failure of transportation or equipment, or failure of
vendors, communication or power supply. In no event shall Custodian be liable to
any person for indirect, consequential or special damages, even if Custodian has
been advised of the possibility or likelihood of such damages.

7. COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL PROCESS AND JUDICIAL ORDERS. Custodian shall have no
responsibility or liability to Party A or Party B or to any other person or
entity for acting in accordance with any judicial or arbitral process, order,
writ, judgment, decree or claim of lien relating to the Collateral Accounts and
the Collateral held therein subject to this Agreement notwithstanding that such
order or process is subsequently modified, vacated or otherwise


                                       5
<PAGE>

determined to have been without legal force or effect.

8. CUSTODIAN REPRESENTATIONS. Custodian agrees and confirms, as of the date
hereof, and at all times until the termination of this Agreement, that it has
not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will not enter
into, any agreement (other than the Custodian Agreement) with any other person
or entity relating to the Collateral or the Collateral Accounts under which it
has agreed to comply with entitlement orders (as defined in Section 8-102 of the
UCC) of such other person or entity.

9. Access To Reports. Upon any pledge, release, or substitution of Collateral in
the Collateral Accounts, Custodian shall notify Party A within one business day
of such change. Custodian will provide to Party A a copy of a statement of the
Collateral Accounts and the Collateral held therein within five (5) business
days of the end of the calendar month; provided, however, that Custodian's
failure to forward a copy of such statement to Party A shall not give rise to
any liability hereunder.

10. INTERPLEADER. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event of any dispute concerning this Agreement or the
disposition of any of the Collateral or the Collateral Accounts, Custodian shall
have the absolute right, at its election, to (a) refrain from taking any action
(other than to hold the Collateral in accordance with the Custodian Agreement)
until directed by written instructions signed by Party B and Party A or by final
order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (b) in the event of litigation
between Party B and Party A, deliver all of the Collateral in the Collateral
Accounts to the clerk of any court in which such litigation is pending, or file
suit in interpleader and deliver the Collateral in the Collateral Accounts to
the court in which the action is commenced, and obtain an order from the court
requiring the parties to interplead and litigate in such court their claims and
rights among themselves, whereupon Custodian shall thereby be relieved from any
further liability respecting the Collateral and the Collateral Accounts.

11. FEES AND EXPENSES OF CUSTODIAN. In addition to the terms of the Custodian
Agreement, Party B hereby agrees to pay and reimburse Custodian for any
advances, fees, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorney's fees and costs) and disbursements that may be paid or incurred by
Custodian in connection with this Agreement or the arrangement contemplated
hereby, including any that may be incurred in performing its duties or
responsibilities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Any fees, expenses or
other amounts that may be owing to Custodian from time to time pursuant to the
terms hereof, or of the Custodian Agreement shall be secured by any lien,
encumbrance or other right Custodian may have under the Custodian Agreement or
applicable law, and Custodian shall be entitled to exercise its rights and
remedies against the Collateral and Collateral Accounts in accordance with the
term's and conditions of the Custodian Agreement.

It is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by the parties that Custodian
(including its agents) shall not be obligated to advance cash or investments to,
for or on behalf of Party B in the Collateral Accounts, provided, however, that
if Custodian does advance cash or investments to the Collateral Accoun1s for any
purpose (including but not limited to securities settlements, foreign exchange
contracts, assumed settlement or account overdraft) for the benefit of Party B,
any property at any time held pursuant to this Agreement and the Custodian
Agreement shall be security therefor and, should Party B fail to repay Custodian
promptly, Custodian shall be entitled to utilize available cash and to dispose
of Collateral in the Collateral Accounts to the


                                       6
<PAGE>

extent necessary to obtain reimbursement.

12. NOTICES. Any notice, instruction, entitlement order, or other instrument
required to be given hereunder, or requests and demands to or upon the
respective parties hereto, shall be in writing and may be sent by hand, or by
facsimile transmission, telex, or delivery by any recognized delivery service,

                   Discretionary Investment Advisory Agreement

                                      With

                            Platinum Re (UK) Limited



                             Dated November___, 2002
                                (Effective Date)

            Alliance Capital Management L.P. (the "Adviser") and Platinum Re
(UK) Limited (the "Client") hereby agree as of the above date that the Adviser
shall act as discretionary investment manager with respect to certain assets of
the Client described below (the "Investment Account") on the following terms and
conditions:

      1.    The investment Account

            The Investment Account established for the Client refer collectively
to the Collateral Accounts defined in and subject to a certain Control Agreement
by and among the Client, St. Paul Reinsurance Company Limited and State Street
Bank and Trust Company, dated as of November___, 2002 and established as a
condition of the 100% Quota Share Retrocession Agreement (Traditional) (the
"Quota Share Retrocession Agreement"), by and between the Client and St. Paul
Reinsurance Company Limited, dated as of November___, 2002, shall initially
consist of cash, cash equivalents, stocks, bonds, and other securities placed in
the Investment Account by the Client or which shall become part of such
Investment Account as a result of transactions.

            All cash, securities and other assets in the Investment Account
shall be held by such other party as the Client shall designate as trustee or
custodian for such account (each, a "Custodian"). The Adviser shall not be
responsible for any custodial arrangements involving the assets of the
Investment Account or for the payment of any custodial charges and fees, nor
shall the Adviser have possession or custody of any such assets. All payments,
distributions and other transactions in cash, securities or other assets in
respect of the investment Account shall be made directly to or from the
Custodian for such Investment Account, and the Adviser shall have no
responsibility or liability with respect to transmittal or safekeeping of such
cash, securities or other assets of an Investment Account, or the acts or
omissions of any Custodian or others with respect thereto. The Client may make
additions to or withdrawals from the Investment Account established for it,
provided the Adviser receives at least three (3) business days' prior written
notice of withdrawals. Should the Client fail to provide the Adviser with timely
written notice of any additions to or withdrawals from its Investment Account,
the Adviser shall not be liable for any resulting investment or other loss, if
any, which shall be incurred by or charged to the applicable investment Account,
as the case may be. The Client agrees to provide or instruct the

<PAGE>

Custodian for its Investment Account to provide to the Adviser such information
as the Adviser may reasonably request as being necessary or appropriate to the
performance of the Adviser's responsibilities to the Client under this
Agreement.

      2.    Services of Adviser

            By execution of this Agreement, the Adviser accepts its appointment
as investment manager for the Investment Account with full discretion and agrees
to supervise and direct the investments of the Investment Account in accordance
with the written investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the Client
previously furnished to the Adviser as the same may be amended by the Client
from time to time. In the performance of its services, the Adviser will not be
liable for any error in judgment or any acts or omissions to act except those
resulting from the Adviser's negligence, willful misconduct, malfeasance or
material breach of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall in any way constitute a
waiver or 1imitation of any right of any person under the Federal securities
laws or any state securities laws

            The Adviser will make available to the Client a daily report on the
positions of each of the investments in the Investment Account and a monthly
written report of the inventory of investments in the Investment Account
established for the Client. It is agreed that the Adviser, in the maintenance of
its records, does not assume responsibility for the accuracy of information
furnished by any Client or any other person.

      3.    Funding Policy

            The Client shall from time to time inform the Adviser in writing of
the funding policy applicable to it and of its cash disbursement requirements.
The Adviser shall make its investment decisions for an Investment Account in
accordance with such funding policy and requirements.

      4.    Investment Objectives, Policies and Restrictions

            It will be the responsibility of the Client to notify the Adviser in
writing of any modifications to Schedule A. The Client is also required to
notify the Adviser in writing of specific restrictions governing its Investment
Account under the current or future laws of any jurisdiction or by virtue of the
terms of any other contract or instrument purporting to bind the Client or the
Adviser.

      5.    Delivery of Client Documentation

            No later than the date of this Agreement, the Client will provide
the Adviser with copies of all documents relevant to the Adviser's management of
the Investment Account established for the Client, (i.e. trust agreement,
pension plan documents, by-laws, etc.), including the Client's written statement
of investment objectives, policies and restrictions referred to above. The
Client further agrees to promptly deliver to the Adviser true and complete
copies of


                                       2
<PAGE>


all amendments of supplements to such documents. The Client will indemnify and
hold harmless the Adviser against any and all losses, costs, claims and
liabilities which it may suffer or incur arising out of any failure by the
Client to provide to the Adviser the documents required to be furnished in
accordance with the above provisions.

      6.    Discretionary Authority

            The Adviser, whenever it deems appropriate may (i) buy, sell,
exchange, convert, liquidate or otherwise trade in any stock, bonds and other
securities (including money market instruments) and contracts relating to the
same, and (ii) subject to its duty to seek best execution, place orders for the
execution of such transactions with or through such brokers, dealers or issuers
as the Adviser in its absolute discretion may select.

            It is understood that, to the extent permitted by Schedule A, the
Adviser or Alliance Capital Global Derivatives Corporation, an affiliate of the
Adviser, may also effect transactions for the Investment Account of the Client
in options and futures and other commodity contracts. In such event, the Client
will execute any additional documentation which the Adviser deems necessary to
enable it or its affiliate to engage in such transactions on behalf of its
Investment Account. The Client represents and warrants that it is familiar with
the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act and the National Futures
Association pertaining to commodity pool operators and has determined that it is
in compliance with such requirements, to the extent applicable.

7.    Brokerage Transactions

            Fixed-income securities transactions for the investment Account will
generally be effected in dealer markets where the Adviser will act as agent for
the Client in the purchase or sale of fixed-income securities at a net price
that includes a mark-up from the dealer. The Adviser will issue instructions to
such issuers, brokers and dealers for the placement of orders for the Investment
Account and instruct such dealers to forward to the Client copies of all
confirmations promptly after the execution of transactions for the Client's
investment Account.

      8.    Aggregation of Transactions

            The Client authorizes the Adviser in its discretion to aggregate
purchases and sales of securities for its Investment Account with purchases and
sales of securities of the same issuer for other clients of the Adviser
occurring on the same day. When transactions are so aggregated, the actual
prices applicable to the aggregated transactions will be averaged, and the
Investment Account and the accounts of other participating clients of the
Adviser will be deemed to have purchased or sold their proportionate share of
the securities involved at the average price so obtained.

      9.    Transaction Procedures

            All transactions will be settled by payment to, or delivery by, the
applicable Custodian of all cash, securities or other assets due to or from the
investment Account. The


                                       3
<PAGE>

Adviser may issue such instructions to a Custodian as may be appropriate in
connection with the settlement of transactions initiated by the Adviser.
Instructions of the Adviser to a Custodian shall be transmitted in writing or,
at the option of the Adviser, orally and confirmed in writing as soon as
practical thereafter. The Adviser will take reasonable measures to insure that
broker-dealers and issuers selected by the Adviser perform their obligations
with respect to the Investment Accounts.

      10.   Fees

            The compensation of the Adviser for its services under this
Agreement shall be calculated and paid by the Client in respect of the
Investment Account established for it, in accordance with the Fee Schedule
attached hereto as Exhibit A, as the same may be amended from time to time by
mutual agreement between the Client and the Adviser. It is understood that, in
the event that such fees are to be billed to and paid by the Custodian for an
Investment Account, the Client will provide written authorization to the
Custodian to pay the fees of the Adviser directly from the Investment Account.
The Client shall be responsible solely for the fee due to the Adviser in respect
of the Investment Account established for such Client.

      11.   Confidential Relationship

            All information provided by the Client or a Custodian to the Adviser
shall be held as confidential by the Adviser; provided, however, as is necessary
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or as may be required by law, the
Adviser shall be permitted to disclose or communicate to a proper party any
information received from the Client or a Custodian or developed by the Adviser
under the terms of this Agreement. All recommendations, advice and other work
product of the Adviser developed under the terms of this Agreement and disclosed
to the Client or a Custodian shall be held as confidential, except as required
by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client hereby authorizes the Adviser to
disclose through whatever means it deems appropriate (CHECK THE APPROPRIATE

                         Client by the Adviser from time to time.

disclosure authorizations indicated in (a) through (c) above, the Client shall

information. The Client may revoke these authorizations in respect of itself, at
any time by written notice to the Adviser.

      12.   Services to Other Clients

            It is understood that the Adviser performs investment advisory
services for various clients including investment companies. The Client agrees
that the Adviser may give advice and take action with respect to any of its
other clients which may differ from advice given, or the timing or nature of
action taken, with respect to the investment Account established for it, so long
as it is the Adviser's policy, to the extent practical, to allocate investment
opportunities to the Investment Account over a period of time on a fair and
equitable basis relative to other clients.

            Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the Adviser or any
of its directors, officers, affiliates or employees from buying, selling or
trading in any securities or other assets for its or their own account or
accounts, and the Client acknowledges that the Adviser, its directors, officers,
affiliates and employees, and other clients of the Adviser, may at any time
have, acquire, increase, decrease or dispose of positions in investments which
are at the same time being acquired, held or disposed of for the Investment
Account.

            The Adviser will not have any obligation to initiate the purchase or
sale, or to recommend for purchase or sale, for the Investment Account any
security or other asset which the Adviser, its directors, officers, affiliates
or employees may purchase, hold or sell for its or their own accounts or for the
accounts of any other clients of the Adviser.

      13.   Non-Public Information

            The Adviser will have no obligation to purchase or sell for the
Investment Account the securities of any issuer on the basis of any material
non-public information as may come into its possession.

appointment of the Adviser as discretionary investment adviser entitled to give
entitlement orders or other instructions and communications to the Custodian is

Investment Account and that the terms of this Agreement do not violate any
provisions thereof or any obligation by which it is bound, whether arising by
contract, operation of law or otherwise; (ii) this Agreement has been duly
authorized by appropriate action and when executed and delivered will be binding
upon it in accordance with its terms; and (iii) it will deliver to the Adviser

into this Agreement and perform its duties hereunder.

      16.   Indemnification

            The Adviser agrees to indemnify and hold the Client harmless from
any and all expenses, damages, costs and fees, including reasonable attorney's
fees, which may be incurred by reason of the Adviser's negligence, willful
misconduct, malfeasance, material breach of this Agreement or violation of
applicable law.

      17.   Valuation

            In computing the market value of any security held in the Investment

pricing services utilized by the Adviser for pricing securities held in its
advisory accounts generally. Any other security or asset shall be valued in a
manner determined in good faith by the Adviser to reflect its fair market value.

Form ADV in compliance with Rule 204-3(b) under the Advisers Act more than forty

      19.   Notices

            Unless otherwise specified herein, all notices, instructions and
advice with respect to security transactions or any other matters contemplated
by this Agreement shall be deemed duly given when received by the Client and the
Adviser, as applicable, at their addresses appearing below. In respect of the
investment Account, the Adviser may rely upon any notice (written or oral) from
any person whom the Adviser reasonably believes to be an authorized
representative of the Client.

<PAGE>

Custodian of its Investment Account to forward a like list and specimen
signatures to the Adviser.

      21.   Invalid Provisions

            If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under present or future law, such provision shall be fully
severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this
Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or its severance from this Agreement.

      22.   Termination; Assignment; Amendment

portion thereof will be refunded to the Client. No assignment, as that term is
defined in the Advisers Act, shall be made by the Adviser without the written
consent of the Client. No assignment shall be deemed to result from changes in
the directors, officers or employees of the Adviser except as may be provided in
the Advisers Act. The Adviser agrees that it will notify the Client of any
change in the membership of the general partners of the Adviser within a
reasonable time after such change. This Agreement may be amended or modified at

OTHER RESTRICTIONS:

Futures and options are permitted, provided the instrument is used as a hedge,
with specific prior approval from Platinum.

-         Swaps
-         Futures
-         Exchange traded options
-         Over-the-counter options

Structured securities or securities with embedded options are permitted.
Leverage is not permitted.

In the case of a split rating, the lower of the ratings available shall apply.

Should a security be downgraded below investment grade (BBB-/Baa3) the manager
must notify and consult with Platinum as soon as reasonably practicable,
regarding the optimal timing of the disposal.

For securities with variable principal repayment, the estimated duration should
be used with respect to the duration restrictions.

All holdings must be denominated in the base currency of the relevant portfolio
(but including legacy currencies in the case of Euros).


WITHHOLDING TAXES:


<PAGE>

No investments shall be made that give rise to withholding taxes unless the
after-tax returns are competitive with unavailable returns on which withholding
taxes are not imposed, which will ordinarily only occur where the investor is
able to utilize the withheld taxes as a credit against its domestic income tax
liability. In general investments made with respect to the Bermuda account will,
in the case of securities issued by U.S. issuers, be limited to securities that
are eligible for the "portfolio interest exemption"- i.e., essentially
securities that are in registered form and not issued by a 10% or more
shareholder of Platinum Holdings.

KEY:

*     General obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its full
      faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.
      Revenue or special tax bonds are payable only from the revenues derived
      from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from
      the proceeds of a special excise or other tax, but not from general tax
      revenues. Municipal bonds will be utilized when there is an after-tax
      benefit to the portfolio.

**    No more than 25% of the portfolio assets can be invested in an industry.

***   For Credit Default Swaps, the rating of the reference entity will serve as
      the rating for the Swap.

quarter, the Debtor shall calculate the fair market value of the Assets held in

            (b) The excess of the Ending Reserves over the Ending Asset Value,
if any, shall be the "Excess Reserves". To the extent the Ending Reserves exceed
the Ending Asset Value, the Debtor shall within 3 Local Business Days deposit
sufficient Qualifying Assets with a fair market value equal to such Excess
Reserves. To the extent the Ending Asset Value exceeds the Ending Reserves, the
Secured Party shall, upon the Debtor's request, join the Debtor in instructing
the Custodian to release Collateral with a fair market value equal to the amount
of such excess, provided, however, that no Relevant Event has occurred and is
continuing.

the quarterly calculation from the Debtor, the Secured Party shall have the
right to reasonably object to such calculation and to offer a reasonable
proposal for the amount of the reserves described in Section 3.02 hereof. If the
parties in good faith are not able to resolve the disagreement within two weeks
of the Secured Party's indication of disagreement, the parties shall mutually
agree upon an independent actuarial firm to determine an appropriate level of
aggregate reserves as described in Section 3.02 hereof with respect to the
Reinsurance Contracts, such level to be no more than the amount proposed by the
Secured Party and no less than the amount reported by the Debtor, and both
parties agree to be bound by such determination. In such case the Debtor shall
deposit sufficient Qualifying Assets with a fair market value equal to Excess
Reserves (if any) within 3 Local Business Days after receipt of the actuary
report. The fees and expenses of the actuarial firm shall be shared equally by
the Debtor and the Secured Party.

            Section 3.04 Transfers. Subject to Section 3.03 and unless otherwise
agreed between the parties from time to time, if an obligation to transfer
Qualified Assets or Collateral has become due by the Notification Time, then the
relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business on the
Settlement Day relating to the date such obligation has become due; if an
obligation becomes due after the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer
will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating
to the day after the date such obligation became due.

            Section 3.05 Calculations. The parties agree that valuations
calculated by the Debtor or, as the case may be, by the Secured Party for the
purpose of this Agreement shall prevail over any valuations performed by or for
the Investment Adviser pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory
Agreement.

            Section 3.06 Substitutions.

            (a) The Debtor (acting, where applicable, through the Investment
Adviser) may on any Local Business Day by notice (a "Substitution Notice")
inform the Secured Party and the Custodian that it wishes to substitute the
Qualified Assets specified in that Substitution Notice (the "Substitute Credit
Support") for certain Qualified Assets specified in the Substitution Notice and
held in the Collateral Accounts (the "Original Credit Support").

            (b) Following the service of such Substitution Notice, the Original
Credit Support shall be released, upon written instructions by the Debtor, to
the Debtor against delivery of the Substitute Credit Support (or an undertaking
for such delivery) in accordance

credited thereto (other than joint instructions in accordance with this

Control shall be deemed to be revoked or rescinded upon receipt by the Custodian
from the Secured Party of written notice thereof. The Secured Party agrees to
deliver a notice of revocation or rescission upon request of the Debtor at any
time when no Relevant Event has occurred or is continuing.

            Section 5.06 Further Actions. The Debtor will, at its own expense,
make, execute, endorse, acknowledge, or otherwise authenticate and file and/or
deliver to the Secured Party from time to time such confirmatory assignments,
conveyances, financing statements, transfer endorsements, powers of attorney,
certificates and other assurances, instruments or other records, and take such
further steps relating to the Collateral and other property or rights covered by
the interests hereby granted, which the Secured Party, upon written direction,
deems reasonably appropriate or advisable to perfect, preserve or protect its
security interests in the Collateral.

            Section 5.07 Financing Statements. The Debtor agrees to execute or
otherwise authenticate (if necessary) and deliver to the Secured Party such
financing statements (or similar statement or instrument of registration under
the law of any jurisdiction), in form acceptable to the Secured Party as it may
from to time reasonably request or as are necessary or desirable time in its
reasonable opinion to establish and maintain the security interests
contemplated hereunder as valid, enforceable and first priority security
interests (subject to the Custodian Lien) as provided herein and the other
rights and security contemplated herein, all in accordance with the UCC as
enacted in any and all relevant jurisdictions or any other Requirement of Law.
The Debtor will pay any applicable filing fees and related expenses. The Debtor
authorizes the Secured Party to file any such financing statements without the
signature of the Debtor.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                   REMEDIES UPON OCCURRENCE OF RELEVANT EVENT

            Section 6.01 Remedies; Obtaining and Disposition of the Collateral
Upon Default. The Debtor agrees that, if any Relevant Event has occurred and is
continuing, then and in every such case, subject to any Requirements of Law, the
Secured Party may:

            (a) deliver a Notice of Exclusive Control, instructions or
entitlement orders with respect to the Collateral Accounts or the Collateral;

            (b) exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other
rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the
rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the UCC to enforce
this Agreement and the security interest contained herein, and also may (A) if
applicable, require the Debtor to, and the Debtor hereby agrees that it will at
its expense and upon request of the Secured Party forthwith, assemble all or
part of the Collateral as directed by the Secured Party and make it available to
the Secured Party at a place to be designated by the Secured Party that is
reasonably convenient to both parties, or (B) without notice except as specified
below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public
or private sale, at any of the Secured Party's offices or elsewhere, for cash,
on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Secured Party
may deem commercially reasonable. The Debtor agrees that, to the extent notice
of sale shall be required by law, at least thirty (30) days' notice to the
Debtor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any
private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Secured
Party shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice
of sale having been given. The Secured Party may adjourn any public or private
sale from time to time


                                       12
<PAGE>

by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned;

            (c) hold any money held by the Secured Party as Collateral and all
cash proceeds received by the Secured Party in respect of any sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral, as
collateral for, and/or, then, or at any time thereafter, apply such amounts, in
whole or in part, against all or any part of the Obligations, and to make any
currency conversions or effect any transaction in currencies which it thinks
fit, and to do so at such times and rates as it thinks proper; and

            (d) exercise any and all rights and remedies of the Debtor under or
in respect of the Collateral.

            Section 6.02 Waiver of Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Debtor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by all Requirements
of Law:

            (a) all damages occasioned by taking of possession except any
damages which are the direct result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Secured Party or any Person acting on its behalf or
instruction;

            (b) all other requirements as to the time, place and terms of sale
or other requirements with respect to the enforcement of the Secured Party's
rights hereunder; and

            (c) all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay,
extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any Requirement of Law
in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, any right to claim that such enforcement should be stayed
pending the outcome of any other action or proceeding (including any arbitration
proceeding)) or the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof, and
the Debtor, for itself and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or they now
or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all such Requirements of
Law.

            Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other
realization upon, any Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title,
interest, claim and demand, either at law or in equity, of the Debtor therein
and thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against the
Debtor and against any and all Persons claiming or attempting to claim the
Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof, from,
through and under the Debtor.

            Section 6.03 Deficiencies and Excess Proceeds. The Secured Party
shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the Debtor any proceeds and
Collateral remaining after exercising remedies under Section 6.01 and after
satisfaction in full of all amounts payable by the Debtor with respect to any
Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the Debtor shall
remain liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of the proceeds
of the Collateral and the aggregate amount of the Obligations.

            Section 6.04 Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of
the Secured Party, in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder and no
course of dealing between the Debtor and the Secured Party shall operate as a
waiver hereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further


                                       13
<PAGE>

exercise hereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder. The rights, powers and remedies herein expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the Secured
Party would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the Debtor in any case
shall entitle the Debtor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Secured Party to
any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

            Section 6.05 Discontinuance of Proceedings. In case the Secured
Party shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy
under this Agreement by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such
proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall
have been determined adversely to the Secured Party, then and in every such case
the Debtor, the Secured Party shall be restored to their former positions and
rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral subject to the security interest
created under this Agreement, and all rights, remedies and powers of the
Secured Party shall continue as if no such proceeding had been instituted.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

            Section 7.01 Expenses.

            (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.01(b) and
7.01(c), each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including any stamp,
transfer or similar transaction tax or duty payable on any transfer it is
required to make under this Agreement) in connection with performing its
obligations under this Agreement and neither party will be liable for any such
costs and expenses incurred by the other party.

            (b) The Debtor shall promptly pay when due all taxes, assessments or
charges of any nature that are imposed with respect to Collateral upon becoming
aware of the same.

            (c) All reasonable costs, expenses, charges and fees paid or
incurred by the Secured Party in the exercise of any of the rights, remedies or
powers granted hereunder shall be for the account of the Debtor, and the Debtor
undertakes promptly on demand to pay the same or, as the case may be, to
reimburse the Secured Party and/or its agents, representatives, successors and
assigns as the case may be, for any monies paid by it with interest thereon to
the extent that there are then insufficient funds available in the Collateral
Accounts for this purpose.

This Agreement is a contract made under the laws of The Commonwealth of

legal action or proceeding against the Debtor with respect to this Agreement may
be brought in the courts of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the County of
Suffolk, or in the federal courts of the United States for the District of
Massachusetts, it being understood that nothing herein shall affect the right of
the Secured Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Debtor in any
jurisdiction, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Debtor
hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The Debtor agrees
that a judgment, after exhaustion of all available appeals, in any such action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding upon the Debtor, and may be
enforced in any jurisdiction, by a suit upon such judgment, a certified copy of
which shall be conclusive evidence of the judgment.

            (b) The Debtor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement brought in the
courts referred to in clause (a) above and hereby further irrevocably waives and

proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

the earlier of (i) the irrevocable payment and performance in full or
termination or waiver of the Obligations (other than contingent surviving

Party, or (ii) such time as the Debtor delivers a notice to the Secured Party
and the Custodian that the Ending Reserves so reported by the Debtor do not
exceed USD 100 million as of two consecutive calendar years ends, provided,
however, that no Relevant Event shall have occurred and be continuing. Upon such
termination, the Secured Party shall, at the Debtor's expense, execute and
deliver to the Debtor such documents, and take such other acts, as the Debtor
shall reasonably request to evidence, or give effect to, such termination.

            Section 7.11 Reinstatement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, this Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as
the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the
Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization of the Debtor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the
Debtor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such
payments had not been made.

            Section 7.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
and both of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

            Section 7.13 Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
