Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire

unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall
comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to
Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to
                                                         ------- --------

Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender
of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted
to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative
Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that
shall have made their payments pursuant to this

30 days prior to the then-applicable expiration date that such Letter of Credit
will not be renewed.

          (d)  Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
               --------------
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the

<PAGE>

foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this
Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower
for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. All payments with
respect to an LC Disbursement made pursuant to this paragraph shall be made in
Dollars.

          (e)  Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
               --------------
in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt, provided that
                                                                 --------
the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed
with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and,
to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall
be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline
Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative
Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment
then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable
Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then
due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with
respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis
                                                                    -------
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative
--------
Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from
the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders
have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank,
then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any
payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a
Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. All
payments with respect to an LC Disbursement made pursuant to this paragraph
shall be made in Dollars.

          (f)  Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
               ---------------------
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this

                                       26
<PAGE>

Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of(i) any
lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or
any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under
a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment
by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or
(iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute
a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders
nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability
or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of
any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder
(irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission
or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any
Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank, provided that the foregoing shall
                                               --------
not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to
the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties
hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful
misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care
in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting
the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the
terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion,
either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are
not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (g)  Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
               ------------------------
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder, provided that any failure to give or
                                         --------
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

          (h)  Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
               -----------------
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans,
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
--------
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the


<PAGE>

Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing
Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

          (i)  Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced
               --------------------------------
at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At
the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all
unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

          (j)  Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
               -----------------------
be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of
the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this
paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative
Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the
Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, provided that the obligation to deposit
                                     --------
such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Each such deposit pursuant to
this paragraph or Section 2.10(b) shall be held by the Administrative Agent as
collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower
under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other
than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments
shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and
at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.
Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such
account and shall be the Borrower's property held by the Collateral Agent for
the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC
Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but
subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than
50% of the total LC Exposure), shall be applied to satisfy other obligations of
the Borrower under this Agreement. Moneys in such account shall be applied by
the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for
which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be
held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for
the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of

<PAGE>

the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount plus any accrued interest or
realized profits on account of such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after
all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b), such
amount plus any accrued interest or realized profits on account of such amount
(to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower as
and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the Borrower would
remain in compliance with Section 2.10(b) and no Default shall have occurred and
be continuing.

          SECTION 2.06.  Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
                         ----------------------
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders, provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided
                       --------
in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request,
provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
--------
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

          (b)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.07.  Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing
                         -------------------
initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest
Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may
elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such
Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different
options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which
case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the
Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion
shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to
Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

<PAGE>

                  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower
were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election
to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

                  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and
paragraph (f) of this Section:

               (i)   the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
         applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
         different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
         each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
         pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
         resulting Borrowing);

               (ii)  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
         Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

               (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing
         or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

               (iv)  if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
         Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
         election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
         term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long
as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be
converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

                  SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)
                                -----------------------------------------
Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity
Date.
<PAGE>

                  (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Commitments, provided that (i) each reduction of the
                              --------
Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and
not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the
Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in
accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Exposures would exceed the total
Commitments.

                  (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section, or any required reduction of the Commitments under paragraph (d) of
this Section, at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable, provided that a notice
                                                        --------
of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied.

                  (d) Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be
permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

                  SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The
                                ------------------------------------
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan of
such Lender on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then
unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the Maturity Date, provided
                                                                     --------
that (A) on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made and (B) if requested
by the Swingline Lender, on the last day of March, June, September and December
of each year, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.

                  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

                 (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which
it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

                 (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
                                              ----- -----
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein, provided that the
                                                           --------
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
<PAGE>

                  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it
be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

                  SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have
                                --------------------
the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or
in part, without penalty, subject to the requirements of this Section and
Section 2.15.

                  (b) In the event that and on each occasion on which the total
Exposure exceeds the total Commitments, the Borrower shall prepay Revolving
Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding,
deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

                  (c) In the event that and on the occasion on which the
Borrower issues or incurs Subordinated Debt, the Borrower shall, upon such
issuance or incurrence, prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the net
proceeds of such Subordinated Debt.

                  (d) Not more than three Business Days after the occurrence of
a Prepayment Event, the Borrower or its Subsidiary shall prepay Revolving Loans
(with a corresponding reduction of the Commitments) in an amount equal to the
Net Proceeds of such Prepayment Event.

                  (e) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of
Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to
be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section.

                  (f) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and,
in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment, provided that, if a
                                                       --------
notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice
of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such
notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice
(other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment
of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of
<PAGE>

an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except
as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.12.

                  SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
                                -----
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which
shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of the
Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued
commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments
terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date.
All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, a
Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the
outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline
Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as interest on Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment
terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and
(ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25%
per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion
thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC
Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing
of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and
including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall
be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the Closing Date, provided that all such fees
                                                 --------
shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such
fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable
on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph
shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and
fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

                 (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed
upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                 (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due,
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation
<PAGE>

fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under
any circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR
                                ---------
Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate
Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of
any Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in
the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other
amount, 2.00% plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section.

                  (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the
Commitments, provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of
             --------
this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end
of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii)
in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable
on the effective date of such conversion.

                 (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO0 Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                 SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
                               --------------------------
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                 (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
         shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable
         means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIB0 Rate for such
         Interest Period; or

                 (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders
         that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not
         adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
         maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest
         Period;
<PAGE>

         then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower
         and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
         thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower
         and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
         longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the
         conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a
         Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing
         Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made
         as an ABR Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
                                ----------------

                (i)  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
         the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
         reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing
         Bank; or

                (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London
         interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
         Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
         participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such
Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's
or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                 (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth
the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or
its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

                 (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such
<PAGE>

Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation, provided that
                                                                  --------
the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more
than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
                                          -------- -------
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

                  SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
                                -----------------------
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.10(d) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender
for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIB0 Rate that would have been
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

                  SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account
                                ------
of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any
                --------
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

                 (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
<PAGE>

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender
has received written notice from the Borrower advising it of the availability of
such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.

                  SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing
                                -----------------------------------------------
of Setoffs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
-----------
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14,
2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or
under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time), on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to
the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any
such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under
any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case
<PAGE>

of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in
Dollars.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or
Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater
proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of
other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments
shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, provided that (i) if any
                                                        --------
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or
participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions
of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and
agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may
exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.
<PAGE>

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or
9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                  SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
                                ----------------------------------------------
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that (i) the Borrower
                                              --------
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and
Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a
claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a material reduction in
such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                        ------------------------------

                   The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders and the
Issuing Bank that:

                   SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower
                                 --------------------
and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every
jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

                   SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions
                                 -----------------------------
to be entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate
powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if
required, stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which
any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party,
will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower or such
Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

                   SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The
                                 ------------------------------------
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by or before, any Governmental Authority,
except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and
except filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents, (b)
will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the terms of the charter,
by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or
result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding
upon the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their assets, or give
rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Borrower or
any of the Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, except
Liens created under the Loan Documents.

                   SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse
                                 ----------------------------------------
Change. (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
------
consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders' equity and
cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1999, reported on
by independent public accountants, (ii) as of and for each fiscal quarter after
October 31, 1999, and ended 30 days before the Closing Date, certified by its
chief financial officer and (iii) each fiscal month after the most recent 2000
fiscal quarter for which financial statements were received by the Lenders as
described above and ended 30 days before the Closing Date, certified by its
chief financial officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash
flows of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for
such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to
<PAGE>

year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the
statements referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) above.

                  (b) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of the Closing Date, prepared giving
effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on such date.
Such pro forma consolidated balance sheet (i) has been prepared in good faith
based on the same assumptions used to prepare the pro forma financial statements
included in the Information Memorandum (which assumptions are believed by the

                                -----------------------------------
Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property,

Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all

of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts,
exceed by more than $5,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan,
and the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded
Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent

statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $5,000,000 the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

                  SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the
                                ----------
Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which
the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known
to any of them that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information
Memorandum any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other
information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or
supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, provided that, with respect to projected financial
                      --------

good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

                                ------------
of, and the ownership interest of the Borrower in, each Subsidiary and
identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each case as of
the Closing Date. The ownership interests so indicated on Schedule 3.12 are
fully paid and non-assessable and are owned, as of the Closing Date, by the
Borrower.

                  SECTION 3.13. Insurance. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a
                                ---------
description of all insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, all premiums in

insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is
adequate.

                  SECTION 3.14. Labor Matters. As of the Closing Date, there are
                                -------------
no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending
or, to the knowledge of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, threatened. The hours
worked by and payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries
have not been in violation in any material respect of the Fair Labor Standards
Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with
such matters. All payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which
any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of
wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.
The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of
termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any
collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is
bound.

                  SECTION 3.15. Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of
                                --------
the Transactions to occur on the Closing Date, (a) the fair value of the assets
of each Loan Party, at a fair valuation, will exceed its debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of
the property of each Loan Party will be greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party will be able to pay its debts
and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become
<PAGE>

absolute and matured; and (d) each Loan Party will not have unreasonably small
capital with which to conduct the business in which it is engaged as such
business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Closing
Date.

                  SECTION 3.16. Senior Indebtedness. To the extent any
                                -------------------
Subordinated Debt is outstanding, the Obligations constitute "Senior
Indebtedness" under and as defined in the Subordinated Debt Documents.

Agreement)), in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other
than with respect to Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02.

                  (c) When the Security Agreement (or a summary thereof) is
filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States
Copyright Office, the Security Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien
on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties
in the Intellectual Property (as defined in the Security Agreement) in which a
security interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registering a
security agreement, financing statement or analogous document in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office, as
applicable, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person (it
being understood that subsequent recordings in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office may be necessary to
perfect a lien on registered trademarks, trademark applications and copyrights
acquired by the Loan Parties after the Closing Date), other than with respect to
Liens permitted by Section 6.02.

                  (d) The Mortgages are effective to create, subject to the

          (g)  any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
     Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables
     or permits (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or
     both) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness (or any portion of
     the principal amount thereof) or any
<PAGE>

     effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian,

described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the
request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take either or
both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)
declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part,
in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter
be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any
event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this
Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the
Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                           The Administrative Agent
                           ------------------------

          Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. For purposes of this
Article VIII and for the purposes of Article IX, all references to the
Administrative Agent are deemed to include the Collateral Agent.

          The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the
<PAGE>

foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under
the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set
forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information
relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or
obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under
the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own
gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed
not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain
or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report
or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

          The Administrative Agent may perform any of and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
<PAGE>

have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative
Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent that shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York,
or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the
Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable
to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make
its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.

          The Lenders identified in this Agreement as the Documentation Agent
and the Syndication Agent shall not have any right, power, obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those
applicable to all Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the
Documentation Agent nor the Syndication Agent shall have or be deemed to have a
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same
acknowledgments with respect to the Documentation Agent and the Syndication
Agent as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender
in this Article VIII.

                                  ARTICLE IX

                                 Miscellaneous

          SECTION 9.02.  Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
                         -------------------
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by
any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall
be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

          (b)  Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders, provided
                                                                        --------
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or the required date of reimbursement
of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees
payable hereunder, or
<PAGE>

postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a
manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby,
without the written consent of each Lender, (v) increase the aggregate amount of
the Lenders Commitments or incur any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on
any assets or property subject to the Security Documents, in each case without
the written consent of Lenders having Exposures and unused Commitments

Commitments at such time, (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or
the percentage set forth in the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any

Lenders or Lenders of any Class required to waive, amend or modify any rights
thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without
the written consent of each Lender, (vii) release any material Subsidiary Loan
Party from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement, or limit its liability
in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender or
(viii) release a substantial portion of the Collateral from the Liens of the
Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender (except as
expressly provided in such Security Documents); provided, further that (A) no
                                                -----------------
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

          SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower
                         ----------------------------------
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent and their
respective Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements
of counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the
Documentation Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities
provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents or
any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or
not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii)
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection
with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred

Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or
protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its
rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of
Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred
during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or
Letters of Credit.

          (b)  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender,
and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being
called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and
           ----------
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or
any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the
parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations
<PAGE>

 thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
 contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
 proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand
 for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
 with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
 Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence, Release or threatened Release of
 Hazardous Materials on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property
 currently or formerly owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the
 Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower
 or any of the Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim,
 litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
 whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether
 any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as
                                    --------
 to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
 damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
 jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the
 gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

          (c)  To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required
 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the
 Documentation Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph
 (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
 Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, the
 Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro
 rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense
 or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the
                                                        --------
 unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
 expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
 Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, the
 Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes
 hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of
 the sum of the total Exposures and unused Commitments at the time.

          (d)  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not
 assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
 liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
 to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
 of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
 Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
 In addition, no Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use
 by others of information or other materials obtained through electronic,
 telecommunications or other information transmission systems.

          (e)  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later
 than five days after written demand therefor.

          SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
                        ----------------------
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing
<PAGE>

 Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly
 contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent,
 the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
 under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (b)  Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
 of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
 of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it), provided that (i)
                                                           --------
 except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or Lender Affiliate, each of
 the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline
 Lender must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent
 shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of an assignment
 to a Lender or Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount
 of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or
 Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of
 the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
 delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless
 each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each
 partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of
 all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv)
 the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
 Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation
 fee of $3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
 to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided
                                                                  --------
 further that any consent of the Borrower otherwise required under this
 -------
 paragraph shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing.
 Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
 Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
 Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
 of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
 obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender
 thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
 Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
 case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
 rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
 party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
 obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
 be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
 participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e)
 of this Section.

          (c)  The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
 the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
 copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
 recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
 and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
 pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
                                                      --------
 the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
 the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded
 in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
 purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
 Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank
 and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
 prior notice.
<PAGE>

          (d)  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
 executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
 Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
 hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
 this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
 (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
 Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
 assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
 recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

          (e)  Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
 Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell
 participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
                                                           -----------
 or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
 (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it),
 provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
 --------
 unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
 parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower,
 the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue
 to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
 rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
 pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
                                                             -------
 Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve
 any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents,
 provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
 --------
 not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
 modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that
 affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the
 Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
 Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
 acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
 To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
 benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
 agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.

          (f)  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
 payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been
 entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
 unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
 Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
 if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16
 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant
 and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
 Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

          (g)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
 in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
 of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
 Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
 assignment of a security interest, provided that no such pledge or assignment
                                    --------
 of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
 hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
 hereto.

          (h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
 Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an
            ---------------
 "SPV"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender
  ---
 to the
<PAGE>

 Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower
 all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be
 obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, provided that (i)
                                                               --------
 nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan and
 (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
 all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make
 such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPV
 hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same
 extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party
 hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
 payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain
 with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
 hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
 that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
 of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it
 will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against,
 such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
 proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In
 addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.04, any
 SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the
 Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee
 therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting
 Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and the
 Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
 account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii)
 disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
 Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
 guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV. As this Section
 9.04(h) applies to any particular SPV, this Section may not be amended without
 the written consent of such SPV.

          SECTION 9.05.  Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations
                         --------
 and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
 certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
 this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
 relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
 delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
 Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
 or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
 Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
 representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
 shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
 accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
 Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
 so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of
 Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in
 full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
 contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination
 of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
 Agreement or any provision hereof

          SECTION 9.06.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
                         -----------------------------------------
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the commitment letter and fee letter heretofore
entered into with the Administrative Agent relating to the facilities
contemplated by this Agreement and any separate letter
<PAGE>

agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute
the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written,
relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.07.  Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to
                         -------------
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.08.  Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
                         ----------------
occurred and be continuing each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

          SECTION 9.09.  GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF
                         --------------------------------------------------

          (b)  The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any
Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring
any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
against the Borrower or their properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
<PAGE>

          (c)  The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

          (d)  Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

          SECTION 9.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
                         ---------------------
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

          SECTION 9.11.  Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
                         ---------
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.12.  Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
                         ----------------
Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section,
to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with
the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii)
becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the
Documentation Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a
<PAGE>

source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, the term
"Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the
 -----------
Borrower or its businesses, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the
Borrower, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower
          --------
after the Closing Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.

          SECTION 9.13.  Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
                         -------------------------
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
                                                     -------
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged,
                          ------------
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

          SECTION 9.14.  Effectiveness of the Amendment and Restatement;
                         ----------------------------------------------
Original Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective on the
-------------------------
Effective Date, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Until this
Agreement becomes effective, the Original Credit Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected hereby. After the Effective Date, all
obligations of the Borrower under the Original Credit Agreement shall become
obligations of the Borrower hereunder, secured by the Liens granted under the
Security Documents, and the provisions of the Original Credit Agreement shall be
superseded by the provisions hereof. Except as otherwise expressly stated
hereunder, the term of this Agreement is for all purposes deemed to have
commenced on the Effective Date.
