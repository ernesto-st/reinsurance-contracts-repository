                          REINSURANCE POOLING AGREEMENT
                   AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2000


This Fifth Amendment (the "Fifth Amendment") to the Reinsurance Pooling
Agreement Amended and Restated as of January 1, 2000, as heretofore amended (the
"2000 Pooling Agreement"), by and among State Automobile Mutual Insurance
Company ("State Auto Mutual"), State Auto Property and Casualty Insurance
Company ("State Auto P&C"), Milbank Insurance Company ("Milbank"), State Auto
Insurance Company of Wisconsin ("State Auto Wisconsin"), Farmers Casualty
Insurance Company ("Farmers Casualty"), State Auto Insurance Company of Ohio
("State Auto Ohio") and State Auto Florida Insurance Company ("State Auto
Florida") (collectively, the "Pooled Companies") is made this 8th day of
July 2004, but is effective as of 12:01 a.m. Columbus, Ohio time July 1, 2004.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
----------------------

The State Auto Group of insurance companies ("State Auto") intends to expand the
scope of its commercial insurance operations by offering customers State Auto
Middle Market Insurance (as defined below).

State Auto believes that State Auto Middle Market Insurance is an important
opportunity to increase its penetration in commercial lines and to form closer
ties with its independent insurance agents who distribute State Auto's other
products.

State Auto desires for agents to place State Auto Middle Market Insurance with
Meridian Security Insurance Company ("Meridian Security"), an Indiana domiciled
property casualty insurer which is a wholly owned subsidiary of State Auto
Mutual.

On an interim basis, such coverage shall be placed in State Auto Mutual because
it currently holds the requisite state licenses and rate/form filings, while
Meridian Security is in the process of securing these regulatory approvals.
Placing business with State Auto Mutual will allow earlier entry into this
important market segment.

For the interim period that State Auto Middle Market Insurance is to be written
through State Auto Mutual, said insurance would be subject to the 2000 Pooling
Agreement unless specifically excluded therefrom. State Auto does not intend for
State Auto Middle Market Insurance to be subject to the 2000 Pooling Agreement;
therefore, the 2000 Pooling Agreement needs to be amended to exclude State Auto
Middle Market Insurance.

The Independent Committee of the Board of Directors of each of State Auto Mutual
and State Auto Financial Corporation has approved the exclusion of State Auto
Middle Market Insurance from the 2000 Pooling Agreement.

The purpose of the Fifth Amendment is to exclude State Auto Middle Market
Insurance from the 2000 Pooling Agreement from and after the effective date
hereof.
