interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to

time entered into among the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender
shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the
same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Office specified in a
notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.

         2.9      Notes; Evidence of Indebtedness.

                  (a)      Each Lender's Loans shall be evidenced by a Note
executed and delivered by Borrower on the Effective Date to such Lender in the
form of Exhibit B. If a Lender assigns a


                                       37
<PAGE>

part (but less than all) of its Note or Notes, Borrower shall, upon request,
execute and deliver new Notes to the respective owners of the original note that
aggregate the amount of the original Note or Notes, as directed jointly by the
assignor and assignee, and upon delivery of the new Note or Notes, the original
Note shall be endorsed to state that it has been replaced by such new Note or
Notes.

                  (b)      Each Lender is hereby authorized to maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts
in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type
thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower
to each Lender hereunder, and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder from Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries maintained in the accounts maintained
pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence, absent
manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein
recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner
affect the obligation of Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with
their terms.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
above or elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to the
Lenders which at any time specifically request the delivery of such Notes. No
failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans shall
affect or in any manner impair the obligations of Borrower to pay the Loans (and
all related Obligations) which would otherwise be evidenced thereby in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and shall not in any way
affect the guaranties therefor provided pursuant to the various Loan Documents.
At any time when any Lender requests the delivery of a Note to evidence its
Loans, Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender the
requested Note or Notes in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such
Loans.

         2.10     Telephonic Notices. Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Loans, effect selections
of Types of Loans and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any
person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes
to be an Authorized Officer acting on behalf of Borrower, it being understood
that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing
Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically. Borrower
agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation,
if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of
each telephonic notice, signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written
confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.


                                       38
<PAGE>

         2.11     Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest
accrued on each Floating Rate Loan shall be payable on each Quarterly Payment
Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, on
any date on which the Floating Rate Loan is prepaid, whether due to acceleration
or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the
outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Loan converted into a LIBO
Rate Loan on a day other than a Quarterly Payment Date shall be payable on the
date of conversion. Interest accrued on each LIBO Rate Loan shall be payable on
the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the LIBO
Rate Loan is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.
Interest and commitment fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the
basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day a Loan is made
but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received
prior to 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) at the place of payment. If any payment of
principal of or interest on a Loan shall become due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day
and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be
included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

         2.12     Notification of Loans, Interest Rates and Prepayments.
Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender
of the contents of each Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and
repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify
each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each LIBO Rate Loan promptly upon
determination of such interest rate.

         2.13     Lending Offices. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending
Office selected by such Lender, and may change its Lending Office from time to
time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Office and the
Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the
benefit of any such Lending Office. Each Lender may, by written notice to the
Administrative Agent and Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate
replacement or additional Lending Offices through which Loans will be made by it
and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.

         2.14     Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless
Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent
prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative
Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case
of Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.
The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of
such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption. If such Lender or Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made
such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall,
on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the
amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day
during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by
the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.


                                       39
<PAGE>

         2.15     Replacement of Lender. If Borrower is required pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Loans into,
LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender so
affected an "Affected Lender"), Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to
be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such Affected
Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided further
that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which
is reasonably satisfactory to Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree,
as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the
Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit F
and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all
obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to
comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii)
Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such
replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to
such Affected Lender by Borrower hereunder to and including the date of
termination, including without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender
under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment
which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under
Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date
rather than sold to the replacement Lender.

                                   ARTICLE III

                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

         3.1      Yield Protection. If, on or after the Effective Date, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Office with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

                           (i)      subjects any Lender or any applicable
Lending Office to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other
than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its LIBO Rate
Loans, or

                           (ii)     imposes or increases or deems applicable any
reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
any Lender or any applicable Lending Office (other than reserves and assessments
taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to LIBO Rate
Loans), or

                           (iii)    imposes any other condition the result of
which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Office of
making, funding or maintaining its LIBO Rate Loans, or reduces any amount
receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Office in connection with its
LIBO Rate Loans or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Office


                                       40
<PAGE>

to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of LIBO Rate Loans
held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Office of making or maintaining its LIBO Rate Loans or to
reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Office in
connection with such LIBO Rate Loans, then, within 15 days of demand by such
Lender, Borrower shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.

         3.2      Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender
determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender, any Lending Office of such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below in this Section
3.2), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, Borrower shall pay such
Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of
return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is
attributable to this Agreement or its Outstanding Credit Exposure (after taking
into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i)
any change after the Effective Date in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii)
any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) after the Effective Date which affects the amount
of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending
Office or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital
Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United
States on the Effective Date, including transition rules, and (ii) the
corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside
the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on
Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence
of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and
any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the Effective Date.

         3.3      Availability of Types of Loans. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its LIBO Rate Loans at a suitable Lending Office would violate
any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the
force of law, or if the Majority Lenders determine that by reason of changes
affecting the interbank LIBO Rate market, (i) deposits of a type and maturity
appropriate to match fund LIBO Rate Loans are not available or (ii) the interest
rate applicable to LIBO Rate Loans does not accurately reflect the cost of
making or maintaining LIBO Rate Loans, then the Administrative Agent shall
suspend the availability of LIBO Rate Loans until the first date on which the
circumstances causing such suspension cease to exist and require any affected
LIBO Rate Loans to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate Loans, subject to the
payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.

         3.4      Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a LIBO Rate Loan
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a LIBO Rate Loan is
not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default
by the Lenders, Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost
incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or
cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such LIBO
Rate Loan,


                                       41
<PAGE>

provided that such indemnity shall not apply to any such loss or cost incurred
solely by reason of an adjustment to any Interest Period made by the
Administrative Agent in connection with syndicating the Loans.

         3.5      Taxes.   (i) All payments by Borrower to or for the account of
any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If Borrower shall
be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (a) the sum payable shall
be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
3.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(b) Borrower shall make such deductions, (c) Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d)
Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

                           (ii)     In addition, Borrower hereby agrees to pay
any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
hereunder or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise
with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").

                           (iii)    Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts
payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender
and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto. Payments due under this indemnification shall be made
within 30 days of the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand
therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

                           (iv)     Each Lender that is not incorporated under
the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S.
Lender") agrees that it will, not less than ten Business Days after the
Effective Date (or such later date upon which it becomes a Lender hereunder),
deliver to each of Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed
copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI,
certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, or backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes
to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (x) renewals or
additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date
that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any
event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such
additional forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by
Borrower or the Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments described in the
preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any
change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any
such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and
delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender


                                       42
<PAGE>

advises Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax.

                           (v)      For any period during which a Non-U.S.
Lender has failed to provide Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to
clause (iv) above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or
regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form
originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be
entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed
by the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise
exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to
Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv),
above, Borrower shall take such steps (but without material expense to Borrower)
as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender
to recover such Taxes.

                           (vi)     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
Agreement or any Notes pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any
treaty shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at
the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments
to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

                           (vii)    If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any
other governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any
political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
(because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because
such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for
any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and
Borrower fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be, as tax, withholding
therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or
Borrower under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related
thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the
Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be, which attorneys may be
employees of the Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be). The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment
of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.6      Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent
reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Office
with respect to its LIBO Rate Loans to reduce any liability of Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of LIBO
Rate Loans under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the
judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
Determination of


                                       43
<PAGE>

amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a LIBO Rate Loan shall be
calculated as though each Lender funded its LIBO Rate Loan through the purchase
of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a
reference in determining the LIBO Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact
that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified
in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt
by Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of Borrower under
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and
termination of this Agreement.

         3.7      Reasonable Efforts to Mitigate. Each Lender shall use its
reasonable best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and
regulatory restrictions) to minimize any amounts payable by Borrower under
Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 and to minimize any period of illegality under
Section 3.3. Each Lender further agrees to notify Borrower promptly, but in any
event within 30 Business Days, after such Lender learns of the circumstances
giving rise to such a right of payment or such illegality or any circumstances
that have changed such that such right to payment or such illegality, as the
case may be, no longer exists.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Borrower and Parent Guarantor represents and warrants to the Lenders
that, as of the Effective Date, and thereafter whenever the representations and
warranties under this Article V are updated, remade or deemed to be remade:

         5.1      Ownership, Existence and Standing. Borrower, Parent Guarantor,
each Resort Owner and each Subsidiary Guarantor is a corporation, limited
partnership or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or
organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept
applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted. True, correct
and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor, each Resort Owner and each Subsidiary Guarantor have been delivered
to the Administrative Agent, each of which is in full force and effect, has not
been modified or amended except to the extent set forth therein and there are no
defaults under such Organizational Documents and, to the best of Borrower's and
Parent Guarantor's knowledge, no events exist which, with the passage of time or
giving of notice or both, would constitute a default under such Organizational
Documents. As of the date hereof, the ownership structure of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor, each Resort Owner and Subsidiary Guarantors, and all direct and
indirect owners of membership interests therein are completely and accurately
disclosed on the ownership chart attached as Schedule 5.1. Borrower is not a
"foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

         5.2      Authorization and Validity. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and
each Subsidiary Guarantor has the power and authority and legal right to execute
and deliver the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform its
obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by Borrower, Parent Guarantor
or any Subsidiary Guarantor of the Loan Documents to


                                       49
<PAGE>

which it is a party and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been
duly authorized by proper corporate or company proceedings. Each of the Loan
Documents to which Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a
party (A) has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor or Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, (B) to the extent the
same constitutes a security agreement or a collateral document, creates valid
first Liens in the Collateral covered thereby, securing the payment of all of
the Secured Obligations purported to be secured thereby, (C) assuming due
authorization and execution by the Lenders party thereto, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or Subsidiary
Guarantors, as the case may be, enforceable against such Person, in accordance
with its terms except to the extent that the enforcement thereof or the
availability of equitable remedies may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar laws now
or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or
by general principles of equity, or by the discretion of any court of competent
jurisdiction in awarding equitable remedies, regardless of whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and (D) is in full
force and effect. All the terms, provisions, agreements and conditions set forth
in the Loan Documents and required to be performed or complied with by Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or Subsidiary Guarantors have been performed or complied with
and no Default or breach of any covenant by any such Person exists thereunder.

         5.3      No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors of the Loan
Documents to which any of them is a party, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on any such Person or (ii) such Person's articles or
certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership,
articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or limited liability company
operating agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any
indenture, instrument or agreement to which such Person is a party or is
subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the property of such Person pursuant to the
terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent,
adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing,
recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of
any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which
has not been obtained by Borrower, Parent Guarantor or Subsidiary Guarantors, is
required to be obtained by any of them in connection with the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under this Agreement, the payment
and performance by Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors of the
Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
of the Loan Documents.

         5.4      Financial Statements and Projections. The historical financial
statements of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors heretofore
delivered to the Lenders (a) in the case of Parent Guarantor, were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect on the date
such statements were prepared and (b) in the case of Borrower and the Subsidiary
Guarantors, were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for presentation on a stand-alone basis, but were prepared in a
manner customary for division reporting into a consolidated group in effect on
the date such statements


                                       50
<PAGE>

were prepared. All of the historical financial statements referred to in the
preceding sentence fairly present the financial condition and operations of
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, at
such date and the results of its operations for the period then ended. Since
December 31, 2002 and through the Effective Date, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, operations, property or condition (financial or
otherwise) of Parent Guarantor's Subsidiaries (other than Florida Resort Owner
or Texas Resort Owner) taken as a whole or Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, or either of the Resort Owners. All financial projections with
respect to either Resort Owner, Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary
Guarantors heretofore delivered to Lenders, including, without limitation,
financial projections for the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project represent
reasonable estimates of future performance and financial condition, subject to
uncertainties and approximations inherent in the making of any financial
projections and without assurance that the projected performance and financial
condition actually will be achieved.

         5.5      Pledge of Equity Interests In Resort Owners. (a) Upon delivery
to the Administrative Agent of any certificated interests pledged pursuant to
the Pledge Agreements (together with applicable transfer powers) and upon the
taking of all actions required by the Uniform Commercial Code in the case of any
uncertificated interests pursuant to the Pledge Agreements (which delivery
and/or such other actions have been done and remain in full force and effect as
to all Collateral on any date on which this representation and warranty is made
or deemed made), the security interests created in favor of the Administrative
Agent, as pledgee, for the benefit of the Lenders under the Pledge Agreements
constitute a first priority perfected security interest in the Collateral
described therein, subject to no other security interests of any other Person.
No filings or recordings (other than those specified in Section 5.5(b)) are
required in order to perfect (or maintain the perfection or priority of) the
security interests created in the Collateral and the proceeds thereof under the
Pledge Agreements.

                  (b)      The Pledge Agreements are effective to create in
favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a
legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral and, when the
Uniform Commercial Code financing statements are filed in the offices specified
on Schedule 5.5(b), the Pledge Agreements shall constitute a fully perfected
first priority Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest
of the pledgors thereunder in the Collateral as therein defined, in each case
prior and superior in right to any other Person.

         5.6      Taxes. Borrower, Parent Guarantor, each of the Resort Owners
and Subsidiary Guarantors have filed all United States federal tax returns and
all other tax returns which are required to be filed and for which the due date
(including extensions) has occurred and has paid all taxes due and payable
pursuant to said returns. All taxes (including real estate taxes), assessments,
fees and other charges of Governmental Authorities upon or relating to
Borrower's, Parent Guarantor's, either Resort Owner's or any Subsidiary
Guarantor's assets (including the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project),
receipts, sales, use, payroll, employment, income, licenses and franchises which
are due and payable have been paid, except to the extent such taxes,
assessments, fees and other charges of Governmental Authorities are being
contested in good faith by an appropriate proceeding diligently pursued with the
security delivered as and to the extent required by the terms of Section 6.5.
Borrower has no knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against either Resort
Owner, Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary


                                       51
<PAGE>

Guarantor, or the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project that will have or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No tax liens have been
filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes. Each
Resort Owner qualifies for partnership pass-through entity treatment under
United States federal tax law.

         5.7      Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as otherwise
described on Schedule 5.7, there is, as of the date hereof, no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened (a) against or affecting
either Resort Owner, Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor or
other Subsidiary of Parent Guarantor or any of their respective Properties or
(b) which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the completion or operation of the
Project or the making of any Loans. Except as otherwise described on Schedule
5.7, none of the Resort Owners, Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Subsidiary
Guarantors or other Subsidiaries of Parent Guarantor has any material Contingent
Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred
to in Section 5.4.

         5.8      Subsidiaries. (a) As of the date hereof, Parent Guarantor has
no Subsidiaries other than as shown on the ownership chart attached hereto as
Schedule 5.1. The percentage numbers shown on the chart attached hereto as
Schedule 5.1 indicate the percentage of Parent Guarantor's ownership in entities
in which Parent Guarantor owns, directly or indirectly, less than one hundred
percent of all ownership interests. The absence of a percentage number with
respect to an entity shown on Schedule 5.1 indicates that Parent Guarantor owns,
directly or indirectly, one hundred percent of all ownership interests in such
entity. The state or country of formation of each entity on such chart is
correctly shown thereon.

                  (b)      Country Music Television International, Inc. is a
defunct or "shell" company with no material assets.

                  (c)      Oklahoma City Athletic Club, Inc. is an indirect
Subsidiary of Parent Guarantor that is a party to franchise agreements with
major league baseball and the Pacific Coast Baseball League, both of which
prohibit incurring contingent obligations on behalf of affiliates or
subsidiaries for debt that is not directly related to baseball operations.

         5.9      Affiliate Contracts. Other than as disclosed on Schedule 5.9,
there are no material contracts or other agreements between either Resort Owner,
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and any Affiliate of such parties in effect with
respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida, the Project or any part thereof.

         5.10     Accuracy of Information. No written or documentary
information, exhibit or report furnished by or on behalf of either Resort Owner,
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors to the Administrative Agent
or to any Lender in connection with the syndication of the Commitments and the
Loans, or the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan Documents, contained
any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact or any
fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

         5.11     Margin Regulations. No part of the proceeds of the Loans will
be used to purchase or carry any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) or to
extend credit for the


                                       52
<PAGE>

purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock. Neither the making of the
Loans nor the use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent with
the provisions of Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X.

         5.12     Material Agreements. Neither Resort Owner, Borrower, Parent
Guarantor nor any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party to any agreement or instrument
or subject to any charter or other corporate or company restriction which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Resort Owner,
Borrower, Parent Guarantor nor any Subsidiary Guarantor is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any material obligation, covenant or
condition contained in (i) any Project Agreement, (ii) any other agreement to
which it is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or (iii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or
governing Indebtedness.

         5.13     Compliance With Laws. Except where any failure to comply would
not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, property,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any of them, each Resort
Owner, Borrower, Parent Guarantor and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
agency thereof having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
businesses or the ownership of their respective Property, and except as
otherwise described on Schedule 5.13, neither Resort Owner, Borrower, Parent
Guarantor nor any of Parent Guarantor's Subsidiaries nor the Opryland Hotel
Florida nor the Project is subject to or in default with respect to any final
judgment, writ, injunction, restraining order or order of any nature, decree,
rule or regulation of any court or Governmental Authority.

         5.14     Ownership of Certain Properties. (a) Borrower owns, directly
or indirectly 100% of all ownership interests in each of the Resort Owners. Each
Resort Owner has good, insurable (at normal rates) leasehold title to the
Opryland Hotel Florida and fee and leasehold title to the Project. The Opryland
Hotel Florida and the Project and all assets and Property constituting
Collateral are free and clear of all Liens and rights of others and any
underlying easements, covenants, conditions, and other encumbrances, except
Liens securing the Senior Loans, Liens securing the Secured Obligations and
Customary Permitted Liens. Except as otherwise described in Schedule 5.14 and
except to the extent that certain parts of the Project may not be operational
prior to the Substantial Completion Date, all Property owned by, leased to or
used by either Resort Owner is in good operating condition and repair, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, is free and clear of any known defects except such
defects as do not substantially interfere with the continued use thereof in the
conduct of normal operations, and is able to serve the function for which it is
currently being used. Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, nor
any transaction contemplated under any such agreement, will affect any right,
title or interest of either Resort Owner in and to any of such Property (other
than in connection with Liens in favor of the Senior Administrative Agent under
the Senior Loan Agreement and Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent). Each
of the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project is taxed separately without regard
to any other Property. Each of the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project may be
mortgaged, conveyed and operated as a parcel separate and independent from any
other Real Property, subject only to Customary Permitted Liens.


                                       53

of all ownership interests in Opryland Hotel Nashville LLC, which is the fee
owner of the property known as Opryland Hotel Nashville.

         5.15     Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions; ERISA. Neither Resort
Owner, Borrower, Parent Guarantor nor any of its Subsidiaries is an entity
deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 of
an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is subject
to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of Loans
hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.15,
neither Borrower, Parent Guarantor, nor any of Parent Guarantor's Subsidiaries
is or shall while any Loans are outstanding be or become (A) obligated to make
any contributions to, or incur any liability on account of any funding
deficiency (as defined in Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA and Section 412(a) of the
Code) with respect to, any employee pension benefit plan qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, (B) party to or otherwise obligated to make any payments
under any agreement relating to any such plan, or (C) obligated to make any
payments under Title IV of ERISA.

                  (i)      the operations of each Resort Owner and the Opryland
Hotel Florida and the Project comply, and to Borrower's knowledge and Parent

administrative proceeding, order, judgment, decree, dispute, negotiations,
agreement or settlement respecting (1) any Environmental Laws, (2) any Remedial
Action, (3) any Claims or Liabilities and Costs arising from the Release or
threatened Release of a Contaminant into the environment or (4) any violation of

imposition thereof (but in any event before the same is reasonably likely to
result in either (A) the Property being sold, forfeited or lost or (B) the Lien

Holders of Secured Obligations being impaired) any such Lien for taxes,
assessments or other governmental charges or claims filed or otherwise asserted
with respect to any portion of the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, or (2)
shall fail to contest, or cause either Resort Owner to contest, any of the
foregoing and give security therefor within the time period specified in the
preceding clause (1) or, having commenced to contest the same, and having given
such security within such time period, shall thereafter fail to prosecute, or
cause

either Resort Owner to prosecute, such contest in good faith and with due
diligence, or fail to maintain such security for its full amount, or (3) upon
adverse conclusion of any such contest, shall fail to cause any judgment or
decree to be satisfied and such Lien to be released, then, and in any such
event, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be required to) at its
election, (x) procure the release and discharge of any such Lien and any
judgment or decree thereon, without inquiring into or investigating the amount,
validity or enforceability of such Lien and (y) effect any settlement or
compromise of the same, or furnish security or indemnity to the Title Insurer,
and any amounts so expended by the Administrative Agent, including premiums paid
or security furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company
bonds, shall be deemed to constitute additional Obligations and shall be secured
by the Collateral.

Administrative Agent for the Project and as "Loss Payee" as respects Loss of
Revenue insurance. The insurance policy shall be endorsed to also provide
guaranteed building replacement cost to the Improvements (exclusive of
excavation and foundation costs). All policy deductibles shall be in amounts as
commonly carried by operators of similar high-quality facilities in the same
geographic region and reasonably approved by Administrative Agent.

                  (2)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower

         business interruption with a 180-day Extended Period of Indemnity, or
         at least 90 days if coverage for 180 days is not available at
         commercially reasonable terms.

                  (4)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower

         insureds. Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower shall cause
         Texas Resort Owner to, also ensure that all subcontractors to the
         Project General Contractor maintain similar coverage with limits

                  (c)      The following insurance coverages shall be required
at all times for the Opryland Hotel Florida and, from and after the Opening
Date, for the Project:

                  (1)      Property insurance shall be required, insuring
         against loss customarily included under standard so-called "all risk"
         policies including flood, earthquake, vandalism, and malicious
         mischief, boiler and machinery, and such other insurable hazards as,
         under good insurance practices, from time to time are insured against
         for other property and buildings similar to the Opryland Hotel Florida
         or the Project in nature, use, location, height, and type of
         construction. Such insurance policy shall also insure costs of
         demolition and increased cost of construction (which insurance may
         contain a sublimit for demolition and increased cost of construction of
         not less than $5,000,000), and for operation of building laws for the
         policy limit to the extent available at commercially reasonable terms,
         but in any event for a sublimit of not less than twenty-five percent
         (25%) of the full insurable value of each of the Opryland Hotel Florida
         and the Project. The amount of such insurance shall be not less than
         one hundred percent (100%) of the replacement cost value of the
         Improvements (exclusive of excavation and foundation costs). Flood
         insurance shall be procured in an amount not less than $30,000,000 and
         shall include a sublimit of not less than $500,000 coverage for
         improvements to landscaping, to the extent such coverage is available
         under standard policies at commercially reasonable terms. Earthquake
         limits of liability shall be not less than $5,000,000 or such greater
         amount as is customarily carried by operators of similar high quality
         lodging facilities in the same geographic region. Each such insurance
         policy shall contain an agreed amount or replacement cost endorsement.
         The insurance policies shall be endorsed to also provide guaranteed
         building replacement cost to the Improvements (exclusive of excavation
         and foundation costs). All policy deductibles shall be in amounts as
         commonly carried by operators of similar high-quality facilities in the
         same geographic region and reasonably approved by Administrative Agent.

                  (2)      Business interruption insurance shall be required in
         an amount that equals not less than 6 months projected Net Operating
         Income and payment of debt service on the Loans, and be endorsed to
         provide a 180-day Extended Period of Indemnity, or at least 90 days if
         coverage for 180 days is not available at commercially reasonable
         terms. The Administrative Agent shall be named as Loss Payee as
         respects this coverage.

                  (3)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower
         shall cause each Resort Owner and any Property Manager to, obtain and
         maintain General Public Liability


                                       66
<PAGE>

         insurance, including, without limitation, Commercial General Liability
         insurance; Owned, Hired and Non Owned Auto Liability, and Umbrella
         Liability coverage for Personal Injury, Bodily Injury, Death, Accident
         and Property Damage, providing in combination no less than $100,000,000
         per occurrence and in the annual aggregate, including, but not limited
         to, coverage for elevators, escalators, independent contractors,
         Contractual Liability (covering, to the maximum extent permitted by
         law, Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's obligation to indemnify the
         Administrative Agent and Lenders as required under this Agreement),
         Products and Completed Operations Liability coverage.

                  (4)      Workers Compensation and Disability insurance as
         required by law.

         (5) Such other types and amounts of insurance with respect to the
         Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project and the operation thereof which
         are commonly maintained in the case of other property and buildings
         similar to the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project in nature, use,
         location, height, and type of construction, as may from time to time be
         reasonably required by the Administrative Agent.

                  (d)      To the extent the "all risk" property coverages
required to be maintained by the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6 do not
cover acts of terrorism, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower shall
cause the applicable Resort Owner to, obtain separate terrorism coverage for the
Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project in such amounts as are being obtained at
such time by companies of established repute and engaged in the same or similar
business, provided that such coverage shall not be required (x) to exceed the
sum of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure and the Aggregate Available
Commitment, as such terms are defined in the Senior Loan Agreement, and (y) to
the extent that it is not commercially available on commercially reasonable
terms. All insurance policies (excluding policies in excess of $50,000,000)
required hereunder shall be issued by an insurer or insurers with an A.M. Best
rating of A-VIII or better, and all primary carriers will be licensed to do
business in the State of Florida or Texas, as the case may be, and reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent. The Property, Boiler and Machinery
insurance policies shall also name the Administrative Agent and Lenders under a
standard mortgagee clause or an equivalent endorsement satisfactory to the
mortgagee and shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent in form and content. Business interruption insurance shall name the
Administrative Agent as Loss Payee. All Property insurance policies also shall
include a co-insurance waiver and Agreed Amount Endorsement. The amount of any
deductible under any insurance policy must be consistent with similar projects
managed by Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries. Without the
Administrative Agent's prior written consent, neither Borrower nor Parent
Guarantor shall, and Borrower shall not permit either Resort Owner, or any
Property Manager to, carry separate or additional insurance coverage covering
the Improvements concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with
that required by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Administrative
Agent, on reasonable prior notice to Borrower or Parent Guarantor, may examine
the insurance policies (whether in the possession of either Resort Owner,
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or an Affiliate) during business hours.

                  (e)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower
shall cause any Property Manager to, pay the premiums for the insurance policies
required hereunder as the same become due and payable. Borrower and Parent
Guarantor shall, and Borrower shall cause any


                                       67
<PAGE>

Property Manager to, deliver to the Administrative Agent certificates of the
insurance policies required to be maintained pursuant to this Agreement
provided, however, the Administrative Agent and Lenders shall not be deemed by
reason of the custody of such certificates to have knowledge of the contents
thereof. Borrower and Parent Guarantor also shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent, within ten (10) days of the Administrative Agent's request, a certificate
of each Resort Owner, Borrower and Parent Guarantor or their insurance agent
setting forth the particulars as to all such insurance policies. Prior to the
expiration date of each of the insurance policies Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent a certificate of insurance evidencing renewal of coverage
as required herein.

                  (f)      Each insurance certificate required hereunder shall
contain a provision whereby the insurer (i) agrees that such policy shall not be
canceled, terminated or reduced in coverage or limits below the coverage and
limits of insurance required by this Agreement, without in each case, at least
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, (ii) waives
any right to claim any premiums and commissions against the Administrative Agent
or any Lender, provided that the policy need not waive the requirement that the
premium be paid in order for a claim to be paid to the insured and (iii)
provides that the Administrative Agent is permitted to make payments to effect
the continuation of such policy upon notice of cancellation due to non-payment
of premiums. In the event any insurance policy (except for general public,
automobile and other liability and Workers Compensation insurance or any other
similar policies) shall contain breach of warranty provisions, such policy shall
provide that with respect to the interest of the Administrative Agent and
Lenders, such insurance policy shall not be invalidated by and shall insure the
Administrative Agent and Lenders regardless of (A) any act, failure to act or
negligence of or violation of warranties, declarations or conditions contained
in such policy by any named insured, (B) the occupancy or use of the premises
for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms thereof, or (C) any
foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken by the Senior Administrative
Agent pursuant to any provision of the Mortgages or by the Administrative Agent
with respect to the Pledge Agreements or any of the other Loan Documents.

                  (g)      Any insurance maintained pursuant to this Agreement
may be evidenced by blanket insurance policies covering the Opryland Hotel
Florida and the Project and other properties or assets of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor, the Resort Owners and any Property Manager or their affiliates,
provided that any such policy shall in all other respects substantially fulfill
the requirements of this section.

                  (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if at any time the Administrative Agent is not in receipt of written
evidence that all insurance required hereunder is maintained in full force and
effect, the Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation),
upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to Borrower (or such lesser notice as
may be necessary to prevent the lapse of insurance coverage), to take such
action as the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect its interests in
the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project, including, without limitation, the
obtaining of such insurance coverage as the Administrative Agent deems
appropriate, and all expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection
with such action will be paid by Borrower or Parent Guarantor on demand.


                                       68

         6.7      Compliance with Laws. Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and
Borrower shall cause the Resort Owners and Parent Guarantor shall cause all of
its Subsidiaries to, (a) comply in all material respects with all Requirements
of Law and all restrictive covenants affecting their respective businesses,
Properties, assets and operations, and (b) obtain and maintain as needed all
Permits necessary for their operations and maintain such Permits in good
standing. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall,
and Borrower shall cause the Resort Owners to, comply in all respects with all
Environmental Laws with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project
and shall not suffer or permit the Release or disposal of Contaminants at the
Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project in any manner that, in any single instance
or in the aggregate, would violate Environmental Laws.

         6.8      Alterations; Restaurant Facility. (a) With the exception of
the Restaurant Facility and the Project Construction and change orders
respecting the same made in accordance with Section 6.12 of this Agreement,
neither Borrower nor Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower shall not permit
either Resort Owner to, without the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent, make, suffer or permit any alterations to the Opryland Hotel Florida or
the Project (other than as contemplated by the Approved FF&E Budget of each
Resort Owner) having a cost in excess of $4,000,000.00 in the aggregate for both
the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project in any Fiscal Year.

                  (b)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall not, and Borrower
shall not permit Texas Resort Owner to, commence construction of the Restaurant
Facility, unless and until (i) Texas Resort Owner shall have submitted and the
Administrative Agent shall have approved plans and specifications and a schedule
for the construction and completion of such restaurant, which plans,
specifications and schedule shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, and (ii) Texas Resort Owner shall have furnished evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that such restaurant, and
the development, construction and operation thereof, will have no adverse effect
on the Project Schedule or the value or utility of the Project. Neither the
plans and specifications nor the schedule for construction of the Restaurant
Facility shall be materially altered without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         6.9      Inspections; Books and Records.

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent, and any authorized
representative(s) designated by the Administrative Agent, shall have the right
at all reasonable times on reasonable notice (and (i) for so long as no Default
exists, at Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's expense, provided that such
inspections and examinations do not take place more often than annually, and
otherwise at the expense of the Lenders and (ii) from and after the occurrence
of a Default, at Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's expense) and any other Lender
shall have the right at its own expense: (i) to enter upon and inspect the
Properties of Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Resort Owners and Subsidiary
Guarantors (including the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project), both as part
of the Administrative Agent's general oversight (both prior to and after the
Final Completion Date) and to inspect the Project Construction to determine that
it is in conformity with the Approved Plans and Specifications and all the
requirements hereof; and (ii) to examine, copy and make extracts of the books,
records, accounting data and other documents of Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the
Resort Owners, any Property Manager and Subsidiary


                                       69
<PAGE>

Guarantors, whether or not the same relate in any way to the Opryland Hotel
Florida or the Project, all of which shall be made available promptly upon the
Administrative Agent's written demand therefor (including in connection with
environmental compliance, hazard or liability), and to discuss Borrower's,
Parent Guarantor's, Subsidiary Guarantors' and other Subsidiaries' and any
Property Manager's affairs, finances and accounts, including, but not limited
to, matters relating to the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project, with their
respective executive officers, as applicable, all upon reasonable notice and at
such reasonable times during normal business hours, as often as may be
reasonably requested. At the request of the Administrative Agent, Borrower and
Parent Guarantor shall furnish convenient facilities for the purposes of
conducting such investigations and examinations. No Construction Agreements let
or amended by Texas Resort Owner shall be inconsistent with the foregoing
inspection and examination rights. It is expressly understood and agreed that
the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to supervise or to inspect the
Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project (or any other Property) or any books and
records, that any such inspection shall be for the sole purposes of determining
whether or not the obligations of Borrower and Parent Guarantor under this
Agreement are being properly discharged and of preserving the Administrative
Agent's rights hereunder, and that the Administrative Agent's failure to inspect
or examine any matter shall not constitute a waiver of any of the Lenders'
rights hereunder. If the Administrative Agent or any other Lender should inspect
the Project or any books and records, neither the Administrative Agent nor any
other Lender shall have any liability or obligation to Borrower, Parent
Guarantor or any third party arising out of such inspection (other than any
applicable obligation hereunder with respect to confidentiality) and neither
Borrower, Parent Guarantor nor any third party shall be entitled to rely upon
such inspection or review. An inspection not followed by notice of default shall
not constitute a waiver of any Unmatured Default or Default then existing, nor
shall it constitute an acknowledgment or representation by the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender that there has been or will be compliance with the
Approved Plans and Specifications and Laws or that the Project is free from
defective materials or workmanship, or a waiver of the Administrative Agent's
right thereafter to insist that the Project be constructed in accordance in all
material respects with the Approved Plans and Specifications and Laws. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor any other Lender owes any duty of care to Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any third person to protect against, or inform Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any third person of the existence of, negligent, faulty,
inadequate or defective design or construction of the Project or of any other
Property.

                  (b)      The Construction Consultant, and any authorized
representative(s) designated by the Construction Consultant, shall have the
right at all reasonable times on reasonable notice at Borrower's and Parent
Guarantor's expense, (i) to enter upon and inspect the Project Construction up
to the Final Completion Date, to determine that it is in conformity with the
Approved Plans and Specifications and all the requirements hereof; and (ii) to
examine, copy and make extracts of the books, records, accounting data and other
documents of Texas Resort Owner, to the extent that the same relate in any way
to the Project, all of which shall be made available promptly upon the
Construction Consultant's written demand therefor (including in connection with
environmental compliance, hazard or liability), and to discuss Texas Resort
Owner's affairs, finances and accounts, including, but not limited to, matters
relating to the Project, with its executive officers, as applicable, all upon
reasonable notice and at such reasonable times during normal business hours, as
often as may be reasonably requested. At the request of the Construction
Consultant, Texas Resort Owner shall furnish convenient facilities


                                       70
<PAGE>

for the purposes of conducting such investigations and examinations. No
Construction Agreements let or amended by Texas Resort Owner shall be
inconsistent with the foregoing inspection and examination rights. It is
expressly understood and agreed that the Construction Consultant shall have no
duty to supervise or to inspect the Project (or any other Property) or any books
and records, that any such inspection shall be for the sole purposes of
determining whether or not the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement are
being properly discharged and of preserving the Administrative Agent's rights
hereunder, and that the Construction Consultant's failure to inspect or examine
any matter shall not constitute a waiver of any of the Lenders' rights
hereunder. If the Construction Consultant acting on behalf of the Administrative
Agent, should inspect the Project or any books and records, the Construction
Consultant shall have no liability or obligation to Borrower, Parent Guarantor
or any third party arising out of such inspection (other than any applicable
obligation hereunder with respect to confidentiality) and neither Borrower,
Parent Guarantor nor any third party shall be entitled to rely upon such
inspection or review. An inspection not followed by notice of default shall not
constitute a waiver of any Unmatured Default or Default then existing, nor shall
it constitute an acknowledgment or representation by the Administrative Agent or
the Construction Consultant that there has been or will be compliance with the
Approved Plans and Specifications and Laws or that the Project is free from
defective materials or workmanship, or a waiver of the Administrative Agent's
right thereafter to insist that the Project be constructed in accordance in all
material respects with the Approved Plans and Specifications and Laws. The
Construction Consultant owes no duty of care to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or
any third person to protect against, or inform Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
third person of the existence of, negligent, faulty, inadequate or defective
design or construction of the Project or of any other Property.

the Project shall be equipped with fixtures and equipment of good quality, all

Specifications therefor and all Laws, including all requirements and conditions
set forth in all Permits which have been obtained or are required to be obtained

to proceed with diligence to investigate and correct all material defects in the
Project and any material departures from the Approved Plans and Specifications
which have not been approved in writing by the Administrative Agent. Any
disbursement from the Completion Reserve Account shall not constitute a waiver
of the Administrative Agent's right to require compliance with this covenant
with respect to any such defect or departure from the Approved Plans and
Specifications or any other requirement of this Agreement.

         6.12     Changes and Amendments; Monthly Updates. (a) Except for

or terminate any material Project Agreement (other than by reason of a material
default by the applicable contractor or tenant) without the prior written
approval of the Administrative Agent in each instance. The Administrative Agent

action in contravention of this Section 6.12 without first notifying Borrower of
the matter in question and giving Borrower ten (10) Business Days within which
to refute or contest such determination.

         6.25.6   Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. As of the last day of any
Fiscal Quarter, Parent Guarantor will not permit the ratio of (i) Consolidated
EBITDA for the last full four Fiscal Quarters (after giving effect on a pro
forma basis to any acquisitions or dispositions of assets during such four
Fiscal Quarter period) to (ii) the sum of (a) Consolidated Interest Expense for
the last Fiscal Quarter (after giving effect on a pro forma basis to any
acquisitions or dispositions of assets during such Fiscal Quarter), multiplied
by four, plus (b) all capitalized interest expense for the last Fiscal Quarter,
multiplied by four, plus (c) required amortization of Indebtedness, determined
on a consolidated basis in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles, for
the last full four Fiscal Quarters, to be less than 1.5 to 1.0, provided that,
for the


                                       79
<PAGE>

purpose of such calculation, for the first four Fiscal Quarters ending after the
Opening Date, Consolidated EBITDA shall be adjusted by annualizing the portion
thereof related to the Project (by multiplying Consolidated EBITDA related to
the Project for the period from the Opening Date to the last day of such Fiscal
Quarter by a fraction, the numerator of which is 365 and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the period from the Opening Date through the last
day of such Fiscal Quarter).

         6.26     Environmental Audits. Upon the occurrence of (a) a Default
that is continuing, (b) a material change in Environmental Laws or (c) an event
with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project which, in the
reasonable determination of the Administrative Agent, could result in an
environmental issue, question or concern, Parent Guarantor shall at the
Administrative Agent's election (i) cause to be performed through the employment
of a consultant acceptable to the Administrative Agent, an environmental
assessment for the purposes of confirming compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement or (ii) reimburse the Administrative Agent, on demand, for all
reasonable costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with its employment of a consultant to perform such an assessment.

         6.27     Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds. (a) To the extent the
Senior Administrative Agent has not collected and received any Property Award in
accordance with the Senior Loan Agreement, and is not entitled to receive any
Property Award as provided therein, Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby directs
all insurers under policies of property damage, boiler and machinery, rental
loss, and rental value insurance and payors of any condemnation claim or award
relating to the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project to pay all Property Awards
(net of the cost of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and other reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such Property Awards) directly to
the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and other Holders of
Secured Obligations, and, in no case to either Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent
Guarantor. In the event of any loss or damage to any portion of the Opryland
Hotel Florida or the Project due to a casualty or condemnation event giving rise
to a Property Award ("Property Award Event"), so long as no Default has occurred
that is continuing, either Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall have
the sole right and authority to settle any claim for the Property Award;
provided, however, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to participate
in settlement negotiations with respect to Property Award Events in connection
with the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project which are reasonably likely to
result in Property Awards in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate. In the event
of either Resort Owner's, Borrower's or Parent Guarantor's failure to settle any
such claim for a Property Award within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
occurrence of the related Property Award Event or if a Default has occurred that
is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to settle all claims for such Property Award on behalf of either
Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent Guarantor.

                  (b)      Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower
shall cause the Resort Owners to, promptly after the occurrence of a Property
Award Event with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, commence
and diligently pursue the repair, restoration or reconstruction of the damaged
portion of the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project and the opening or
reopening and operation of the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project
("Restoration"); provided, however, that Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall, or
Borrower shall have caused the


                                       80
<PAGE>

relevant Resort Owner to, have prepared and delivered to the Administrative
Agent a budget for such Restoration which is satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

                  (c)      To the extent the Senior Administrative Agent has not
collected and received any Property Award in accordance with the Senior Loan
Agreement, and is not entitled to receive any Property Award as provided
therein, and in the event a Property Award with respect to the Opryland Hotel
Florida or the Project is paid to the Administrative Agent, such Property Award
shall be made available to the relevant Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent
Guarantor for the purpose of Restoration or, in the case of rental loss, rental
value and business interruption insurance, to be applied to debt service upon
the Obligations and for other permitted expenditures with respect to the
Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, subject in each case to the following
covenants and conditions:

                           (i)      No Default shall have occurred that is
continuing.

                           (ii)     As soon as practicable, but in no event
later than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the related Property Award
Event (A) Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall, or Borrower shall cause the
relevant Resort Owner to, deliver to the Administrative Agent written evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that, upon completion of the
Restoration, by the expenditure of the Property Award together with any funds
made available by such Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent Guarantor, the Opryland
Hotel Florida or the Project, as the case may be, will be of at least
substantially equal value, quality and character as the Project was immediately
prior to the Property Award Event, free and clear of all Liens except the Liens
in favor of the Administrative Agent and Customary Permitted Liens pertaining
thereto, (B) the Restoration shall be performed in compliance with all then
applicable Laws and with good construction scheduling and good construction
practices and (C) Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall, or Borrower shall cause
such Resort Owner to, deliver to the Administrative Agent for approval
preliminary plans and specifications for the Restoration setting forth the
construction schedule and budget. Final plans and specifications shall be
delivered to the Administrative Agent for approval promptly upon their
completion.

                           (iii)    If the Property Award is, in the
Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment, insufficient to complete the
Restoration of the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, as the case may be,
Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall, or Borrower shall cause the relevant Resort
Owner, to, promptly deposit the amount of the insufficiency in a cash collateral
account (the "Restoration Account") in the name of such Resort Owner, Borrower
or Parent Guarantor but under the sole dominion and control of the
Administrative Agent and pledged to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Holders of Secured Obligations pursuant to agreements satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. Such Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent Guarantor may not
use and, if applicable, the Administrative Agent shall not without the consent
of the Majority Lenders, to release, any Property Awards until any such
additional funds have been expended toward the Restoration and the budget for
such Restoration shall be "in balance" with the funds comprising the Property
Award sufficient to complete the Restoration. If at any time the Restoration is
"out of balance" with the budget and the remaining Property Award is no longer
sufficient to complete such Restoration, then such relevant Resort Owner,
Borrower or Parent Guarantor may not use and, if applicable, the Administrative
Agent shall not without the consent of the Majority Lenders, further disburse,
any portion of the Property Award until such


                                       81
<PAGE>

time as the Administrative Agent has determined, that the remaining Property
Award is sufficient to fully complete the Restoration. For purposes hereof, the
Restoration shall be deemed to be "in balance" only at such time and from time
to time, as the Administrative Agent determines that the Property Award (and any
additional amounts deposited in the Restoration Account with respect to such
Restoration in accordance with the paragraph) equals or exceeds the aggregate
amount of all unpaid costs, fees and expenses necessary for all work in
connection with the final completion of the Restoration, including the costs of
preparing plans and specifications, the "hard" and "soft" costs of the
construction of the base building and Improvements.

                           (iv)     The Administrative Agent shall be reasonably
satisfied that the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, when fully restored,
will constitute premises suitable for their intended use of the same or better
character and quality as existed prior to the occurrence of the subject Property
Award Event.

                           (v)      The Administrative Agent shall have received
and approved all documentation pertaining to the Restoration which has been
requested by the Administrative Agent, including the construction schedule,
construction budget, plans and specifications and any agreements between the
relevant Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent Guarantor and any Persons who will
perform services or furnish labor or materials in connection with such
Restoration (all such Persons and agreements being subject to the Administrative
Agent's, or as applicable, Majority Lenders' approval).

                           (vi)     The Administrative Agent shall have received
and approved Lien waivers, contractor's statements and affidavits reflecting
that as of the date of each disbursement, there are (or immediately after
disbursement there will be) no mechanics' liens (subject to the right to contest
said Liens set forth in this Agreement) or other unpermitted Liens pertaining to
title affecting the damaged Property.

                           (vii)    Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall, or
Borrower shall have caused the relevant Resort Owner to, have satisfied such
other conditions and terms as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably require
(which shall be consistent with those that would be imposed by a prudent
institutional construction lender).

Upon the completion of the Restoration to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Administrative Agent, and after paying all reasonable costs and expenses
relating to the subject Property Award Event and related Restoration, the
Administrative Agent shall apply any unexpended balance of the subject Property
Award to prepayment of the Loans. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event that no Default exists that is continuing and the
Property Award with respect to a Property Award Event is less than $3,000,000 in
the aggregate, the Administrative Agent shall pay the entire amount of such
proceeds to the relevant Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent Guarantor promptly
upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, which proceeds the relevant
Resort Owner, Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall apply for the purposes of
Restoration.

                  (d)      Upon the relevant Resort Owner's, Borrower's or
Parent Guarantor's failure to satisfy the covenants and conditions set forth in
clauses (b) and (c) above with respect to a Property Award Event constituting
loss or damage to all or substantially all of either the


                                       82
<PAGE>

Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, the Administrative Agent shall have the
right to apply the Property Award to the Secured Obligations in the order of
priority set forth in Section 2.8(b). If the amount of such Property Award so
applied is less than the Secured Obligations, then a Default shall be deemed to
have occurred and the Administrative Agent shall have all rights and remedies
set forth herein, in the Loan Documents, at law and in equity.

         6.28     The Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' Actions for Their
Own Protection Only. Borrower and Parent Guarantor acknowledge and agree that
the authority herein conferred upon the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
and any actions taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect
to the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, to procure waivers or sworn
statements, to approve contracts, subcontracts and purchase orders, to approve
plans and specifications, or otherwise, will be exercised and taken by the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders for their own protection only and may not
be relied upon by Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any third party for any purposes
whatever; and none of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall be deemed to
have assumed any responsibility to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any third party
with respect to any such action herein authorized or taken by the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders, or with respect to the proper construction of improvements
on the Project, performance of contracts, subcontracts or purchase orders by any
contractor, subcontractor or material supplier, or prevention of mechanics'
liens from being claimed or asserted against any portion of the Project. Any
review, investigation or inspection conducted by the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders, any architectural, engineering or other consultants retained by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any Administrative Agent or
representative of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in order to verify
independently Borrower's or Parent Guarantor's satisfaction of any conditions
precedent to disbursements under this Agreement, Borrower's or Parent
Guarantor's performance of any of the covenants, agreements and obligations of
Borrower or Parent Guarantor under this Agreement, or the validity of any
representations and warranties made by Borrower or Parent Guarantor hereunder
(regardless of whether or not the party conducting such review, investigation or
inspection should have discovered that any of such conditions precedent were not
satisfied or that any such covenants, agreements or obligations were not
performed or that any such representations or warranties were not true), shall
not affect (or constitute a waiver by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
of) (i) any of Borrower's or Parent Guarantor's agreements, covenants,
representations and warranties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
or the Lender's reliance thereon or (ii) the Administrative Agent and Lenders'
reliance upon any certifications of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Project
Architect required under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or
any other facts, information or reports furnished to the Administrative Agent or
the Lenders by Borrower or Parent Guarantor hereunder.

         6.29     Storage of Property. Borrower shall cause Texas Resort Owner
to store all Property in its possession to be incorporated into or installed at
the Project (not as yet incorporated or installed in the Project) either (i) in
such bonded warehouse or warehouses, which provide sufficient security against
damage or pilferage, or other facilities satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, as may be selected by Texas Resort Owner and approved by the
Administrative Agent, all charges for such storage to be paid by Texas Resort
Owner promptly when due so that such Property shall not at any time become
subject to any Lien for such storage charges therefore or (ii) at the Project,
in a manner so as to provide security against damage or


                                       83
<PAGE>

pilferage which shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent and its representatives and the Construction Consultant
will be permitted access to such warehouse(s) and other locations(s) at all
reasonable times on reasonable notice to inspect all such Property. Borrower
shall cause Texas Resort Owner to provide the Administrative Agent with
satisfactory evidence that the insurance required to be obtained hereunder
protects such Property from loss or damage to such items occurring while stored
at any such location.

         6.30     Proceedings to Enjoin or Prevent Construction. If any
proceedings are filed seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent or declare unlawful
the construction or the occupancy, maintenance or operation of the Opryland
Hotel Florida or the Project or any portion thereof, Borrower or Parent
Guarantor shall, and/or Borrower shall cause the relevant Resort Owner to, at
their sole expense (i) cause such proceedings to be vigorously contested in good
faith and (ii) in the event of an adverse ruling or decision, prosecute all
allowable appeals therefrom. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Borrower or Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower shall cause the relevant Resort
Owner to, resist the entry or seek the stay of any temporary or permanent
injunction that may be entered and use its best efforts to bring about a
favorable and speedy disposition of all such proceedings.

         6.31     No Obligation to Monitor. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
the Lenders shall have any obligation to monitor or determine Borrower's use or
application of proceeds of Loans.

         6.32     Compliance with Agreements. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall, and Borrower shall cause each Resort Owner to, comply in all material
respects with its obligations under: (a) all Leases affecting the Opryland Hotel
Florida or the Project; (b) all material Project Agreements; (c) all agreements
with Affiliates; (d) any underlying covenants, conditions and restrictions of
record with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project; and (e) all
other material contractual obligations relating to the ownership, operation and
maintenance of the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project which are not described
in the foregoing clauses (a) through (d) above. In addition to the foregoing
Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, and Borrower shall cause each Resort Owner
to, enforce its material rights and remedies under the agreements described in
the foregoing clauses (a) through (e) above.

         6.33     Organizational Documents. Neither Borrower nor Parent
Guarantor shall allow any amendment, modification or other change to any of the
terms or provisions in any of its Organizational Documents (or any
Organizational Documents of either Resort Owner or any of the Subsidiary
Guarantors) without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
which, in the case of any amendment, modification or other change to the
Organizational Documents of a Subsidiary Guarantor that is not adverse to the
interests of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

         6.34     Leasing Provisions. Borrower shall not, and Borrower shall not
permit the Resort Owners to, enter into, terminate, cancel, amend, restate,
supplement or otherwise modify any Lease at the Opryland Hotel Florida or the
Project without the Administrative Agent's prior written approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, provided that the tenant, if the Administrative
Agent requires it to do so, enters into a subordination, non-disturbance and
attornment agreement in the form required by the Administrative Agent, subject
to reasonable


                                       84
<PAGE>

modifications requested by the tenant; provided, that the Administrative Agent's
approval shall not be required (a) for any Lease (or any amendment,
modification, supplement or termination thereof) which is (i) with respect to
demised premises within the restaurant, retail, business center, spa and laundry
premises identified as such on the Plans and Specifications and on the Florida
plans and specifications, (ii) on market-rate terms and conditions, and (iii) by
its terms expressly subordinate to the applicable Mortgage (any such Lease, an
"Ancillary Space Lease") or (b) to terminate any Lease by reason of a default by
the tenant thereunder, provided that such termination is commercially
reasonable.

         6.35     Ground Lease Covenants. (a) Borrower shall cause each Resort
Owner to pay when due the rent and all other sums and charges mentioned in, and
payable under, the Florida Hotel Ground Lease and the Texas Hotel Ground Lease,
as applicable.

                  (b)      Borrower shall cause each Resort Owner to (i) timely
perform and observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions required to be
performed and observed by it as tenant under the Florida Hotel Ground Lease and
Texas Hotel Ground Lease, as applicable (including, without limitation, all
payment obligations), (ii) do all things necessary to preserve and to keep
unimpaired the Florida Hotel Ground Lease and Texas Hotel Ground Lease, as
applicable, and its respective leasehold estate and other rights thereunder;
(iii) not waive, excuse or discharge any of the obligations of either the
Florida Ground Lessor or the Texas Ground Lessor, as applicable, under either
Hotel Ground Lease without the Administrative Agent's prior written consent; and
(iv) to diligently and continuously enforce the obligations of either the
Florida Ground Lessor or the Texas Ground Lessor, as applicable, under the Hotel
Ground Leases.

                  (c)      Borrower shall not do, permit or suffer (i) any act,
event or omission which would be likely to result in a default or permit the
applicable lessor to terminate or exercise any other remedy under the Ground
Leases or (ii) any act, event or omission which, with the giving of notice or
the passage of time, or both, would constitute a default or permit the lessor to
terminate or exercise any other remedy under the Ground Leases.

                  (d)      Borrower shall not, and Borrower shall not permit
either Resort Owner to, cancel, terminate, surrender, modify or amend or in any
way alter, surrender or permit the alteration of any of the provisions of any of
the Ground Leases (except pursuant to a Post-Closing Document) or agree to any
termination, amendment, modification or surrender of any of the Ground Leases
without the Administrative Agent's prior written consent in each instance.

                  (e)      Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
copies of all default and other material notices received by either Resort Owner
or Borrower from any party under the Ground Leases, and of any notice received
by either Resort Owner or Borrower from either the Florida Ground Lessor, the
Florida Master Lessor, Texas Ground Lessor or Texas Master Lessor of their
intention to terminate the Florida Hotel Ground Lease, the Florida Master Lease,
the Texas Hotel Ground Lease or the Texas Master Lease, respectively, or to
re-enter and take possession of any premises demised by the Ground Leases,
immediately and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day, of delivery or
receipt of any such notice, as the case may be.

                  (f)      Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Administrative
Agent copies of such information and evidence as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request concerning


                                       85
<PAGE>

either Resort Owner's due observance, performance and compliance with the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Ground Leases.

                  (g)      Borrower shall not, and shall not permit either
Resort Owner to, consent to the subordination of either of the Hotel Ground
Leases or the Master Leases to any mortgage or other lease of the fee interest
or any other leasehold interest in any of the premises demised thereby.

                  (h)      To the extent it has the right to do so under the
terms of the Ground Leases, Borrower, at its sole cost and expense, shall
execute and deliver (or shall cause either Resort Owner to execute and deliver)
to the Administrative Agent, within five (5) Business Days after request, such
documents, instruments or agreements as may be required to permit the
Administrative Agent to cure any default under the Ground Leases.

                  (i)      In the event of a default by either Resort Owner in
the performance of any of its obligations under the Hotel Ground Leases,
including, without limitation, any default in the payment of any sums payable
thereunder, then, in each and every case, the Administrative Agent may, at its
option, cause the default or defaults to be remedied and otherwise exercise any
and all rights of such Resort Owner thereunder in the name of and on behalf of
such Resort Owner. Borrower shall, on demand, reimburse the Administrative Agent
for all expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in curing any such default
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements), together
with interest thereon computed at the Default Rate from the date that such
expense is incurred, to and including the date the same is paid to the
Administrative Agent.

                  (j)      Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written
notice of either Resort Owner's intention to exercise each and every option, if
any, to renew or extend the term of the Hotel Ground Leases, at least thirty
(30) days prior to the expiration of the time to exercise such option under the
terms thereof. If required by the Administrative Agent, Borrower shall cause
each Resort Owner to duly exercise any renewal or extension option with respect
to the Hotel Ground Leases. If either Resort Owner intends to renew or extend
the term of either of the Hotel Ground Leases, Borrower shall cause such Resort
Owner to deliver to the Administrative Agent with the notice of such decision, a
copy of the notice of renewal or extension delivered to the relevant Ground
Lessor, together with the terms and conditions of such renewal or extension.
Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its
attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to execute and deliver, for and in
the name of such Resort Owner, all instruments and agreements necessary under
the Hotel Ground Leases or otherwise to cause any renewal or extension of the
Hotel Ground Leases.

                  (k)      Intentionally reserved.

                  (l)      Borrower shall not allow either Resort Owner to elect
to treat its Hotel Ground Lease as terminated, canceled or surrendered pursuant
to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (including, without
limitation, Section 365(h)(1) thereof) without the Administrative Agent's prior
written consent in the event of the bankruptcy of, or any similar proceedings
with respect to, the relevant Ground Lessor. Borrower shall cause each Resort
Owner, in the event of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings with respect to a
Ground Lessor, to


                                       86
<PAGE>

reaffirm and ratify the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability of
the relevant Hotel Ground Lease within the applicable time period therefor in
such proceedings, notwithstanding any rejection thereof by such Ground Lessor or
any trustee, custodian or receiver.

                  (m)      Borrower shall cause each Resort Owner to give the
Administrative Agent not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of the
date on which such Resort Owner shall apply to any court or other governmental
authority for authority and permission to reject the relevant Hotel Ground Lease
in the event that there shall be filed by or against either Resort Owner,
Borrower or Parent Guarantor any petition, action or proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or under any other similar federal or state law now or hereafter
in effect and if such Resort Owner determines to reject such Hotel Ground Lease.
The Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to serve
upon such Resort Owner within such thirty (30) day period a notice stating that
(i) the Administrative Agent demands that such Resort Owner assume and assign
the relevant Hotel Ground Lease to the Administrative Agent subject to and in
accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, and (ii) the Administrative Agent covenants
to cure or provide reasonably adequate assurance thereof with respect to all
defaults reasonably susceptible of being cured by the Administrative Agent and
of future performance under such Hotel Ground Lease. If the Administrative Agent
serves upon either Resort Owner the notice described above, Borrower shall cause
such Resort Owner not to seek to reject the relevant Hotel Ground Lease and
shall comply with the demand provided for clause (i) above within ten (10) days
after the notice shall have been given by the Administrative Agent.

                  (n)      During the continuance of a Default, the

perform and comply with all obligations of the relevant Resort Owner under the
relevant Hotel Ground Lease without regard to any grace period provided therein,
(ii) to do and take, without any obligation to do so, such action as the
Administrative Agent deems necessary or desirable to prevent or cure any default

limitation, any act, deed, matter or thing whatsoever that Borrower or Parent
Guarantor may do in order to cure a default under such Hotel Ground Lease and
(iii) to enter in and upon the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, as
applicable, or any part thereof to such extent and as often as the
Administrative Agent deems necessary or desirable in order to prevent or cure
any default of either Resort Owner under the relevant Hotel Ground Lease.

request is made therefor by the Administrative Agent, execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent or to any party designated by the Administrative Agent,
such further instruments, agreements, powers, assignments, conveyances or the
like as may be reasonably necessary to complete or perfect the interest, rights
or powers of the Administrative Agent pursuant to this paragraph or as may
otherwise by required by the Administrative Agent.

                  (o)      In the event of any arbitration under or pursuant to
any of the Ground Leases in which the Administrative Agent elects to
participate, the Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent
as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact (which appointment shall be deemed
coupled with an interest) to exercise, all right, title and interest of such
Resort Owner in connection with such arbitration, including, without limitation,
the right to appoint arbitrators and to conduct arbitration proceedings on
behalf of such Resort Owner and the Administrative Agent. All costs and expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with such arbitration and the
settlement thereof shall be borne solely by Borrower,


                                       87
<PAGE>

including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements.
Nothing contained in this paragraph shall obligate the Administrative Agent to
participate in any such arbitration.

                  (p)      The Administrative Agent shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to proceed in respect of any claim, suit, action or
proceeding relating to the rejection of any of the Ground Leases by the relevant
ground lessor as a result of bankruptcy or similar proceedings in respect of
such ground lessor, including, without limitation, the right to file and
prosecute any and all proofs of claims, complaints, notices and other documents
in any such bankruptcy case or similar proceeding.

                  (q)      Borrower shall cause each Resort Owner to deliver to
the Administrative Agent within ten (10) days after receipt of written demand
from the Administrative Agent, an estoppel certificate in relation to each
relevant Ground Lease setting forth (i) the name of the lessee and the lessor
thereunder, (ii) that such Ground Lease is in full force and effect and has not
been modified or, if it has been modified, the date of each modification

or if any facts or circumstances exist, which with the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both, would constitute a default under any of the Ground
Leases, setting forth in detail the nature of such default, fact or
circumstance.

                  (r)      To the extent of its rights under either of the
Ground Leases, Borrower shall cause each Resort Owner to obtain and deliver to
the Administrative Agent within thirty (30) days after written demand by the

and Borrower shall not permit either Resort Owner to, cause, permit, acquiesce
in, or consent to any changes or modifications to the zoning and land use

ability of Texas Resort Owner to construct the Project in accordance with the
Approved Plans and Specifications or either Resort Owner to operate the Opryland
Hotel Florida or the Project as intended or (ii) the value of the Opryland Hotel
Florida or the Project. Borrower shall cause each Resort Owner to give to the

                                       88
<PAGE>

zoning and land use ordinances and other Requirements of Law affecting the
Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project promptly after obtaining knowledge
thereof.

any Subsidiary Guarantor to change, its fiscal year for accounting or tax

Majority Lenders.

         6.38     Cooperation with Construction Consultant. Borrower shall cause
Texas Resort Owner to provide the items described on Schedule 6.38 to the
Construction Consultant on a current basis as the same are available from time
to time in order to permit the Construction Consultant to render periodic
reports to the Lenders with respect to the status of Project Construction.

         6.39     Security Interest in Accounts; Certain Remedies. (a) Borrower
and Parent Guarantor covenant and agree not to maintain, and not to permit the
Resort Owners or any Property Manager to maintain with respect to either the
Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project, any bank accounts, investment accounts or
other accounts other than the following (collectively, the "Accounts): the FF&E
Reserve Accounts, Completion Reserve Account and the Restoration Account (all of
which shall be maintained by Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Resort Owners, as
applicable, and not by any Property Manager) and the other accounts identified
in Schedule 6.39 hereto. To secure the payment and performance of the Secured
Obligations, Borrower and Parent Guarantor and the Resort Owners hereby pledge
and assign, subject to the liens and security interests granted to the Senior
Administrative Agent in respect of the Senior Loans, to the Administrative Agent
for the benefit of itself and the Lenders and other Holders of Secured
Obligations all of their respective right, title and interest in, and hereby
grants to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of itself and the Lenders and
other Holders of the Secured Obligations a security interest in and right of
set-off against, and, without limiting the foregoing, the right (exercisable
only after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default) to direct the
holders of the Accounts to set-off against and immediately to turn over to the
Administrative Agent: (i) the Accounts; (ii) all cash, instruments, securities,
investments and other property from time to time transferred or credited to,
contained in or comprising the Accounts or any of them; (iii) all statements,
certificates, passbooks and instruments representing the Accounts or any of

including, without limitation (A) interest, principal, dividends and other
amounts or distributions received with respect to any of the foregoing and (B)
property received from the sale, exchange or other disposition of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Account Collateral"). Borrower, Parent Guarantor
and the Resort Owners shall cause any Property Manager and the holders of the
Accounts (the "Account Holders") to execute and deliver notices and
acknowledgments of the Administrative Agent's security interest in the Accounts,
in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, prior to the
Funding Date or upon establishing each Account, as applicable. Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and the Resort Owners agree from time to time, at their expense, to
execute and deliver and promptly cause to be filed in the appropriate public
offices UCC financing statements and all further instruments and documents, and
to take all further action which Administrative Agent may reasonably request and
which are necessary or desirable in the opinion of Administrative Agent


                                       89
<PAGE>

or its counsel in order to create, preserve, perfect and protect any security
interests granted or purported to be granted hereby and enable Administrative
Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to
any Account Collateral. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Resort Owners hereby
authorize Administrative Agent to file one or more financing or continuation

all such further action and execute all such further documents and instruments
as may be reasonably necessary or desirable in order to create, preserve,
perfect and protect the security interest granted hereby, without the signature
of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or either Resort Owner where permitted by law.
Whenever applicable law requires the signature of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or
either Resort Owner on a document to be filed to preserve, perfect or protect
the security interest granted hereby, Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Resort
Owners hereby appoint Administrative Agent as its respective attorney-in-fact,
with full power of substitution, to sign its name on any such document.
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Resort Owners hereby agree that a photocopy
or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement covering the
Account Collateral or any part thereof shall be sufficient as a financing
statement where permitted by law. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Resort
Owners shall not further pledge, assign or grant a security interest in the
Account Collateral or any part thereof or permit any other lien to attach
thereto or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1 financing statement (except
those naming Administrative Agent as secured party) to be filed with respect
thereto.

                  (b)      After the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default, the Administrative Agent shall, in addition to all remedies conferred
upon it and the Lenders by law and by the terms of the Loan Documents, have the
right, but not the obligation, without notice to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or
either Resort Owner, except as required by law, and at any time or from time to
time to charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any portion of the Account
Collateral against the Secured Obligations and direct the disbursement thereof
to the Administrative Agent. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Administrative
Agent shall be irrevocably authorized to direct the Account Holders to withdraw
or transfer the Account Collateral from the Accounts and deposit or deliver the
same into an account of, or designated by, the Administrative Agent in its sole
and absolute discretion. The Account Holders shall be irrevocably authorized to
comply with any and all directions so given by the Administrative Agent.

                  (c)      In addition to (and not in limitation of) all other
rights or remedies granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant
to the Loan Documents, Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby grants the Account
Holders, their Affiliates and the Administrative Agent, in each case for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, a contractual right of
set-off against each of the Accounts and all of the Account Collateral.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, and without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.39, after a Default has occurred and during the continuance thereof, the
Administrative Agent may, at its sole and absolute discretion, (A) elect to
apply the Account Collateral in whole or in part to pay Opryland Hotel Florida
or Project expenditures, including expenditures relating to Project
Construction, (B) elect to have all or any portion of the Account Collateral
disbursed to a receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction and
thereafter held and disbursed by such receiver in accordance with the


                                       90
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent's directions; and/or (C) elect to apply all or any part of
the Account Collateral to the Secured Obligations in such order and in such
manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole and absolute
discretion.

                  (e)      The Administrative Agent may also exercise in respect
of the Account Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for
herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured
party under the UCC, and the Administrative Agent may, without notice except as
specified below, sell the Account Collateral or any part thereof in one or more
parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Administrative Agent's offices
or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other
terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Borrower,
Parent Guarantor and the Resort Owners shall, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, at Borrower's and Parent Guarantor's expense, execute and
deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such
other acts and things, as may be reasonably necessary or, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent or its counsel, advisable to make such sale of the Account
Collateral or any part thereof valid and binding and in compliance with
applicable law. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Resort Owners agree that ten
(10) days' notice of the time and place of any public sale or the time after
which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification.
The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of the Account
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Administrative
Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement
at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice,
be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

                  (f)      BORROWER, Parent GuarantOR AND THE RESORT OWNERS
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO NOTICE AND HEARING OF ANY KIND PRIOR TO
THE EXERCISE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OF ITS RIGHTS TO REPOSSESS THE ACCOUNT
COLLATERAL WITHOUT JUDICIAL PROCESS OR TO REPLEVY, ATTACH OR LEVY UPON SUCH
COLLATERAL WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR HEARING.

                  (g)      Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.39, after a Default has occurred and during the continuance thereof,
the Administrative Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for and to obtain appointment of a receiver of the Account
Collateral as a matter of strict right, to take possession of the Account
Collateral, and to apply and disburse the same in accordance with this
Agreement.

                  (h)      To the full extent that it may lawfully so agree,
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Resort Owners agree that it shall not at any
time plead, claim or take the benefit of any appraisement, valuation, stay,
extension, moratorium or redemption law now or hereafter in force to prevent or
delay the enforcement of this Agreement, the Loan Documents or the absolute sale
of any portion of or all of the Account Collateral, or the possession of any of
the foregoing by any purchaser at any sale under this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents, and Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Resort Owners, each for
themselves and all who may claim under Borrower, Parent Guarantor or either
Resort Owner to the full extent that Borrower, Parent Guarantor or either Resort
Owner now or hereafter lawfully may do so, hereby each waives the benefit of all
such laws.

Parent Guarantor will relocate its principal place of business, chief executive
office, place where it maintains its records, or residence, or change its name
or the name under which it does business or change its jurisdiction of formation
without, in each case, giving the Administrative Agent at least thirty (30) days
advance written notice thereof or without taking such steps as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably require (including, without limitation,
executing additional Financing Statements) to maintain the perfection of all
Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral.

         6.41     Documents of Further Assurance. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall, from time to time, upon the Administrative Agent's request, promptly

Liens upon the Collateral the Liens contemplated by this Agreement, (b) correct
any mistakes of a typographical nature which may be contained herein or in any
of the Loan Documents, (c) replace any Notes or other Loan Documents that may
have been misplaced, lost or destroyed (as evidenced by an affidavit to such
effect from the holder thereof), (d) acknowledge and confirm the unpaid
principal balance of and interest on the Loans and state whether Borrower or
Parent Guarantor claim any off-set or defense with respect thereto and (e)

                  (a)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall, from and after

and diligent basis, to satisfy all of the requirements (collectively, as the
same may be modified or adjusted in accordance with this Section 6.43, the
"Post-Closing Requirements") set forth on Schedule 6.43.

                  (b)      Texas Resort Owner may, from time to time, propose to
the Administrative Agent specific modifications to any of the Post-Closing
Requirements. Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, approve such
proposed modifications, provided that it determines that such proposed
modifications, taken in the aggregate together with any such modifications
previously permitted hereunder, are not likely to have a material adverse effect
on either the value or utility of the Project or the Collateral, or the rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, in each case
considered as if the Post-Closing Requirements were not subject to any such
modifications and were fully satisfied.

                  (c)      Any waiver or modification of any of the Post-Closing
Requirements (other than as contemplated by the preceding subparagraph (b))
shall require the affirmative consent of the Majority Lenders.

         7.19     There shall occur (a) an Event of Default under (and as
defined in) the Florida Hotel Ground Lease or (b) a default or other condition
or event that would permit the Texas Ground Lessor to terminate the Texas Hotel

         7.20     The Texas Master Ground Lease shall expire, be terminated or
otherwise cease to be in full force and effect, and the Texas Hotel Ground Lease

terms, subject to a first leasehold deed-of-trust substantially in the form of

security interest in the securities, assets or properties covered thereby,

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

         8.1      Acceleration.

                  (a)      If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
with respect to either Resort Owner, Borrower, Parent Guarantor, any Property
Manager or any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Obligations shall immediately become
due and payable without any election or action on the


                                       96
<PAGE>

part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the
Administrative Agent shall upon the direction of, and may, with the consent of
Majority Lenders, declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both,
whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which Borrower and
Parent Guarantor hereby expressly waive.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent may, and, at the request of
the Majority Lenders shall, at any time or from time to time while any Default
exists and is continuing apply any funds deposited in any of the Accounts to the
payment of the Secured Obligations and any other amounts as shall from time to
time have become due and payable by Borrower to the Lenders under the Loan
Documents.

                  (c)      At any time while any Default is continuing, neither
Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through either Resort Owner
shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds held in any Account. After all
of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, any funds remaining in
the Accounts shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to Borrower or paid
to whomever may be legally entitled thereto at such time.

                  (d)      If, after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to Borrower or Parent Guarantor) and before any
judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been
obtained or entered, the Majority Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so
direct, then the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to Borrower, rescind and
annul such acceleration and/or termination.

         8.2      All Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Default, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have all rights and
remedies set forth herein, in the Loan Documents, at law and in equity and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to pursue one or more of such rights and remedies concurrently or
successively, it being the intent hereof that all such rights and remedies shall
be cumulative, and that no remedy shall be to the exclusion of any other.

         8.3      Construction. In addition to and without limiting any of its
rights and remedies available hereunder, under the other Loan Documents, at law
or in equity, and without constituting an election of remedies, upon the
occurrence and continuance of any Default, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders may, (i) complete the construction of the Project or any part thereof
and take any other action whatever which, in the Administrative Agent's and the
Lenders' sole judgment, is necessary to fulfill the covenants, agreements and
obligations of Borrower and Parent Guarantor under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, including the right to avail themselves of and procure
performance of existing Construction Agreements and Project Agreements and (ii)
let any contracts with the same contractors and subcontractors or others and to
employ watchmen to protect the Project or any part thereof from injury. Without
restricting the generality of the foregoing, and for the purpose aforesaid,
Borrower and Parent Guarantor, and Borrower on behalf of each Resort Owner,
hereby appoints and constitutes the Administrative Agent its lawful attorney in
fact with full power of substitution and agrees that the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled, subject to Section 10.12 hereof, to: (A) complete the
construction of the Project or any part thereof; (B) use any funds in the
Restoration Account,


                                       97
<PAGE>

Completion Reserve Account or which may be reserved, escrowed or set aside for
any purpose whatever at any time, to complete the construction of the Project or
any part thereof; (C) advance funds in excess of the amount of any or all the
Loans to complete the construction of the Project; (D) make changes in the
Approved Plans and Specifications which shall be necessary or desirable to
complete the construction of the Project in substantially the manner
contemplated by the Approved Plans and Specifications; (E) retain or employ such
new general contractors, contractors, subcontractors, architects, engineers and
inspectors as may be required for said purposes; (F) pay, settle or compromise
all existing bills and claims, the nonpayment of which might result in Liens on
the Project or any part thereof, or prevent such bills and claims from resulting
in Liens against the Project or any part thereof or against fixtures,
furnishing, furniture or equipment or other Property, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the construction and equipping and furnishing of
the Project or any part thereof or for the clearance of title; (G) execute all
applications and certificates which may be required by any of the Loan
Documents; (H) prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings connected with or
relating to the Project or any part thereof; (I) take such action and require
such performance as the Administrative Agent deems necessary under any payment
and performance bonds, and make settlements and compromises with the surety or
sureties thereunder, and, in connection therewith, execute instruments of
release and satisfaction; (J) take possession of and operate the Project or any
part thereof; and (K) do any and every act which Borrower or Parent Guarantor
might do in its own behalf, it being understood and agreed that the foregoing
power of attorney shall be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be
revoked.

         8.4      Enforcement. Borrower and Parent Guarantor each acknowledge
that in the event Borrower, Parent Guarantor or either Resort Owner fails to
perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, any remedy of law may prove to be
inadequate relief to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders; therefore,
Borrower and Parent Guarantor each agree that the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any
such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.

         8.5      Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or
the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an
acquiescence therein, and the making of Loans notwithstanding the existence of a
Default or the inability of Borrower or Parent Guarantor to satisfy the
conditions precedent to such Loans shall not constitute any waiver or
acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not
preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing
signed by the Administrative Agent, and then only to the extent in such writing
specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law
afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1      Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties made herein and all obligations, covenants and agreements of Borrower
and Parent Guarantor in respect of taxes, indemnification and expense
reimbursement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, the making and repayment of the Loans and the termination
of this Agreement and shall not be limited in any way by the passage of time or
occurrence of any event and shall expressly cover time periods when the
Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may have come into possession or
control of any Property of Borrower or Parent Guarantor.

         9.2      Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit
to Borrower or Parent Guarantor in violation of any limitation or prohibition
provided by any applicable statute or regulation unless the same has resulted
from the failure of such Lender to comply with any requirements imposed upon
such Lender by applicable Law.

         9.3      Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.4      Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
among Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
relating to the subject matter hereof.

         9.5      Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder. Borrower and Parent Guarantor are jointly and
severally liable and obligated for each other's obligations hereunder. This
Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors
and assigns, provided, however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that the
Joint Book Running Managers, Co-Lead Arrangers and Syndication Agents (each, an
Initial Lender Affiliate, and collectively, the "Initial Lender Affiliates")
shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10, 10.10, 10.18
and 10.20 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right
to enforce such provisions on their own behalf and in their own names to the
same extent as if each were a party to this Agreement.

         9.6      Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any costs and out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent (but excluding overhead and internal costs) in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, review,
amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents, in connection


                                       99
<PAGE>

with disbursements hereunder and otherwise with respect to the Opryland Hotel
Florida or the Project. Borrower and Parent Guarantor agree to reimburse the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any costs and out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, but excluding internal administrative
overhead except for legal fees hereafter referred to in this sentence) paid or
incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, which attorneys may be
employees of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents in the event of a Default.
Expenses required to be reimbursed by Borrower and Parent Guarantor under this
Section 9.6 include, without limitation, the cost and expense of obtaining
Appraisals of the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project, provided that so long
as no Default shall exist that is continuing Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall
not be required to pay for Appraisals other than (i) the initial Appraisals by
Cushman & Wakefield obtained by the Administrative Agent prior to the Effective
Date and (ii) a single further Appraisal of the Project which the Administrative
Agent, may commission in its sole discretion.

                  (b)      Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby further agree to
indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Initial Lender Affiliates, each Lender,
their respective Affiliates, and each of their agents, shareholders, directors,
officers and employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties,
judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses
of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent,
any Initial Lender Affiliate, any Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto)
which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby (including
without limitation the Project Construction and any claims for personal injury,
property damage, economic loss, violation of Law, mechanics Liens, and patent,
trademark or copyright infringement) or the direct or indirect application or
proposed application of the proceeds of the Effective Date Advance hereunder
except to the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The obligations of
Borrower and Parent Guarantor under this Section 9.6 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

         9.7      Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing
documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent
with sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to
each of the Lenders.

         9.8      Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

         9.9      Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.10     Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the other hand
shall be solely that of borrower and


                                      100
<PAGE>

lender. None of the Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender Affiliate, or any
Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to Borrower, Parent Guarantor
or any Subsidiary Guarantor. None of the Administrative Agent, any Initial
Lender Affiliate, or any Lender undertakes any responsibility to Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor to review or inform Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any matter in connection with
any phase of either Resort Owner's business or operations. Borrower and Parent
Guarantor agree that none of the Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender
Affiliate, or any Lender shall have liability to Borrower or Parent Guarantor
(whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by
Borrower or Parent Guarantor in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by
the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought. None of the
Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender Affiliate, or any Lender shall have any
liability with respect to, and Borrower and Parent Guarantor hereby waive,
release and agree not to sue for, any special, indirect or consequential damages
suffered by Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor in connection
with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

         9.11     Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section
9.11(b) and Section 12.4, each Lender agrees that it will use its reasonable
efforts not to disclose without the prior consent of Parent Guarantor (other
than to its employees, officers, directors, auditors, advisors or counsel or to
another Lender, provided such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.11 to the same extent as such Lender) any confidential information
with respect to Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries which is now or in
the future furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (a) as has become
generally available to the public other than by virtue of a breach of this
Section by such Lender, (b) to the extent such information was legally in
possession of such Lender prior to its receipt from or on behalf of Parent
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries and was from a source not known to such
Lender to be (x) bound by a confidentiality agreement with Parent Guarantor or
(y) otherwise prohibited from transmitting such information to such Lender by a
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, (c) such information becomes
available to such Lender from a source other than Parent Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries and such source is not known to such Lender to be (x) bound by a
confidentiality agreement with Parent Guarantor or (y) otherwise prohibited from
transmitting such information to such Lender by a contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation, (d) as may be required or reasonably appropriate in any
report, statement or testimony submitted to, or in response to a request from,
any municipal, state or Federal governmental or regulatory body having or
claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the NAIC or similar organizations
(whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (e) as may be
required or reasonably appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena or in
connection with any litigation, (f) in order to comply with any Requirements of
Law applicable to such Lender, (g) to the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, (h) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements or such contractual counterparties' professional advisors; provided
that such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual
counterparty agrees in writing to keep such information confidential to the same
extent required of the Lenders hereunder, and (i) to any prospective or actual
transferee or participant in


                                      101
<PAGE>

connection with any contemplated transfer or participation of any of the Notes
or Commitment or any interest therein by such Lender, provided that such
prospective transferee shall have agreed to be subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.11.

                  (b)      Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that each
Lender may, but only in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or the participation of such Lender
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, share with any of its
affiliates any information related to Parent Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any nonpublic customer information
regarding the creditworthiness of Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries,
provided such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 9.11 to
the same extent as such Lender).

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
confidential information shall not include, and the Administrative Agent and
each Lender may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with
respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to the Administrative Agent or such Lender
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that with respect to
any document or similar item that in either case contains information concerning
the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as other
information, this sentence shall apply only to such portions of the document or
similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Loan and
transactions contemplated hereby.

         9.12     Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not
relying on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the Loans
provided for herein.

         9.13     Disclosure. Borrower, Parent Guarantor and each Lender hereby
(i) acknowledge and agree that Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown Inc. and/or their respective Affiliates from time to time may
hold investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and any of their Affiliates, and (ii) waive any
liability of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
Inc. and/or their respective Affiliates to Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Lender, respectively, arising out of or resulting from such investments, loans
or relationships.

         9.14     Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in
favor of Borrower or Parent Guarantor or any other party or against or in
payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations. To the extent that Borrower or
Parent Guarantor makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders or any such Person receives payment from the proceeds of the Collateral
or exercises its rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to
a trustee, receiver or any other party, then to the extent of such recovery, the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens,
right and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had
not occurred.


                                      102
<PAGE>

         9.15     Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
the successors and permitted assigns of the Lenders. The rights hereunder of
Borrower and Parent Guarantor and any interest therein, may not be assigned
without the written consent of all Lenders, which may be granted or withheld in
the sole discretion of each.

         9.16     Inconsistencies. This Agreement and each of the other Loan
Documents shall be construed to the extent reasonable to be consistent one with
the other, but to the extent that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are
actually inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any other Loan Document,
this Agreement shall govern. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the existence of (and the Lenders' review of), the Organizational
Documents or any Project Agreements shall not be deemed to be an approval by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders of any of the actions that may be permitted
to be taken by Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any other Person thereunder to the
extent such actions violate the terms hereof. In addition to the foregoing, none
of the terms or provisions hereof shall be deemed to be waived or modified by
virtue of the fact that such terms and provisions conflict with, or contradict,
any of the terms and provisions of the Organizational Documents or any Project
Agreements.

         9.17     Disclaimer by Lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be liable to any contractor,
subcontractor, supplier, laborer, architect, engineer, tenant or other party for
services performed or materials supplied in connection with any work performed
at the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project or any other Property. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor the Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be
liable for any debts or claims accruing in favor of any such parties against
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or others or against any Property. Neither Resort
Owner, Borrower nor Parent Guarantor shall be an agent of either the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any Initial Lender Affiliate for any
purposes and neither the Lenders nor the Administrative Agent nor any Initial
Lender Affiliate shall be deemed partners or joint venturers with Borrower,
Parent Guarantor or any other Person. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be deemed to be in privity of
contract with any contractor or provider of services to the Opryland Hotel
Florida or the Project, nor shall any payment of funds directly to a contractor
or subcontractor or provider of services be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary status or recognition of same by either the Administrative Agent or
the Lenders or any Initial Lender Affiliate, and Borrower and Parent Guarantor
each agree to hold the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Initial Lender
Affiliates harmless from any of the damages and expenses resulting from such a
construction of the relationship of the parties or any assertion thereof.

         9.18     Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of each and
every term and provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         9.19     Protective Advances. The Administrative Agent may from time to
time, before or after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default,
subject to the prior written approval of the Majority Lenders, make such
disbursements and advances pursuant to the Loan Documents (which disbursements
and advances shall be deemed to be "Loans" made hereunder)


                                      103
<PAGE>

which the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary or
desirable to preserve or protect the Collateral or any portion thereof or to
enhance the likelihood or maximize the amount of repayment of the Secured
Obligations ("Protective Advances"). The Administrative Agent shall notify
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and each Lender in writing of each such Protective
Advance, which notice (each a "Protective Advance Notice") shall include a
description of the purpose of such Protective Advance, the aggregate amount of
such Protective Advance, each Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof and the date each
Lender shall be required to pay its Pro Rata Share of the Protective Advance
(the "Protective Advance Date"), which Protective Advance Date shall be not less
than two (2) Business Days after delivery of the Protective Advance Notice. Each
Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of any
Protective Advance on the Protective Advance Date in the manner set forth herein
for the funding of Loans. Borrower or Parent Guarantor agrees to pay the
Administrative Agent, upon demand, the principal amount of all outstanding
Protective Advances, together with interest thereon at the rate set forth in
Section 2.7 applicable in the event of a Default. If Borrower or Parent
Guarantor fails to make payment in respect of any Protective Advance within
three (3) Business Days after the date Borrower or Parent Guarantor receive
written demand therefor from the Administrative Agent, such failure shall
constitute a Default. All outstanding principal of, and interest on, Protective
Advances shall constitute Secured Obligations secured by the Collateral until
paid in full by Borrower or Parent Guarantor. Upon the making of a Protective
Advance, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to any and all rights,
equal or superior titles, liens and equities, owned or claimed by any owner or
holder of said outstanding liens, charges and indebtedness, however remote,
regardless of whether said liens, charges and indebtedness are acquired by
assignment or have been released of record by the holder thereof upon payment.

                                    ARTICLE X

                    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS

         10.1     Appointment. The Lenders hereby designate Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas as Administrative Agent to act as specified herein and in the
other Loan Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder
of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to
authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other instruments
and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such powers and to
perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may
perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its respective officers,
directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

         10.2     Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement
and in the other Loan Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
respective officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan
Documents or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The duties of the
Administrative


                                      104
<PAGE>

Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent
shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder of any Note; and
nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, expressed or implied, is
intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent
any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document except
as expressly set forth herein or therein.

         10.3     Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. (a)
Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and the holder of each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and
shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial
condition and affairs of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary
Guarantors in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and
the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of such Persons and, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information with respect
thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at
any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements,
information, representations or warranties herein or in any other Loan Document
or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection
herewith or therewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the financial condition of
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary Guarantors, or be required to make
any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the
financial condition of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Subsidiary Guarantors
or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent does not represent, warrant
or guaranty to the Lenders the performance of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary Guarantor, any architect, any project managers, any contractor,
subcontractor or provider of materials or services in connection with the
construction of the Project and Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall remain
solely responsible for all aspects of the Project, including but not limited to
the quality and suitability of the Plans and Specifications, the supervision of
the work of construction, the qualifications, financial condition and
performance of all architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers, consultants and property managers, the accuracy of all applications
for payment, and the proper application of all Loans.

         10.4     Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent shall request instructions from the Majority Lenders with
respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Majority Lenders;
and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason
of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender or holder of any
Note shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent
as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining


                                      105
<PAGE>

from acting hereunder or under any other Loan Document in accordance with the
instructions of the Majority Lenders.

         10.5     Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution,
notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message,
cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent
or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent in good faith believed to be
the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder,
upon advice of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent (which may be
counsel for Borrower or Parent Guarantor).

         10.6     Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower or Parent Guarantor, the Lenders will
reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent, in proportion to their
respective "percentages" as used in determining the Majority Lenders, for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind
or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in performing its respective duties hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

         10.7     The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. With
respect to its obligation to make Loans under this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent shall have the rights and powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may
exercise the same rights and powers as though it were not performing the duties
specified herein; and the term "Lenders," "Majority Lenders," "holders of Notes"
or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates,
include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative
Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind
of banking, investment banking, trust or other business with Borrower, Parent
Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Affiliate of any such Person as if
it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
other consideration from any such Person for services in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and otherwise without having to account for
the same to the Lenders.

         10.8     Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a
written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case
may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or endorsee, as the
case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

         10.9     Resignation by the Administrative Agent. (a) The
Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and
duties hereunder and/or under the other Loan


                                      106
<PAGE>

Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and the Lenders. Such resignation shall take effect
upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to clauses (b)
and (c) below or as otherwise provided below. Furthermore, Administrative Agent
may be removed by the Majority Lenders in the event that Administrative Agent
committed a willful breach of, or was grossly negligent in the performance of,
its material obligations hereunder (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable decision).

                  (b)      Upon any such notice of resignation by the
Administrative Agent, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall appoint a successor
Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a commercial Lender or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Majority Lenders (it being understood
and agreed that any Lender is deemed to be acceptable to the Majority Lenders),
provided that, if a Default or an Unmatured Default exists at the time of such
resignation, the Majority Lenders shall appoint such successor Administrative
Agent.

                  (c)      If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have
been so appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent,
with the consent of Borrower and Parent Guarantor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who
shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if
any, as Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Majority Lenders, as the case may be,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

                  (d)      If no successor Administrative Agent has been
appointed pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above by the 30th Business Day after the
date such notice of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent's resignation shall become effective and the Majority
Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder and/or under any other Loan Document until such time, if any, as
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or the Majority Lenders, as the case may be, appoint
a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

         10.10    Other Agents. None of the Co-Lead Arrangers nor the Joint Book
Running Managers nor the Syndication Agents shall have any liabilities or
obligations hereunder in their respective capacities as such.

         10.11    Lender Default. If any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") fails to
fund its Pro Rata Share of any Loan on or before the time required pursuant to
this Agreement, or fails to fund its Pro Rata Share of any amount due under
Section 10.14(d) or the last sentence of Section 10.12 on or before the time
required thereunder or fails to pay the Administrative Agent, within twenty (20)
days of demand (which demand shall be accompanied by invoices or other
reasonable back up information demonstrating the amount owed), such Lender's Pro
Rata Share of any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or disbursements incurred or
made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the
aggregate amount which the Defaulting Lender fails to pay or fund is herein
referred to as the "Default Amount"; and each such failure by a Lender is
referred to herein as a "Lender Default"), then, in addition to the rights and
remedies that may be available to the Non-Defaulting Lenders at law and in
equity:


                                      107
<PAGE>

                  (a)      The Defaulting Lender's right to participate in the
administration of the Obligations and the Loan Documents, including without
limitation, any rights to vote upon, consent to or direct any action of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall be suspended and such rights shall not
be reinstated unless and until such default is cured, provided, however, that if
the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall
continue to have all rights provided for in this Agreement and the Loan
Agreement with respect to the administration of the Loans, unless the Majority
Lenders vote to remove and replace the Administrative Agent, in which event the
Majority Lenders shall notify the Administrative Agent, Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and the other Lenders of the identity of the successor Administrative
Agent so chosen by the Majority Lenders and such successor Administrative Agent
shall assume all the rights and duties of Administrative Agent hereunder as of
the date such notice is given;

                  (b)      If and to the extent the Default Amount includes an
amount which, if advanced by the Defaulting Lender, would be applied to
interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders under the Loan Documents
(such portion of the Default Amount is herein referred to as the "Lender Payment
Portion"), the Administrative Agent may, and shall upon the direction of the
Majority Lenders, treat as advanced by the Defaulting Lender to itself (with a
corresponding automatic increase in the Defaulting Lender's Loan balance, and
without necessity for executing any further documents) the Lender Payment
Portion, whereupon a corresponding offset shall be made against the Default
Amount;

                  (c)      If and to the extent any Default Amount remains
(after taking into account the deemed advance and application made under Section
10.11(b) above), any or all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders shall be entitled (but
shall not be obligated) to fund all or part of the remaining Default Amount (the
"Funded Default Amount"), and collect from the Defaulting Lender or from amounts
otherwise payable to the Defaulting Lender interest at the Default Rate on the
Funded Default Amount for the period from the date on which the payment was due
until the date on which payment is made (less any interest actually paid by
Borrower on the Funded Default Amount from time to time, which payments shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent pari passu to the Non-Defaulting Lenders
which shall have so funded the Funded Default Amount);

                  (d)      So long as any Default Amount remains outstanding,
the Defaulting Lender's interest in the Obligations and the Loan Documents and
proceeds thereof shall be subordinated to the interest of the Non-Defaulting
Lenders in the Obligations and the Loan Documents in the manner set forth in
Section 10.11(e) below, without necessity for executing any further documents,
provided that such Defaulting Lender's interest in the Obligations and the Loan
Documents and the proceeds thereof shall no longer be so subordinated if the
Default Amount (and all interest which has accrued pursuant to Section 10.11(c)
above) shall be repaid (or, if not funded by the Non-Defaulting Lenders,
advanced to the Administrative Agent for disbursement in accordance with this
Agreement) in full;

                  (e)      To achieve such subordination, that portion of all
amounts received by the Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations which
would otherwise be payable to the Defaulting Lender on account of its interest
in the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:


                                      108
<PAGE>

                           (i)      first to pay pari passu to the
Non-Defaulting Lenders the Funded Default Amount, together with interest thereon
payable under Section 10.11(c) above, until the Funded Default Amount and all
interest thereon has been repaid in full (with collections from Borrower being
deemed earned by the Defaulting Lender to the extent of its Pro Rata Share
thereof and paid over to the Non-Defaulting Lenders for application first to
interest (in accordance with Section 10.13(c) above and then to principal upon
the Funded Default Amount); then

                           (ii)     second, the remainder, if any, shall be
deemed earned by the Defaulting Lender to the extent of its Pro Rata Share
thereof and held in escrow by the Administrative Agent for distribution as
follows:

                                    (A)      upon payment in full of all the
Secured Obligations, without foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (or other
similar disposition of the Collateral) or other enforcement proceedings with
respect to the Secured Obligations, the funds held in escrow shall be promptly
disbursed to the Defaulting Lender; and

                                    (B)      upon completion of any foreclosure,
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (or other similar disposition of the Collateral) or
other enforcement proceedings with respect to the Secured Obligations the funds
held in trust shall be promptly disbursed as follows:

                                    (1)      first, to the Non-Defaulting
                                             Lenders and their Affiliates which
                                             are Holders of Secured Obligations
                                             pari passu in the amount of all
                                             Secured Obligations which have not
                                             been paid and satisfied by the
                                             foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of
                                             foreclosure (or other similar
                                             disposition of the Collateral) or
                                             other enforcement proceedings with
                                             respect to the Secured Obligations
                                             in order to compensate the
                                             Non-Defaulting Lenders for any
                                             failure to recover the full amount
                                             of the Secured Obligations upon
                                             completion of any such disposition
                                             of the Collateral or other
                                             enforcement action; and

                                    (2)      second, any remaining funds shall
                                             be disbursed to the Defaulting
                                             Lender.

                  (f)      Each Non-Defaulting Lender shall have the right, but
not the obligation, in its sole discretion, to acquire such Defaulting Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the Loans and the Obligations, together with the Funded
Default Amount, in which case the following provisions shall apply:

                           (i)      If more than one Non-Defaulting Lender
exercises such right, each such Non-Defaulting Lender shall have the right to
acquire (in proportion to such acquiring Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares (or
upon agreement thereof, any other proportion) of the Defaulting Lender's Pro
Rata Share in the Loans and the Obligations, together with all of the Funded
Default Amount (being deemed a portion of the Obligations advanced by the
Non-Defaulting Lenders which funded the Funded Default Amount). Such right to
purchase shall be


                                      109
<PAGE>

exercised by written notice from the applicable Non-Defaulting Lender(s)
electing to exercise such right to the Defaulting Lender and the Administrative
Agent (an "Exercise Notice"), copies of which shall also be sent concurrently to
the other Lenders. The Exercise Notice shall specify (A) the Purchase Price for
the Pro Rata Share of the Defaulting Lender, determined in accordance with
Section 10.11(f)(ii) below, and (B) the date on which such purchase is to occur,
which shall be any Business Day which is not less than fifteen (15) days after
the date on which the Exercise Notice is given, provided that if such Defaulting
Lender shall have cured its default in full (including all interest and other
amounts due in connection therewith) to the satisfaction of the Administrative
Agent within said fifteen (15) day period, then the Exercise Notice shall be of
no further effect and the applicable Non-Defaulting Lenders shall no longer have
a right to purchase such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rate Share or the Funded
Default Amount. Upon any such purchase of the Pro Rata Share of a Defaulting
Lender and as of the date of such purchase (the "Purchase Date"), (X) the
Non-Defaulting Lenders purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share shall
also purchase the Funded Default Amount in equivalent proportions from the
Non-Defaulting Lenders which funded the same, for a purchase price equal to par
plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon under the provisions of Section
10.11(c) ("Default Amount Accrued Interest"), (Y) the Non-Defaulting Lenders
purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share shall promptly advance to the
Administrative Agent their proportionate shares of any unfunded portion of the
Default Amount, and (Z) the Defaulting Lender's interest in the Loans and the
Obligations, and its rights hereunder as a Lender arising from and after the
Purchase Date (but not its rights and liabilities in respect thereof or under
the Loan Documents or this Agreement for obligations, indemnities and other
matters arising or matters occurring before the Purchase Date) shall terminate
on the Purchase Date, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all
documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest. Without
in any manner limiting the remedies of the Lenders, the obligations of a
Defaulting Lender to sell and assign its Pro Rata Share under this Section
10.11(f) shall be specifically enforceable by the Administrative Agent and/or
the other Lenders, by an action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction
for such purpose, it being acknowledged and agreed that, in light of the
disruption in the administration of the Loans and the other terms of the Loan
Documents that a Defaulting Lender may cause, damages and other remedies at law
are not adequate.

                           (ii)     The purchase price for the Pro Rata Share of
the Loans and the Obligations of a Defaulting Lender (the "Purchase Price")
shall be equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the sum of all of the Defaulting
Lender's Loans (including advances for Protective Advances) under the Loans
outstanding as of the Purchase Date, less the Default Amount Accrued Interest
and costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
directly as a result of the Defaulting Lender's default hereunder, court costs
and the fees and expenses of attorneys, paralegals, accountants and other
similar advisors, and if such amounts are not then known, there shall be
deducted from the Purchase Price and placed into escrow with the Administrative
Agent an amount equal to 200% of the Administrative Agent's reasonable estimate
of such costs, to be held for disbursement to pay such costs as incurred, with
any remainder being returned to the Defaulting Lender upon payment in full of
all the Secured Obligations. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Lenders
purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share are entitled to do so at the
price set forth in this Section 10.11(f)(ii) due to the risk that the
Obligations and Collateral may further decline in value after such purchase as a
result of the Defaulting Lender's default.


                                      110

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to waive, diminish or
limit, or prevent or stop any Lender from exercising or enforcing, any rights or
remedies which may be available at law or in equity as a result of or in
connection with any default under this Agreement by a Lender. In addition, no
Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender if such Lender refuses to fund
its Pro Rata Share of any Loan being made after any bankruptcy-related Default
under Section 7.6 or Section 7.7 of this Agreement due to the lack of bankruptcy
court approval for such Loan.

         10.12    Authority. The Administrative Agent, as described herein,
shall have all rights with respect to collection and administration of the
Obligations, the security therefor and the exercise of remedies with respect
thereto, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein. The Lenders
agree that the Administrative Agent shall make all determinations as to whether
to grant or withhold approvals under the Loan Documents and as to compliance
with the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents, except to the extent
otherwise expressly set forth therein or herein. The Administrative Agent will
simultaneously deliver to the Lenders copies of any default notices sent to
Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the terms of the
Loan Documents and will promptly provide to the Lenders copies of any material
notices received from Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor,
including without limitation notices received under Section 6.17(d) and notices
received under Section 6.18 (and copies of the documents received by the
Administrative Agent thereunder). The Administrative Agent shall not, however,
take the following actions without first obtaining the consent of requisite
Lenders, as set forth below:

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent shall not, without first
obtaining the consent of the Unanimous Lenders, take any of the following
actions:

                           (i)      amend the interest rate, any date on which
interest is due, or the Maturity Date set forth in the Loan Documents;

                           (ii)     release any collateral for the Secured
Obligations, or release any guaranty, indemnity agreement or any Person
(including, without limitation, any Subsidiary Guarantor) with respect to any
such guaranty or indemnity agreement (except for the release of any Subsidiary
Guarantor from the Guaranty upon consummation of an Asset Sale with respect to
such Subsidiary Guarantor or substantially all of its assets and except for
releases otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents upon
satisfaction of all applicable conditions specified therein), or waive or
release any indemnity obligations of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any guarantor
(including, without limitation, any Subsidiary Guarantor) to the Lenders under
the Loan Documents;

                           (iii)    increase the amount of any Commitment;

hypothecation of all or any portion of the Opryland Hotel Florida or the Project
or any other Collateral except to the extent expressly permitted under the Loan

         As to any matters which are subject to the consent of any or all of the
Lenders, as set forth above or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent shall not be permitted or required to exercise any discretion or to take
any action except upon the receipt of the written consent or instruction with
respect to such action by the requisite Lenders, which written consent or
instruction shall be binding upon the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, it is understood and agreed that the Lenders'
right to consent to or disapprove any particular matter shall be limited to the
extent that the Lenders' or Administrative Agent's rights to consent to or
disapprove of such matter are limited in the Loan Documents.

         As to any matter which is subject to a vote of the Lenders hereunder,
any of the Lenders may require the Administrative Agent to initiate such a vote.
In such event, the Administrative Agent shall conduct a vote in accordance with
the provisions of the next paragraph. The Administrative Agent shall be bound by
the results of such vote, so long as the action voted in favor of is permissible
under the Loan Documents and under applicable law, and subject to the obligation
of each Lender to contribute its Pro Rata Share of all expenses and liabilities
incurred in connection therewith as more fully set forth below.

         All communications from the Administrative Agent to the Lenders
requesting the Lenders' approval (i) shall be given in the form of a written
notice to each Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter
as to which such approval is requested and (iii) shall include, if appropriate,
the recommendation of the Administrative Agent, if any.

         Subject to the foregoing limitations, each Lender hereby appoints and
constitutes the Administrative Agent as its agent with full power and authority
to exercise on behalf of such Lender any and all rights and remedies which such
Lender may have with respect to, and to the extent necessary under applicable
law for, the enforcement of the Loan Documents, including the right to exercise,
or to refrain from exercising, any and all remedies afforded to such Lender by
the Loan Documents or which such Lender may have as a matter of law.

         Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, each Lender shall be
responsible for its Pro Rata Share of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
expenses or liabilities incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with
the Obligations, the protection of any security for the Secured Obligations, the
enforcement of the Loan Documents or the management or operation of the Project
or any other Collateral after acquisition of title thereto. Each Lender shall,
within twenty (20) days after a written demand therefor accompanied with a
description of the amounts payable, contribute its respective Pro Rata Share of
the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, fees
of receivers or trustees, court costs, title company charges, filing and
recording fees, appraisers' fees and expenses of attorneys.

         10.13    Borrower Default. Promptly after the Administrative Agent
acquires actual knowledge that a Default has occurred, the Administrative Agent
shall evaluate the circumstances of such Default, its impact on Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors and the courses of action available to the
Lenders, which may include such responses as entering into a forbearance
agreement for a period of time, establishing certain additional credit or
collateral safeguards in exchange for a waiver of such Default or determining
the timing and order of enforcement of the remedies available to the Lenders.
Unless expressly directed in


                                      113
<PAGE>

writing to the contrary by the Majority Lenders, the Administrative Agent is
expressly authorized to discuss such Default and possible resolutions with
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors and to refrain from
exercising any rights and remedies while conducting such evaluation, provided
that the Administrative Agent shall not enter into any written forbearance
agreement with Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary Guarantor without
the prior consent of the Majority Lenders. The foregoing provisions shall not
limit the right, power or authority of the Administrative Agent to take actions
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1 or Section 9.19.

         The Administrative Agent shall, upon completing such evaluation and if
the Administrative Agent deems it appropriate, forward to each Lender a written
proposal outlining the course of action that the Administrative Agent
recommends, if any.

         If the Majority Lenders so approve the Administrative Agent's proposal,
the Administrative Agent shall seek to implement such proposal in due course in
the same manner the Administrative Agent generally implements similar proposals
for loans held for its own account.

         The Lenders agree to cooperate in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner in connection with the exercise by the Administrative Agent of
the rights granted to the Lenders by law and the Loan Documents, including, but
not limited to, providing necessary information to the Administrative Agent with
respect to the Obligations, preparing and executing necessary affidavits,
certificates, notices, instruments and documents and participating in the
organization of applicable entities to hold title to the Opryland Hotel Florida
and/or the Project. Each Lender agrees that it shall subscribe to and accept its
Pro Rata Share of the ownership interests in any entity organized to hold title
to the Opryland Hotel Florida and/or the Project and each such Lender agrees
that the nature of such entity shall be determined by the Majority Lenders. The
Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to act for and on behalf of the
Lenders in all day-to-day matters with respect to the exercise of rights
described herein such as the supervision of attorneys, accountants, appraisers
or others acting for the benefit of all of the Lenders in connection with
litigation, foreclosure, realization of all or any security given as collateral
for the Secured Obligations or other similar actions.

         10.14    Acquisition of Collateral. If the Administrative Agent (or its
nominee or designee), on behalf of the Lenders, acquires the Opryland Hotel
Florida and/or the Project or any other Collateral either by foreclosure or deed
in lieu of foreclosure, then the Lenders agree to negotiate in good faith to
reach agreement among themselves in writing relating to the ownership,
operation, maintenance, marketing, and sale of the Opryland Hotel Florida and/or
the Project. The Lenders agree that such agreement shall be consistent with the
following:

                  (a)      The Collateral will not be held as a long term
investment but will be marketed in an attempt to sell the Collateral in a time
period consistent with the regulations applicable to national banks for owning
real estate. Current Appraisals of the Collateral shall be obtained by the
Administrative Agent, such Appraisals shall be furnished to the Lenders from
time to time during the ownership period at the Lenders' expense (without
diminishing or releasing any obligation of Borrower or Parent Guarantor to pay
for such costs) and an appraised value shall be established and updated from
time to time based on such Appraisals.


                                      114
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Decision-making with respect to the day to day
operations of the Opryland Hotel Florida and/or the Project will be delegated to
management and leasing agents. All agreements with such management and leasing
agents will be subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders. All material
decisions reserved to the owner in such agreements will also be subject to the
approval of the Majority Lenders. The day to day supervision of such agents
shall be done by the Administrative Agent.

                  (c)      Except as provided in the immediately following
sentence, all decisions as to whether to sell the Opryland Hotel Florida and/or
the Project and any other Collateral shall be subject to the approval of all the
Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lenders agree that if the
Administrative Agent receives a bona fide "all cash" (as determined by the
Administrative Agent in its discretion) offer for the purchase of the Opryland
Hotel Florida and/or the Project or other Collateral which has been approved in
writing by the Majority Lenders and such offer equals or exceeds one hundred
percent (100%) of the most recent appraised values of the Opryland Hotel Florida
and/or the Project and/or such other Collateral, as applicable, as established
by an Appraisal or Appraisals that have been completed within six months of such
offer, then the Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized to accept such
offer on behalf of all the Lenders.

                  (d)      All expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders in connection with the Opryland Hotel Florida and the Project shall
be allocated among the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares. In the event any Lender does not pay its Pro Rata Share of such
expenses, such Lender shall be subject to the terms of Section 10.11 above.

                  (e)      All proceeds received by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender from the operation, sale or other disposition of the Opryland Hotel
Florida and/or the Project and any other Collateral (net of expenses incurred by
the Administrative Agent in connection therewith and any reserves deemed
reasonably necessary by the Majority Lenders for potential obligations of the
Lenders with respect to the Opryland Hotel Florida and/or the Project and
subject to Section 10.11 above) shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with
each Lender's Pro Rata Share from time to time upon authorization by the
Majority Lenders.

                  (f)      All expenditures and other actions taken with respect
to the Opryland Hotel Florida and/or the Project and any other Collateral shall
at all times be subject to the regulations and requirements pertaining to
national banks applicable thereto. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all necessary approvals from regulatory authorities in connection
with any expenditure of funds by the Lenders shall be a condition to such
expenditure.

         10.15 Documents. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, it is
acknowledged and agreed that (a) the Administrative Agent has not and shall not
provide to the other Lenders documents, other than Loan Documents delivered as
of the Effective Date, received from Borrower and Parent Guarantor with respect
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.1 or the conditions
precedent to the initial or any subsequent Loans, but that such documents are or
shall be available for inspection by each Lender, and (b) the determination by
each Lender of whether the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1 and 4.2
have been


                                      115
<PAGE>

satisfied shall be for the benefit of each such Lender only, and may not be
relied on by any other party.

         10.16    Receipt and Maintenance of Loan Documents. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has received, reviewed and approved the form of the Loan
Documents delivered as of the Effective Date. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and to each of the Lenders party
hereto on the Effective Date executed original counterparts of all of the Loan
Documents, other than the originals of the Notes, each of which shall be
delivered to the Lender named therein.

         10.17    No Representations. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that
the Administrative Agent has not made any representations or warranties, express
or implied, with respect to any aspect of the Loans, including, without
limitation (i) the existing or future solvency or financial condition or
responsibility of Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors, (ii) the
payment or collectibility of the Obligations, (iii) the validity, enforceability
or legal effect of the Loan Documents, or the Second Mortgage Title Insurance
Policies or the Surveys furnished by Borrower, or (iv) the validity or
effectiveness of the liens created by the Pledge Agreements, Second Mortgages or
any other liens or security interests required by this Agreement.

         10.18    No Relation. The relationship between the Administrative
Agent, the Co-Lead Arrangers, Joint Book-Running Managers, Syndication Agents
and the other Lenders is not intended by the parties to create, and shall not
create, any trust, joint venture or partnership relation between them.

         10.19    Standard of Care. The Administrative Agent shall be liable to
the Lenders for any loss or liability sustained in connection with its
management and administration of the Obligations, or in connection with the
exercise of any rights and remedies under the Loan Documents or at law, only if,
and to the extent, such loss or liability results from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Administrative Agent or any of its employees,
officers, agents or directors or a breach of the Administrative Agent's express
obligations under this Agreement.

         10.20    No Responsibility for Loans, Etc. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement (including Section 10.21), none of the Administrative Agent,
the Initial Lender Affiliates or any of their respective shareholders,
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any Loan hereunder;
(ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any
obligor under any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any agreement by
an obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (iii) the
satisfaction of any condition specified herein; (iv) the validity, effectiveness
or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished
in connection therewith; or (v) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or
priority of any interest in any collateral security. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of the Initial Lender Affiliates shall have any duty to disclose
to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished to it by
Borrower or Parent Guarantor.


                                      116

         10.21    Payments After Default. Subject to the provisions of Section
10.11 regarding the subordination of any Defaulting Lender's interest, after the
occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall apply all payments in
respect of any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral in the following
order:

                           (i)      first, to pay Obligations in respect of any
fees, expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Administrative
Agent;

                           (ii)     second, to pay principal of and interest on
any Protective Advance for which the Administrative Agent has not then been paid
by Borrower or Parent Guarantor or reimbursed by the Lenders;

                           (iii)    third, to pay Obligations in respect of any
fees, expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders (other than
Rate Management Obligations);

                           (iv)     fourth, to the ratable payment, on a pari
passu basis, of principal and interest on the Loans (such application to be made
first to interest and then to principal); and

                           (v)      fifth, to the ratable payment of all other
Obligations.

         The order of priority set forth in this Section 10.21 is set forth
solely to determine the rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders as among themselves. As between Borrower, Parent Guarantor and
Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and Lenders
on the other, after the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent and
Lenders may apply all payments in respect of any Secured Obligations, and all
proceeds of Collateral, to the Secured Obligations in such order and manner as
the Administrative Agent and Lenders may elect in their sole and absolute
discretion. The order of priority set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this
Section 10.21 may be changed by the Majority Lenders with the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent.

         10.22    Payments Received. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent from Borrower or Parent Guarantor for the account of the Lenders shall be
disbursed to the applicable Lenders no later than the next Business Day
following the day such payment is received in good funds by the Administrative
Agent. If payments received by the Administrative Agent from Borrower or Parent
Guarantor are not disbursed to the applicable Lenders the same day as they are
received, such funds shall be invested overnight by the Administrative Agent and
each Lender will receive its Pro Rata Share of any interest so earned. The
Lenders acknowledge that the Administrative Agent does not guarantee any
particular level of return on the overnight funds and that the Administrative
Agent will invest such funds as it deems prudent from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         11.1     Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law, if Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary Guarantor becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default
occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances,


                                      117
<PAGE>

whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any
other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of
any Lender to or for the credit or account of Borrower, Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary Guarantor may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Secured
Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Secured Obligations, or any
part thereof, shall then be due.

         11.2     Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other
than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5, in a greater
proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly
upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure
held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its
applicable Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure. If any
Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to
setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations
or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly
upon demand, to take such action necessary to provide that the Administrative
Agent and all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.8(b).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         12.1     Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor, the Resort Owners, Subsidiary Guarantors, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i)
Borrower, Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors shall not have the right to
assign their respective rights or obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii)
any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3. The
parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1
relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit assignments creating
security interests, including, without limitation, financings in the nature of
repurchase agreements and any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment creating a security
interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder
unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of
Section 12.3. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan
or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until such Person complies with Section 12.3; provided, however, that the
Administrative Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow
instructions from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to
direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of
the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be
bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent is the owner of any Loan (whether or not a Note
has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

         12.2     Participations.

         12.2.1   Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender, any Note held by
such Lender, or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In
the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain
unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the
owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it
in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts
payable by Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender
had not sold such participating interests, and Borrower and the Administrative
Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

         12.2.2   Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such
Participant has an interest which (a) forgives principal, interest, fees or
reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or
Commitment (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any
post-Default increase in interest rates), extends the Maturity Date, postpones
any date fixed for any required payment of principal of, or interest on any Loan
in which such Participant has an interest, or any regularly-scheduled payment of
fees on any such Loan or Commitment, (b) releases any guarantor of any such Loan
(except in connection with an Asset Sale in accordance with the terms hereof) or
all or substantially all of any collateral, if any, securing any such Loan; (c)
increases the amount of the participant's participation over the amount thereof
then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of
Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and
that an increase in any Commitment (or the available portion thereof) or Loan
shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participant's
participation therein is not increased as a result thereof) or (d) consents to
the assignment or transfer by Borrower or Parent Guarantor of any of their
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower,
Parent Guarantor and the other Lenders shall be entitled to rely upon any
actions taken by a Lender in its capacity as such, whether or not within the
scope of such Lender's authority under any agreement between the Lender and a
Participant.

         12.2.3   Benefit of Setoff. Borrower and Parent Guarantor agree that
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section
11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each
Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to
the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders
agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any
amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to
be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

         12.3     Assignments.

         12.3.1   Permitted Assignments. Subject to satisfaction of the
applicable requirements and conditions set forth in this Section 12.3, any
Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with
applicable law, at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities
("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents, subject to the following:

                           (i)      such assignment shall be substantially in
the form of Exhibit F or in such other form as may be agreed to by the
Administrative Agent;

                           (ii)     Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise
consents, each assignment with respect to an Eligible Assignee which is not a
Lender or an Affiliate thereof shall be in an amount not less than the lesser of
(A) $1,000,000 or (B) the assigning Lender's Outstanding Credit Exposure;

                           (iii)    Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise
consents, a Lender shall not be permitted to assign less than the entire
remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Outstanding Credit Exposure if upon
completion of such assignment the remaining amount (calculated as at the date of
such assignment) of the assigning Lender's Outstanding Credit Exposure shall be
less than $1,000,000; and

                           (iv)     No Lender shall assign all or any part of
its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents without the Administrative
Agent's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or to any Person
other than an Eligible Assignee.

         This Section 12.3 relates only to absolute assignments and does not
prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation,
financings in the nature of repurchase agreements and any pledge or assignment
by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any
Note to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such financing,
pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor
Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have
complied with the provisions of this Section 12.3.

         12.3.2   Transfers. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Lenders
consent to each Lender's pledge (a "Pledge") of its interest in the Loans and
the Collateral to any Eligible Assignee which has extended a credit facility to
such Lender (a "Loan Pledgee"), on the terms and conditions set forth in this
paragraph. Upon written notice by the Lender to Administrative Agent that the
Pledge has been effected, Administrative Agent agrees to acknowledge receipt of
such notice and thereafter agrees: (a) to give Loan Pledgee written notice of
any default by Lenders under this Agreement and any amendment, modification,
waiver or termination of any of Lenders' rights under this Agreement; (b) that
Administrative Agent shall deliver to Loan Pledgee such estoppel certificate(s)
as Loan Pledgee shall reasonably request, provided that any such certificate(s)
shall be in the form and upon the conditions set forth in Section 18 of the
Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement; and (c) that, upon written notice (a
"Redirection Notice") to Administrative Agent by Loan Pledgee that a Lender is
in default, beyond applicable cure periods, under such Lender's obligations to
Loan Pledgee pursuant to the applicable credit


                                      120
<PAGE>

agreement between such Lender and Loan Pledgee (which notice need not be joined
in or confirmed by Lenders), and until such Redirection Notice is withdrawn or
rescinded by Loan Pledgee, any payments to which such Lender is entitled from
time to time pursuant to this Agreement, or any other agreements that relate to
the Loans, shall be paid or directed to Loan Pledgee. The relevant Lender hereby
unconditionally and absolutely releases Administrative Agent and the Lenders
from any liability to the relevant Lender on account of Administrative Agent's
or any Lender's compliance with any Redirection Notice reasonably believed by
Administrative Agent or Lenders to have been delivered in good faith. Loan
Pledgee shall be permitted fully to exercise its rights and remedies against the
relevant Lender, and realize on any and all collateral granted by such Lender to
Loan Pledgee (and accept an assignment in lieu of foreclosure as to such
collateral), in accordance with applicable law and the provisions of this
Agreement. In such event, Lenders shall recognize Loan Pledgee, and its
successors and assigns which are Eligible Assignees as the successor to the
applicable Lender's rights, remedies and obligations under this Agreement and
the Loan Documents. The rights of Loan Pledgee under this paragraph shall remain
effective unless and until Loan Pledgee shall have notified Administrative Agent
in writing that its interest in the Loans has terminated. Notwithstanding any
provisions herein to the contrary, if a conduit ("Conduit") which is not an
Eligible Assignee provides financing to a Lender then such Conduit will be a
permitted "Loan Pledgee" despite the fact it is not an Eligible Assignee if the
following conditions are satisfied: (i) the loan (the "Conduit Inventory Loan")
made by the Conduit to a Lender to finance the acquisition and holding of such
Lender's Loan will require a third party (the "Conduit Credit Enhancer") to
provide credit enhancement; (ii) the Conduit Credit Enhancer will be an Eligible
Assignee; (iii) the applicable Lender will pledge its interest in the Loan to
the Conduit as collateral for the Conduit Inventory Loan; (iv) the Conduit
Credit Enhancer and the Conduit will agree that, if the applicable Lender
defaults under the Conduit Inventory Loan, or if the Conduit is unable to
refinance its outstanding commercial paper even if there is no default by the
applicable Lender, the Conduit Credit Enhancer will purchase the Conduit
Inventory Loan from the Conduit, and the Conduit will assign the pledge of the
applicable Lender's interest in the relevant Loan to the Conduit Credit
Enhancer; and (v) the Conduit will not have any greater right to acquire the
interests in the Loan pledged by the relevant Lender, by foreclosure or
otherwise, than would any other purchaser that is not an Eligible Assignee at a
foreclosure sale conducted by a Loan Pledgee.

         12.3.3   Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the
Administrative Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by
Section 12.3.1, and (b) payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 to
the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is
waived by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall become effective on
the effective date specified in such assignment. On and after the effective date
of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to
this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the
Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and the
transferor Lender shall be discharged and released with respect to the
percentage of the Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser,
without any further consent or action by Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Lenders
or the Administrative Agent. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the
Administrative Agent, Borrower and Parent Guarantor shall make appropriate
arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued
to


                                      121
<PAGE>

such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are
issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their
respective Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure, as adjusted pursuant to
such assignment.

         12.4     Dissemination of Information. Borrower and Parent Guarantor
each authorize each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any
other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law
(each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in
such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of Borrower, Parent
Guarantor and Subsidiary Guarantors; provided that each Transferee and
prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.

         12.5     Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                     NOTICES

         13.1     Notices. Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.10 with
respect to Borrowing Notices, all notices, requests and other communications to
any party hereunder shall be in writing (including electronic transmission,
facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (a)
in the case of Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages
hereof, or (b) in the case of any party, at such other address or facsimile
number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the
Administrative Agent, Borrower and Parent Guarantor in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 13.1. Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when
transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation
of receipt is received, (ii) if given by certified mail, return receipt
requested, when delivered at the address specified in this Section, as indicated
by the return receipt, or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered (or,
in the case of electronic transmission, received) at the address specified in
this Section; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article II
shall not be effective until received.

         13.2     Change of Address. Borrower, Parent Guarantor, the
Administrative Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of
notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                  COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This
Agreement shall be effective when it has been


                                      122
<PAGE>

executed by Borrower, Parent Guarantor the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
and each party has notified the Administrative Agent by facsimile transmission
or telephone that it has taken such action.

                                   ARTICLE XV

          CHOICE OF LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

         15.1     CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING
A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (EXCLUDING THE NEW
YORK LIEN LAW AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS), BUT GIVING
EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

         15.2     CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. BORROWER AND PARENT GUARANTOR EACH
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES
FEDERAL OR NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK OR ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL
OR FLORIDA OR TEXAS STATE COURT SITTING IN FLORIDA OR TEXAS, AS THE CASE MAY BE,
IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND
BORROWER AND PARENT GUARANTOR EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS IN
RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH
COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE
VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT
SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST BORROWER, PARENT
GUARANTOR OR ANY SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY BORROWER OR PARENT GUARANTOR AGAINST THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING
OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN
A COURT IN NEW YORK.

         15.3     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BORROWER, PARENT GUARANTOR, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN
TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED
WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.
