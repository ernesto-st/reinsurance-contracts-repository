7.4</U>, Lender will apply the Ground Lease Escrow Fund to payments of the Ground Rent. Upon a Cash Sweep Cure, Borrower shall deposit with Lender in cash or cash equivalent (including a Letter of Credit) to the extent necessary to achieve a balance
in the Ground Lease Escrow Fund equal to the Ground Rent which may be due during the month immediately following the month in which monthly escrows are discontinued (the amount then remaining in the Ground Lease Escrow Fund after giving effect to
such deposit, the &#147;<B>Subsequent Ground Lease Escrow Deposit</B>&#148;). If the amount of the Ground Lease Escrow Fund (excluding the Initial Ground Lease Escrow Deposit or the Subsequent Ground Lease Escrow Deposit, as applicable) shall exceed
the amounts due for Ground Rent, Lender shall, at the option of Borrower, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be made to the Ground Lease Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining in the Ground Lease Escrow Fund
after the Debt has been paid in full or the Individual Property subject to the Ground Lease has been released shall be returned to Borrower. In allocating such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on the records of Lender to be the owner of
the applicable Individual Property. If at any time during a Cash Sweep Period, Lender reasonably determines that the Ground Lease Escrow Fund (excluding the Initial Ground Lease Escrow Deposit or the Subsequent Ground Lease Escrow Deposit, as
applicable) is not, or will not be, sufficient to pay the Ground Rent by the date set forth in the first sentence of this <U>Section 7.4</U>, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payment (or
deliver a Letter of Credit in the amount of such increase) by the amount that Lender estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date of the Ground Rent. </FONT></P> <P

Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not
Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to any or all of the Collateral. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative
and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singularly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise
affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing to the extent Borrower may lawfully do so under Applicable
Law, Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Lender is not subject to any &#147;one action&#148; or &#147;election of remedies&#148; law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender
