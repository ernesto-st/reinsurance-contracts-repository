         Section 2.01. Commitments.

                  (a)      Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each
Revolving Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make advances in Dollars
(each such advance, together with each advance outstanding on the Effective Date
under Section 2.01 of the Prior Credit Agreement [which advances shall continue
hereunder], herein a

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 16

<PAGE>

"Revolving Loan") to the Borrower, at any time and from time to time on and
after the Effective Date and until the earlier of the Maturity Date or the
termination of the Commitment of such Lender, in an aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding not to exceed such Revolving Lender's Commitment,
subject, however, to the condition that the Revolving Exposure of a Revolving
Lender shall not exceed such Revolving Lender's Commitment and the total
Revolving Exposures of all Revolving Lenders shall not exceed the Total
Commitment. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay
and reborrow Revolving Loans hereunder subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth herein. Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a
Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Revolving Lenders ratably in
accordance with their Applicable Percentages; provided, however, that the
failure of any Revolving Lender to make any Revolving Loan shall not in itself
relieve any other Revolving Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being
understood, however, that no Revolving Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Revolving Lender to make any Revolving Loan required to be
made by such other Revolving Lender). The Revolving Loans comprising any
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount which is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 (or an aggregate principal
amount equal to the remaining balance of the Total Commitment less the total
Revolving Exposure of all Revolving Lenders).

                  (b)      Swingline Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make advances in such Available
Currency as the Borrower may request (each such advance, together with each
advance outstanding on the Effective Date under Section 2.20 of the Prior Credit
Agreement [which advances shall continue hereunder], herein a "Swingline Loan")
to the Borrower from time to time on and after the Effective Date, until the
earlier of the Maturity Date or the termination of the Commitments in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in: (i)
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans denominated in
Dollars exceeding $20,000,000; (ii) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent principal
amount of outstanding Euro Loans exceeding $25,000,000; (iii) the aggregate
Dollar Equivalent principal amount of outstanding Australian Dollar Loans
exceeding $25,000,000; and (iv) the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the
Total Commitment. The Swingline Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an
amount which is an integral multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $500,000 and
not less than $1,000,000 (or an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of
the applicable limit set forth in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above minus all the
Swingline Loans denominated in the same currency then outstanding). Within the
foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

                  (c)      Lender Participation in Swingline Loans. The
Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not
later than 11:00 a.m., New York, New York time, on any Business Day require the
Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a
portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the
aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of Swingline Loans in which the Lenders will
participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will
give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such
Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loans. Each Revolving
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as
provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
Swingline Lender, such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Dollar
Equivalent amount of the principal outstanding in connection with such Swingline
Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute
and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or
reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be
made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever;
provided that (i) the obligations of a Revolving Lender to fund its
participation in a Swingline Loan may be subject to avoidance by a Revolving
Lender if such Revolving Lender proves that the Swingline Lender knew (or with
the exercise of care should have known) that the conditions to the making of the
Swingline Loan were not satisfied and (ii) a Revolving Lender shall not have an
obligation to acquire or

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 17

<PAGE>

fund a participation in Swingline Loans if that obligation of the Revolving
Lender has been terminated or assigned to another Person in accordance with
Section 2.10(c) or Section 8.04. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Swingline
Lender (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Swingline Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care. Each Revolving Lender
shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
Dollars in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. Upon the funding of a participation under this clause (c) in
any Euro Loan or Australian Dollar Loan, the portion of such Loans so funded
shall be converted to Dollar Swingline Loans accruing interest as ABR Loans but
JPMorgan's Applicable Percentage of such Loans shall remain as a Euro Loan or an
Australian Dollar Loan. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of
any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph.
Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party
on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the
Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be
promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The
purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall
not relieve the Borrower of its obligation for the payment thereof in full,
notwithstanding any Default or Event of Default that may exist.

         Section 2.02. Loans.

                  (a)      Type of Loans. Each Borrowing (including any
Borrowing of a Swingline Loan) shall be comprised entirely of Fixed Rate Loans
or ABR Loans as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender
may at its option make any Fixed Rate Loan by causing any domestic or foreign
branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise
of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such
Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one
Type may be outstanding at the same time.

                  (b)      Funding Borrowings.

                           (i)      Revolving Loans. Subject to paragraph (c)
below, each Revolving Lender shall make each Revolving Loan to be made by it
hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of Dollars in
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent in New York, New York,
not later than 1:00 p.m., New York, New York time, and the Administrative Agent
shall by 2:00 p.m., New York, New York time, credit the amounts so received to
the account or accounts specified from time to time in one or more notices
delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall
not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall
not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Revolving
Lenders or, if such Borrowing is to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement, such amounts shall be distributed to the applicable Issuing Bank.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Revolving
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Revolving Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Revolving Lender's portion of
such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Revolving Lender
has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such
Borrowing in accordance with this paragraph (b) and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Revolving Lender
shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such
Revolving Lender and the Borrower (without waiving any claim against such
Revolving Lender for such Revolving Lender's failure to make such portion
available) severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Revolving Lender, the

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 18

<PAGE>

Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Revolving Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute
such Revolving Lender's Revolving Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of
this Agreement.

                           (ii)     Swingline Loans. The Swingline Lender shall
make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the
account or accounts specified from time to time in one or more notices delivered
by the Borrower to the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan
made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section
2.19(d), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m. (or if a
Fixed Rate Loan is requested, 2:00 p.m.), New York, New York time, on the
requested date of such Swingline Loan. With respect to the payment of any amount
denominated in Euros, the Swingline Lender shall not be liable to the Borrower
or any of the Lenders in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences
of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount required by this
Agreement to be paid by the Swingline Lender in Euros if the Swingline Lender
shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this
Agreement, the payment of such amount in Euros and in immediately available,
freely transferable, cleared funds to the account with the bank in the principal
financial center in the participating member state of the European Union which
the Borrower shall have specified for such purpose. "All relevant steps" means
all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or
operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Swingline
Lender may from time to time determine for the purpose of clearing settling
payments of Euros.

                  (c)      Continuations and Conversions. Borrower may Convert
all or any part of any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type and Borrower
may Continue all or any part of any Fixed Rate Borrowing as a Borrowing of the
same Type, by giving the Administrative Agent written notice on the Business Day
of the Conversion into a ABR Borrowing and on the Business Day at least three
Business Days before Conversion into or Continuation of a Fixed Rate Borrowing
specifying: (i) the Conversion or Continuation date, (ii) the amount of the
Borrowing to be Converted or Continued, (iii) in the case of Conversions, the
Type of Borrowing to be Converted into, and (iv) in the case of a Continuation
of or Conversion into a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the duration of the Interest
Period applicable thereto; provided that (a) Fixed Rate Borrowings may only be
Converted on the last day of the Interest Period; (b) except for Conversions to
ABR Borrowings, no Conversions shall be made while an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing; (c) only ten (10) Fixed Rate Borrowings (including
Fixed Rate Borrowings of Swingline Loans) may be in existence at any one time;
(d) no Interest Period may end after the Maturity Date; (e) a Borrowing
denominated in one Available Currency may not be Converted by the Borrower into
another Available Currency; (f) Dollar ABR Swingline Borrowings may not be
Converted to Fixed Rate Borrowings; and (g) Fixed Rate Euro Borrowings and Fixed
Rate Australian Dollar Borrowings may not be Converted to ABR Borrowings. All
notices given under this Section shall be irrevocable and shall be given not
later than 11:00 a.m. New York, New York time on the Business Day that is not
less than the number of Business Days specified above for such notice. If the
Borrower shall fail to give the Administrative Agent the notice as specified
above for Continuation or Conversion of a Fixed Rate Borrowing prior to the end
of the Interest Period with respect thereto, such Fixed Rate Borrowing shall
automatically be continued as a Fixed Rate Borrowing with an Interest Period of
one month's duration unless such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Dollar Borrowing and
an Event of Default exists, in which case such Dollar Fixed Rate Borrowing shall
be automatically converted to an ABR Borrowing. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.02.

         Section 2.03. Borrowing Procedure. In order to request a Borrowing, the
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the Administrative Agent a duly
completed Borrowing Request: (a) in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not
later than 11:00 a.m., New York, New York time, three Business Days before such
Borrowing, (b) in the case of a Euro Borrowing or an Australian Dollar
Borrowing, not later than 9:00 a.m., New York, New York time, three Business
Days before such Borrowing, and (c) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York, New York time, on the day of such Borrowing. Such
notice

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 19

<PAGE>

shall be irrevocable and shall in each case specify: (i) whether the Borrowing
then being requested is to be a Fixed Rate Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii)
whether the Borrowing is a Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Borrowing and if a
Swingline Borrowing, the applicable Available Currency in which the Borrower
requests such Borrowing to be denominated; (iii) the date of such Borrowing
(which shall be a Business Day) and the amount thereof; and (iv) if such
Borrowing is to be a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect
thereto, which shall not end after the Maturity Date; provided that (A) the
Borrower may not request a Fixed Rate Dollar Swingline Borrowing, an ABR
Australian Dollar Swingline Borrowing nor an ABR Euro Swingline Borrowing and
(B) each such Borrowing of the type described in clause (A) preceding shall not
be available herein. If no election as to the Type, currency or facility
applicable to such Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested
Borrowing will be a ABR Dollar Swingline Borrowing. If no Interest Period with
respect to any Fixed Rate Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
no Borrowing shall be requested if the Interest Period with respect thereto
would end after the Maturity Date. When a Revolving Borrowing is requested, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Revolving Lenders of the notice
given pursuant to this Section 2.03 and of each Revolving Lender's portion of
the requested Borrowing. When a Swingline Borrowing is requested, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Swingline Lender of the notice
given pursuant to this Section 2.03.

         Section 2.04. Fees.

                  (a)      Facility Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to each
Revolving Lender, through the Administrative Agent, a facility fee ("Facility
Fee"), at a rate per annum equal to the Facility Fee Percentage from time to
time in effect on the amount of the daily average amount of the Commitment of
such Revolving Lender (or if such Commitment no longer exists, on the Dollar
Equivalent amount of the Revolving Exposure of such Revolving Lender), during
the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of
the date on which such Revolving Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on
which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any Revolving Exposure. Facility Fees
accrued through and including each Interest Payment Date shall be payable in
Dollars on such Interest Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to
occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on
the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the
date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All Facility
Fees shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day) in a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case
may be. The Borrower agrees to pay to each Revolving Lender, through the
Administrative Agent, on the Effective Date all unpaid commitment fees accrued
under Section 2.04(a) of the Prior Credit Agreement.

                  (b)      Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay the
Administrative Agent the fees provided for in the Fee Letter on the dates
required thereby.

                  (c)      Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay:
(i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a
participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which
shall accrue at the rate equal to the Applicable Margin (as defined and
determined in accordance with Section 2.06(d)) on the average daily Dollar
Equivalent amount of such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Letter
of Credit Liabilities (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Revolving
Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Revolving Lender
ceases to have any Letter of Credit Liabilities; and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a
fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average
daily Dollar Equivalent amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities (excluding
any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable
to the Letters of Credit it has issued, during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the
Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any such Letter of Credit
Liabilities, as well as each Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the
issuance, amendment,

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 20

<PAGE>

renewal or extension of any of its Letters of Credit or processing of drawings
thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including
each Interest Payment Date shall be payable in Dollars on the third Business Day
following such Interest Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the
date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the
date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other
fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable
within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fee shall be
computed based on a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number
of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (d)      Payment Provisions. The fees payable under this
Section 2.04 (the "Fees") shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if
and as appropriate, among the Revolving Lenders or to the applicable Issuing
Bank. Once paid, none of such Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

         Section 2.05. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Indebtedness.

                  (a)      Repayment. The Borrower hereby unconditionally
promises to pay: (i) the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on
the Maturity Date; (ii) the then unpaid principal amount of each Dollar
Swingline Loan on the earlier of (A) the Maturity Date or (B) the later of the
first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a
calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is
made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Loan is made, the Borrower
shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding which are Dollar ABR Loans; and
(iii) the unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan denominated in Euros
and denominated in Australian Dollars on the Maturity Date. Payments under this
Section 2.05 shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Lenders. Following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such payment to the Lenders as their interests may appear in accordance with
this Agreement.

                  (b)      Maintenance of Loan Accounts by Lenders. Each Lender
shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing the indebtedness to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

                  (c)      Maintenance of Loan Accounts by Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the
amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type of each Loan made and the Interest
Period and Available Currency applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of each Letter
of Credit, the Letter of Credit Liabilities applicable thereto and each
Revolving Lender's participation interest therein, (iii) the amount of any
principal, interest and Fees due and payable or to become due and payable from
the Borrower to each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereunder, (iv) the amount of
any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and
each Lender's and each Issuing Bank's share thereof.

                  (d)      Prima Facie Evidence. The entries made in the
accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 2.05
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided, however,
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such
accounts or any error therein or an inconsistency between such accounts of a
Lender and the accounts of the Administrative Agent shall not in any manner
affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with
their terms.

         Section 2.06. Interest on Loans; Margin and Fees.

                  (a)      Fixed Rate. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.07, the Loans comprising each Fixed Rate Borrowing shall bear interest
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
days) at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Fixed Rate for the Interest
Period and Available Currency in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable
Margin from time to time in effect.

                  (b)      Alternate Base Rate. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.07, the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be, for periods during which the Alternate Base
Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate and 360 days for other periods
and including for all calculations the first day of any period but excluding the
last) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (c)      Payment of Interest. Interest on each Loan shall be
payable on each Interest Payment Date applicable to such Loan except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. Interest on Loans, the principal amount of
which is denominated in an Available Currency, shall be paid in that Available
Currency. The applicable Fixed Rate or Alternate Base Rate shall be determined
by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error; provided that the Administrative Agent shall, upon request,
provide to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such determination.

                  (d)      Determination of Applicable Margin. The Applicable
Margin identified in this Section 2.06 and the Facility Fee Percentage
identified in Section 2.04 shall be defined and determined as follows:

                  "Applicable Margin" means (i) during the period commencing on
         the Effective Date and ending on but not including the first Adjustment
         Date (as defined below), 1.75% per annum and (ii) during each period
         from and including one Adjustment Date to but excluding the next
         Adjustment Date (herein a "Calculation Period"), the percent per annum
         set forth in the table below under the heading "Margin" opposite the
         Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio which corresponds to the Debt to Adjusted
         EBITDA Ratio set forth in, and as calculated in accordance with, the
         applicable Compliance Certificate.

                  "Facility Fee Percentage" means (1) during the period
         commencing on the Effective Date and ending on but not including the
         first Adjustment Date, 0.50% per annum and (2) during each Calculation
         Period, the percent per annum set forth in the table below under the
         heading "Facility Fee Percentage" opposite the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA
         Ratio which corresponds to the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio set forth
         in, and as calculated in accordance with, the applicable Compliance
         Certificate.

Upon delivery of the Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section 5.18(g) in
connection with the financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
required to be delivered pursuant to Sections 5.18(a) and (b), commencing with
such Compliance Certificate delivered with respect to the fiscal quarter ending
on September 30, 2003, the Applicable Margin (for Interest Periods commencing
after the applicable Adjustment Date) and the Facility Fee Percentage shall
automatically be adjusted in accordance with the Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio
set forth therein and the table set forth above, such automatic adjustment to
take effect as of the first Business Day after the receipt by the Agent of the
related Compliance Certificate pursuant to Section 5.18(g) (each such Business
Day when such margin or fees change pursuant to this sentence or the next
following sentence, herein an "Adjustment Date"). If the Borrower fails to
deliver such Compliance Certificate which so sets forth the Debt to Adjusted
EBITDA Ratio within the period of time required by Section 5.18(g): (i) the
Applicable Margin (for Interest Periods commencing after the applicable
Adjustment Date) shall automatically be adjusted to 2.50% per annum; and (ii)
the Facility Fee Percentage shall automatically be adjusted to 0.500% per annum,
such automatic adjustments to take effect as of the first Business Day after the
last day on which the Borrower was required to deliver the applicable Compliance
Certificate in accordance with Section 5.18(g) and to remain in effect until
subsequently adjusted in accordance herewith upon the delivery of a Compliance
Certificate.

         Section 2.07. Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration
or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to time from the
Administrative Agent pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed as provided in Section
2.06(b)) equal to: (a) with respect to the ABR Loans, the rate otherwise
applicable thereto as determined in accordance with Section 2.06 plus 2%; (b)
with respect to Fixed Rate Loans, until the end of the Interest period
applicable thereto, the rate otherwise applicable thereto as determined in
accordance with Section 2.06 plus 2% and after the end of the Interest Period
therefor: (i) if such Fixed Rate Loan is a Dollar Loan, the Alternate Base Rate
plus 2% and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Loan is a Euro Loan or Australian Dollar
Loan, the rate per annum applicable to Fixed Rate Loans and the applicable
currency with a one month Interest Period as the same may change each day plus
2%; (c) with respect to other amounts payable in Euro or Australian Dollars
hereunder, the rate determined pursuant to (b)(ii) immediately above; and (d)
with respect to other amounts, the Alternate Base Rate plus 2%.

         Section 2.08. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Fixed Rate
Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have determined (i) that deposits of
the applicable Available Currency in the principal amounts of the Fixed Rate
Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the market
utilized to determine the applicable Fixed Rate or (ii) that reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Fixed Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as
soon as practicable thereafter, give telecopy notice of such determination to
the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination under
clauses (i) or (ii) above and after notice thereof shall have been provided to
the Borrower, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and
the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist,
any request by the Borrower for a Fixed Rate Borrowing of the affected Type
pursuant to Section 2.03 shall be deemed to be a request for a Dollar ABR
Borrowing under the applicable requested facility (i.e., either Swingline or
Revolver). In the event the Swingline Lender notifies the Administrative Agent
that the rates at which deposits of the applicable Available Currency are being
offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender of making
or maintaining the applicable Fixed Rate Loans during such Interest Period, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of such notice and until the
Swingline Lender shall have advised the Administrative Agent that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, any request by the
Borrower for a Fixed Rate Borrowing of the affected Type and Available Currency
shall be deemed a request for a Dollar ABR Swingline Borrowing. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be made in good faith
and shall

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 23

<PAGE>

be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that the Administrative Agent,
shall, upon request, provide to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such determination.

         Section 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

                  (a)      Termination on Maturity Date. The commitment of the
Swingline Lender under Section 2.01 to make Swingline Loans, and the Commitments
of the Revolving Lenders shall automatically be terminated on the Maturity Date.
Such commitments may also terminate as provided in Section 2.10(c) and Article
6.

                  (b)      Optional Termination or Reduction. Upon at least
three Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower may, at any time, in whole permanently terminate, or, from
time to time, in part permanently reduce, the Total Commitment; provided,
however, that (i) each partial reduction of the Total Commitment shall be in an
integral multiple of $5,000,000 and in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000;
(ii) no such termination or reduction shall be made which would reduce the Total
Commitment to an amount less than $50,000,000, unless the result of such
termination or reduction is to reduce the Total Commitment to $0; and (iii) no
such termination or reduction shall reduce the Total Commitment below the then
outstanding Revolving Exposures. The Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.09(b) and of each
Lender's portion of any such termination or reduction of the Total Commitment.
Upon the termination of the Total Commitment, the commitment of the Swingline
Lender under Section 2.01 shall also terminate.

                  (c)      Allocation of Reduction. Each reduction in the Total
Commitment hereunder shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Commitments. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Lenders, on the date of each termination or reduction of
the Total Commitment, the Facility Fees on the amount of the Commitments so
terminated or reduced accrued through the date of such termination or reduction.

         Section 2.10. Prepayment Including Prepayment as a Result of a Change
of Control.

                  (a)      Optional Prepayment. The Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in
part, upon giving telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by
telecopy) to the Administrative Agent: (i) before 11:00 a.m., New York, New York
time, three Business Days prior to prepayment, in the case of Fixed Rate Loans
which prepayment shall be accompanied by any amount owed under Section 8.05(b),
and (ii) before 11:00 a.m., New York, New York time, one Business Day prior to
prepayment, in the case of ABR Loans; provided, however, that each partial
prepayment shall be in an amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and
not less than $5,000,000. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment
date and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be
prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such
Borrowing (or portion thereof) by the amount stated therein on the date stated
therein.

                  (b)      Required Prepayment upon Reduction or Termination of
Commitments. On the date of any termination or reduction of the Total Commitment
pursuant to Section 2.09, the Borrower shall pay or prepay so much of the
Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate Dollar Equivalent
outstanding principal amount of the Loans will not exceed the sum of the Total
Commitment minus all Letter of Credit Liabilities, after giving effect to such
termination or reduction.

                  (c)      Prepayment Offer Required as a Result of a Change of
Control. At least 15 Business Days and not more than 90 days prior to the
occurrence of any Change of Control, the Borrower will give written notice
thereof to each Lender. Such notice shall contain (i) an offer by the Borrower
to prepay, on the date of such Change of Control or, if such notice shall be
delivered less than 35 days prior to the date of such

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 24

<PAGE>

Change of Control, on the date 35 days after the date of such notice (the
"Prepayment Date"), all Loans made by each Lender, together with interest
accrued thereon to the Prepayment Date and all other liquidated obligations owed
to such Lender under the terms hereof, (ii) the estimated amount of accrued
interest, showing in reasonable detail the calculation thereof and (iii) the
Borrower's estimate of the date on which such Change of Control shall occur.
Said offer shall be deemed to lapse as to any such Lender which has not replied
affirmatively thereto in writing within 35 days of the giving of such notice. As
soon as practicable (and in any event at least 24 hours) prior to such Change of
Control, the Borrower shall give written confirmation of the date thereof to
each such Lender that has affirmatively replied to the notice given pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 2.10(c). Borrower shall, on the Prepayment
Date, prepay to each Lender that has affirmatively replied to the notice given
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.10(c), all Loans then held by
such Lender together with accrued interest thereon and all other liquidated
obligations owed to such Lender under the terms hereof. Thereupon, each Lender
that shall have received such prepayment shall have no further obligation to
make Revolving Loans or participate in Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit
whether outstanding as of the Prepayment Date or made or issued after the
Prepayment Date and the Total Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of each
such Lender's Commitment.

         For the purposes of this Section 2.10(c), a "Change of Control" shall
be deemed to occur if any New Owner shall acquire beneficial ownership of shares
in the Borrower having Voting Rights pertaining thereto which would allow such
New Owner to elect more members of the Board of Directors than could be elected
by the exercise of all Voting Rights pertaining to shares in the Borrower then
owned beneficially by the Norris Family. As used in this Section 2.10(c):

                  "Voting Rights" pertaining to shares of a corporation means
the rights to cast votes for the election of directors of such corporation in
ordinary circumstances (without consideration of voting rights which exist only
in the event of contingencies).

                  "Norris Family" means all persons who are lineal descendants
of D.W. Norris (by birth or adoption), all spouses of such descendants, all
estates of such descendants or spouses which are in the course of
administration, all trusts for the benefit of such descendants or spouses, and
all corporations or other entities in which, directly or indirectly, such
descendants or spouses (either alone or in conjunction with other such
descendants or spouses) have the right, whether by ownership of stock or other
equity interests or otherwise, to direct the management and policies of such
corporations or other entities (each such person, spouse, estate, trust,
corporation or entity being referred to herein as a "member" of the Norris
Family). In addition, so long as any employee stock ownership plan exercises its
Voting Rights in the same manner as members of the Norris Family (exclusive of
employee stock ownership plans) who have a majority of the Voting Rights
exercised by all such members of the Norris Family, such employee stock
ownership plan shall be deemed a member of the Norris Family.

                  "New Owner" means any Person (other than a member of the
Norris Family), or any syndicate or group of Persons (exclusive of all members
of the Norris Family) which would be deemed a "person" for the purposes of
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, who directly or indirectly acquires shares in
the Borrower.

                  (d)      Outstandings in Excess of Commitments. If on any date
of a Borrowing, any Interest Payment Date, any date of the issuance of a Letter
of Credit, any date when a Compliance Certificate is delivered under Section
5.18(g) or any other date selected by the Administrative Agent, the (i)
Revolving Exposures exceed the Total Commitments; (ii) the Australian Dollar
Loans exceed a Dollar Equivalent amount of $25,000,000; or (iii) the Euro Loans
exceed a Dollar Equivalent amount of $25,000,000, then, in each case, Borrower
shall promptly repay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the
applicable excess.

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 25

                  (e)      Breakage Costs and Interest. All prepayments under
this Section 2.10 shall be subject to Section 8.05 but otherwise without premium
or penalty. All prepayments under this Section 2.10 shall be accompanied by
accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of payment.

         Section 2.11. Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances.

                  (a)      Change in Law; Increased Cost. Notwithstanding any
other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement any change in
applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or administration thereof
by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof (whether or not having the force of law) shall change the basis of
taxation of payments to any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder (except for
changes in respect of taxes on the overall net income of such Issuing Bank or
such Lender or its lending office imposed by the jurisdiction in which its
principal executive office or lending office is located), or shall result in the
imposition, modification or applicability of any reserve, special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or
credit extended by any Lender or any Issuing Bank, or shall result in the
imposition on any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any interbank market utilized to
determine the rate hereunder or any other condition affecting this Agreement,
such Lender's Commitment, any Loan made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit
or participation interest therein, and the result of any of the foregoing shall
be to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of making or
maintaining any Loan or issuing, maintaining or participating in any Letter of
Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an
amount deemed by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to be material, then the
Borrower shall, upon receipt of the notice and certificate provided for in
Section 2.11(c), promptly pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable,
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b)      Capital Adequacy. If any Lender or any Issuing Bank
shall have determined that the adoption after the date hereof of any other law,
rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any
of the foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of any of the
foregoing by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or any Issuing Bank or any
Lender's or any Issuing Bank's holding company with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the
capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, such Lender's Commitment, the Loans made by such
Lender pursuant hereto, or any Letter of Credit or participation interest
therein to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's
or Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's
policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing
Bank to be material, then from time to time such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank for any such reduction suffered will
be paid by the Borrower to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable.

                  (c)      Delivery of Certificate. A certificate of each
affected party setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to
compensate such party or its holding company as specified in paragraph (a) or
(b) above, as the case may be, and containing an explanation in reasonable
detail of the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been determined,
shall be delivered to the Borrower, and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. The Borrower shall pay each Lender and each Issuing Bank, as applicable,
the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 10 days
after its receipt of the same. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank shall give
prompt notice to the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring
after the date hereof, that it has determined will require compensation by the
Borrower

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 26

<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that failure by such Lender or
Issuing Bank to give such notice shall not constitute a waiver of such party's
right to demand compensation hereunder.

                  (d)      No Waiver. Failure on the part of any party to demand
compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or
receivable or reduction in return on capital of the type described in paragraph
(a) or (b) of this Section 2.11 with respect to any period shall not constitute
a waiver of such party's right to demand compensation with respect to such
period or any other period; provided, however, that neither any Lender nor any
Issuing Bank shall be entitled to compensation under this Section 2.11 for any
costs incurred or reductions suffered with respect to any date unless it shall
have notified the Borrower that it will demand compensation for such costs or
reductions under paragraph (c) above not more than 90 days after the later of
(i) such date and (ii) the date on which it shall have become aware of such
costs or reductions. The protection of this Section shall be available to each
Lender and each Issuing Bank regardless of any possible contention of the
invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other
change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed.

                  (e)      Change of Lending Office. Each Lender and each
Issuing Bank agrees that it will designate a different lending or issuing
office, as applicable, if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce
the amount of, compensation payable under this Section 2.11 and will not, in its
reasonable judgment, be disadvantageous to its interests.

         Section 2.12. Change in Legality; Unavailability of Available Currency.

                  (a)      Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof
by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation
thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Fixed Rate
Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to
any Fixed Rate Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

                           (i)      declare that the applicable Fixed Rate Loans
will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request for
such a Fixed Rate Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request
for an ABR Dollar Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn
(any Lender delivering such a declaration hereby agreeing to withdraw such
declaration promptly upon determining that such event of illegality no longer
exists); and

                           (ii)     require that all outstanding Fixed Rate
Loans affected by the illegality made by it be either (A), if such Loans are
Dollar Loans, Converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Fixed Rate Loans
shall be automatically Converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such
notice as provided below, or (B) repaid if such Fixed Rate Loan is a Euro Loan
or an Australian Dollar Loan.

                  In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under
clauses (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would
otherwise have been applied to repay the affected Fixed Rate Loans that would
have been made by such Lender or the Converted Fixed Rate Loans of such Lender
shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of,
or resulting from the Conversion of, such Fixed Rate Loans. For purposes of this
Section 2.12 (a), a notice by any Lender shall be effective as to each Fixed
Rate Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently
applicable to such Fixed Rate Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be
effective on the date of receipt.

                  (b)      Unavailability of Foreign Currency Loans.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for the Swingline Lender to make or maintain any Euro Loan or Australian Dollar
Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 27

<PAGE>

hereby with respect to any such Loan or in the event that there shall occur any
material adverse change in national or international financial, political or
economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would
in the opinion of the Swingline Lender make it impracticable for Swingline Loans
to be denominated in either the Euro or Australian Dollars, then, by written
notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender
may:

                           (i)      declare that such Loans will not thereafter
be made, whereupon any request for such a Borrowing shall be deemed a request
for a Dollar ABR Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn
(the Swingline Lender agreeing to withdraw such declaration promptly upon
determining that the applicable event or condition no longer exists); and

                           (ii)     require that all outstanding Euro Loans or
Australian Dollar Loans so affected be repaid.

         Section 2.13. Pro Rata Treatment. Each Borrowing, each payment or
prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans,
each payment of the Facility Fees, each Conversion or Continuation of any Loans,
and each reduction of the Total Commitment, shall be allocated pro rata among
the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if such
Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the
respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans) except: (a) as required
under Sections 2.12, 2.15 and 2.17 or as otherwise expressly provided herein;
(b) with respect to Swingline Borrowings and Swingline Loans; and (c) if
interest shall accrue on any portion of a Borrowing held by a Lender at a rate
different from the rate applicable to the other Lenders, payment and
distribution of interest shall be based on the respective accrual rates
applicable to such Borrowing.

         Section 2.14. Sharing of Setoffs. Subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement which shall have precedence over any conflicting
provisions in this Section 2.14, each Lender agrees that if it shall, through
the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim, or pursuant to
a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other
security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received
by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law
or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary)
in respect of any amounts due hereunder as a result of which the unpaid
principal portion of such amount shall be proportionately less than the unpaid
principal portion of such amount owed to any other Lender, it shall be deemed
simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall
promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in
such amounts of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the obligations owed by the Borrower hereunder and participations in such
obligations held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all obligations owed by the Borrower hereunder then
outstanding as the principal amount of such obligations prior to such exercise
of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal
amount of all such obligations outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's
lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided, however, that, if any
such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section
2.14 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such
purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such
recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without
interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and
agrees that any Lender holding a participation in the obligations owed hereunder
deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's
lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the
Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a
Loan in the amount of such participation.

         Section 2.15. Payments. The Borrower shall make each payment (including
principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts
hereunder) from an account in the United States (or such other account in such
other jurisdiction as the Administrative Agent may designate for such purpose)
not later than 12:00 noon, New York, New York time, on the date when due in the
applicable Available Currency to the

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 28

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent at its offices at 712 Main Street, Houston, TX 77002 or, in
the case of payments to be made directly to another party hereto in accordance
with the terms hereof, to such party as such party shall direct, in each case,
in immediately available funds. All payments made by the Borrower shall be made
without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or
setoff. Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise
would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on
the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case
be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable. Payments of
principal and interest on or in respect of the Swingline Loans received by the
Administrative Agent shall be paid to the Swingline Lender except that any
amounts received in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline
Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly
remitted to the Revolving Lenders that shall have funded their participation
interests therein and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear.
Payments made in respect of the LC Disbursements received by the Administrative
Agent shall be paid to the applicable Issuing Bank except that any amounts
received in respect of any LC Disbursement after receipt by such Issuing Bank of
the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to
the Revolving Lenders that shall have funded their participation interests
therein and to the applicable Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear.

         Section 2.16. Taxes

                  (a)      Payment of Taxes; Gross Up. Any and all payments of
principal and interest on any Borrowings, or of any Fees or indemnity or expense
reimbursements by the Borrower under any Loan Document and any other payments by
Borrower or any Obligated Party under the Loan Documents ("Borrower Payments")
shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.15, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all current or future federal, state, local and other
governmental taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and
all liabilities with respect to the Borrower Payments, but only to the extent
reasonably attributable to the Borrower Payments, excluding (i) income taxes
imposed on the net income of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any
Lender (or any transferee or assignee thereof, including a participation holder
(any such entity a "Transferee")) and (ii) franchise taxes imposed on the net
income of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender (or
Transferee), in each case by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such party
(or Transferee) is organized or doing business through offices or branches
located therein, or any political subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities,
collectively or individually, "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender (or any Transferee), (i)
the sum payable shall be increased by the amount (an "additional amount")
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16) such party (or
Transferee) (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b)      Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law any
current or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or
from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to,
any Loan Document ("Other Taxes").

                  (c)      Tax Indemnification. The Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender (or Transferee thereof)
for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes with respect to Borrower Payments
paid to such party and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting
forth and containing an explanation in reasonable detail of the manner in which
such amount

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 29

<PAGE>

shall have been determined and the amount of such payment or liability prepared
by the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender, absent manifest error,
shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such indemnification
shall be made within 30 days after the date the applicable party makes written
demand therefor.

                  (d)      Tax Refund. If the Administrative Agent, an Issuing
Bank or a Lender (or Transferee) shall become aware that it is entitled to claim
a refund from a Governmental Authority in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes as to
which it has been indemnified by the Borrower, or with respect to which the
Borrower has paid additional amounts, pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall
promptly notify the Borrower of the availability of such refund claim and shall,
within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Borrower, make a claim to such
Governmental Authority for such refund at the Borrower's expense. If such party
receives a refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the
preceding sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has
been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower had paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall within 30 days from
the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower
under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all of its out - of - pocket expenses and without interest
(other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund); provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the request of such
party, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus penalties,
interest or other charges) under this Section 2.16(d) in the event the party is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

                  (e)      Tax Receipts. As soon as practicable, but in any
event within 30 days, after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes by
the Borrower to the relevant Governmental Authority, the Borrower will deliver
to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.01, the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing payment thereof.

                  (f)      Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any
other agreement contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in
this Section 2.16 shall survive the payment in full of all Revolving Exposure
and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

                  (g)      Tax Withholding Exemptions. Each Lender (or
Transferee) that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the
United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia (a "Non - U.S.
Lender") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies
of the applicable United States Internal Revenue Service Form, properly
completed and duly executed by such Non - U.S. Lender claiming complete
exemption from, or reduced rate of, United States Federal withholding tax on
payments by the Borrower under this Agreement. Such forms shall be delivered by
each Non - U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this
Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation holder, on or
before the date such participation holder becomes a Transferee hereunder) and on
or before the date, if any, such Non - U.S. Lender changes its applicable
lending office by designating a different lending office (a "New Lending
Office"). In addition, each Non - U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly
upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non
- U.S. Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.16(g), a
Non - U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this
Section 2.16(g) that such Non - U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

                  (h)      Failure to Deliver Forms. The Borrower shall not be
required to indemnify any Non - U.S. Lender (including any Transferee), or to
pay any additional amounts to any Non - U.S. Lender (including any Transferee),
in respect of federal, state, local or other governmental withholding tax
pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the extent that (i) the obligation to
withhold amounts with respect to federal, state, local or other governmental
withholding tax existed on the date such Non - U.S. Lender became a party to
this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation holder,
on the date such participation holder became a Transferee hereunder), or, with
respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the date such Non -

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 30

<PAGE>

U.S. Lender designated such New Lending Office with respect to a Loan; provided,
however, that this clause (h) shall not apply to any Transferee or New Lending
Office that becomes a Transferee or New Lending Office as a result of an
assignment, participation, transfer or designation made at the request of the
Borrower; and provided further, however, that this clause (h) shall not apply to
the extent the indemnity payment or additional amounts any Transferee, or Lender
(or Transferee) through a New Lending Office, would be entitled to receive
(without regard to this clause (h)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or
additional amounts that the Person making the assignment, participation or
transfer to such Transferee, or Lender (or Transferee) making the designation of
such New Lending Office, would have been entitled to receive in the absence of
such assignment, participation, transfer or designation or (ii) the obligation
to pay such additional amounts or such indemnity payments would not have arisen
but for a failure by such Non - U.S. Lender (including any Transferee) to comply
with the provisions of paragraph (g) above and (i) below.

                  (i)      Mitigation by Lenders. The Administrative Agent, any
Issuing Bank or any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any indemnity payment or
additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall use reasonable
efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any
certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or to
change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a
filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such
indemnity payment or additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would
not, in the good faith determination of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing
Bank or such Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to its
interests.

                  (j)      No Requirement to Deliver Tax Returns. Nothing
contained in this Section 2.16 shall require the Administrative Agent, any
Issuing Bank or any Lender (or Transferee) to make available to the Borrower any
of its tax returns (or any other information) that it deems to be confidential
or proprietary subject however to the provisions of Section 8.14.

         Section 2.17. Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances. In
the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice or certificate pursuant
to Section 2.11 or 2.12, or the Borrower shall be required to make additional
payments to any Lender under Section 2.16, the Borrower shall have the right, at
its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to
require such Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with
and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.04) all such Lender's
interests, rights and obligations contained hereunder to another financial
institution approved by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) which shall assume such
obligations; provided that (i) no such assignment shall conflict with any law,
rule or regulation or order of any Governmental Authority; and (ii) the assignee
or the Borrower, as the case may be, shall pay to the affected Lender in
immediately available funds on the date of such assignment, the principal of and
interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and
all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder.

         Section 2.18. Payments by Administrative Agent to the Lenders. Any
payment received by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan
Document for the account of a Lender or an Issuing Bank shall be paid to such
party by 4:00 p.m. New York, New York time on (a) the Business Day the payment
is received in immediately available funds, if such payment is received by 11:00
a.m. New York, New York time and (b) if such payment is received after 11:00
a.m. New York, New York time, on the next Business Day.

         Section 2.19. Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of letters of credit
(each such letter of credit, along with each Existing Letter of Credit, herein a
"Letter of Credit") for its own account and for its or a Subsidiary's benefit,
payable in Dollars (or if then approved by an Issuing Bank, in another Available
Currency) in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time on and after the date

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 31

<PAGE>

hereof until the earlier of five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date or the
termination of the Commitments hereunder. If the Borrower requests JPMorgan to
issue a Letter of Credit, JPMorgan agrees to issue the Letter of Credit subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, those contained in
clause (a) below and those contained in Section 4.01) and provided that (i) the
terms and provisions of such Letter of Credit are satisfactory to JPMorgan and
otherwise comply with the terms hereof, (ii) such Letter of Credit supports a
transaction acceptable to JPMorgan and (iii) such Letter of Credit is issued
pursuant to such documentation as JPMorgan may require. The Borrower may request
any Issuing Bank to issue a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions
of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to
any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                  (a)      Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension;
Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable
Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent
(reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and
specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be
a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which
shall comply with paragraph (b) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of
Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter
of Credit. If requested by an Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a
letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form (or in such
other form as may be mutually agreed between the Borrower and the Issuing Bank)
in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall
be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to
represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (i) the Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not exceed a
Dollar Equivalent amount equal to $100,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving
Exposures of all Lenders shall not exceed the Total Commitment.

                  (b)      Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire
at or prior to the close of business on the date that is five Business Days
prior to the Maturity Date.

                  (c)      Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
without any further action on the part of any Issuing Bank or the Lenders, each
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender
hereby acquires from each Issuing Bank, a participation in each Letter of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank equal to such Revolving Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, the Dollar Equivalent
amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by an
Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in
paragraph (d) of this Section in Dollars, or of any reimbursement payment
required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever; provided that (i) the
obligations of a Revolving Lender to fund its participation in a Letter of
Credit may be subject to avoidance by that Revolving Lender if (A) the
applicable Issuing Bank knew (or with the exercise of

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 32

<PAGE>

care should have known) that the conditions to the issuance of the Letter of
Credit were not satisfied or (B) the applicable Issuing Bank failed to exercise
care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under the
Letter of Credit complied with the terms thereof, and (ii) a Revolving Lender
shall not have an obligation to acquire or fund a participation in a Letter of
Credit if that obligation of the Revolving Lender has been terminated or
assigned to another Person in accordance with Section 2.10(c), Section 2.17 or
Section 8.04. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Bank (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), an Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care.

                  (d)      Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement in the currency in which it is denominated not later than 12:00
noon, New York, New York time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if
the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00
a.m., New York, New York time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been
received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than
12:00 noon, New York, New York time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York,
New York time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately
following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not
received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that the Borrower
may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request that such
payment be financed with a Loan in an equivalent amount in the applicable
Available Currency, and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to
make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Loan. If the
Borrower fails to make such reimbursement payment when due, the Administrative
Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the Dollar
Equivalent amount of the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof
and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of
such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the
Dollar Equivalent amount of its Applicable Percentage of the reimbursement
payment then due from the Borrower in Dollars, and the Administrative Agent
shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it
from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative
Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders
and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made
by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank
for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of a Loan as contemplated above)
shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation
to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                  (e)      Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their
respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason
of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any
payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 33

<PAGE>

transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or
relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
consequence arising from causes beyond the control of an Issuing Bank; provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from
liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to
consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the
Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower
that are caused by an Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining
whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply
with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), each Issuing Bank
shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In
furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (f)      Disbursement Procedures. An Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under one of its Letters of Credit. An Issuing
Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether it has
made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to
give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect
to any such LC Disbursement.

                  (g)      Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any
LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made in accordance with paragraph
(d) of this Section, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day
from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the
date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum
then applicable to ABR Loans or if the Available Currency applicable to such LC
Disbursement is either the Euro or Australian Dollars, at the rate per annum
applicable to Fixed Rate Loans applicable to such currency with a one month
Interest Period, as the same may change each day; provided that, if the Borrower
fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (d) of
this Section, then Section 2.07 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this
paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the
account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

         Section 2.20. Increase of Commitments. By written notice sent to the
Administrative Agent (which the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute
to the Lenders), the Borrower may request an increase of the Total Commitments:
(i) by an aggregate amount equal to any integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not
less than $10,000,000 and (ii) by an aggregate amount not to exceed $50,000,000;
provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (ii) the Total Commitments shall not have been reduced, nor shall
the Borrower have given notice of any such reduction under Section 2.09(b), and
(iii) the Total Commitments shall not previously have been increased pursuant to
this Section 2.20 more than three (3) times. If one or more of the Lenders is
not increasing its Commitment, then, with notice to the Administrative Agent and
the other Lenders, another one or more financial institutions, each as approved
by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (a "New Lender"), may commit to
provide an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the requested increase that
will not be provided by the existing Lenders (the "Increase Amount"); provided,
that the Commitment of each New Lender shall be at least $5,000,000 and the
maximum number of New Lenders shall be three (3). Upon receipt of notice from
the Administrative Agent to the Lenders and the

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 34

<PAGE>

Borrower that the Lenders, or sufficient Lenders and New Lenders, have agreed to
commit to an aggregate amount equal to the Increase Amount (or such lesser
amount as the Borrower shall agree, which shall be at least $10,000,000 and an
integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof), then: provided that no
Default or Event of Default exists at such time or after giving effect to the
requested increase, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
willing to increase their respective Commitments and the New Lenders (if any)
shall execute and deliver an Increased Commitment Supplement (herein so called)
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G. If all existing Lenders shall not have
provided their pro rata portion of the requested Increase Amount, the Loans will
not be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Applicable
Percentages determined hereunder. To remedy the foregoing, on the date of the
effectiveness of the Increased Commitment Supplement, the Revolving Lenders
shall make advances among themselves so that after giving effect thereto the
Revolving Loans will be held by the Revolving Lenders, pro rata in accordance
with the Applicable Percentages hereunder. The advances so made by each Lender
whose Applicable Percentage has increased as a result of the changes to the
Total Commitment shall be deemed to be a purchase of a corresponding amount of
the Loans of the Revolving Lender or Lenders whose Applicable Percentages have
decreased. The advances made under this Section 2.20 shall be ABR Loans made
under each Revolving Lender's Commitment. All advances made under this Section
2.20 shall be made through the Administrative Agent.

                                   ARTICLE 3.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Borrower represents and warrants to each of the Lenders and Issuing
Banks as follows:

         Section 3.01. Organization; Powers. Borrower (a) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has all requisite power and authority to
own its property and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, (c) is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction
where such qualification is required, except where the failure so to qualify
would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (d) has the corporate power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to borrow hereunder.

         Section 3.02. Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, the Borrowings
hereunder, the pledge of the stock of certain Subsidiaries under the Pledge
Agreement, the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and the other
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (collectively, the
"Transactions"): (a) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
and (b) will not (i) violate (A) any provision of any law, statute, rule or
regulation to which any Obligated Party is subject or of the certificate of
incorporation or other constituent documents or by - laws of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) any order of any Governmental Authority or (C) any
provision of any Material indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its
property is or may be bound (including the Senior Note Purchase Agreements and
the Indebtedness limitations set forth in any Senior Note Purchase Agreement),
(ii) be in conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with
notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any such indenture, agreement
or other instrument or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any property or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except
as contemplated by the Pledge Agreement.

         Section 3.03. Enforceability. This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms,
as such enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 35

<PAGE>

         Section 3.04. Governmental Approvals. No action, consent or approval
of, registration or filing with or other action by any Governmental Authority is
or will be required in connection with the Transactions, to the extent they
relate to the Borrower.

         Section 3.05. Organization and Ownership of Shares of Subsidiaries.

                  (a)      Schedule 3.05 is (except as noted therein) a complete
and correct list of the Borrower's Subsidiaries as of September 11, 2003
showing, as to each Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of
its organization, the percentage of Equity Interests owned by the Borrower and
each other Subsidiary, and specifying whether such Subsidiary is a Material
Subsidiary. Schedule 3.05A correctly sets forth the authorized, issued, and
outstanding Equity Interest of each Material Subsidiary and LGL Australia (US)
Inc. All of the outstanding Equity Interests of each Material Subsidiary and LGL
Australia (US) Inc. have been validly issued, are fully paid, and are
nonassessable. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
or rights (including preemptive rights) to acquire, and no outstanding
securities or instruments convertible into, any Equity Interest of any Material
Subsidiary or LGL Australia (US) Inc..

                  (b)      All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
similar Equity Interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 3.05 as being
owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Borrower or another Subsidiary free
and clear of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.13).

                  (c)      Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 3.05 is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than
those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other
power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own
or hold under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to
transact.

         Section 3.06. Financial Statements. The Borrower has delivered to some
or all of the Lenders copies of the financial statements of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 3.06. All of the financial statements listed on
Schedule 3.06 (including in each case the related schedules and notes) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates specified in such
Schedule and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
respective periods so specified and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set forth in the
notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to
normal year - end adjustments). Except as disclosed in the financial statements
listed in Schedule 3.06 or the most recently delivered financial statements
delivered in accordance with Section 5.18, since June 30, 2003, there has been
no change in the financial condition, operations, business, properties or
prospects of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries except changes that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the Borrower that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set
forth herein or in the financial statements listed in Schedule 3.06.

         Section 3.07. Litigation; Observance of Statutes and Orders.

                  (a)      There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or any property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in
any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental
Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 36

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default
under any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is
bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or
Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule
or regulation (including Environmental Laws) of any Governmental Authority,
which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.08. Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all
income tax returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and
have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other
taxes and assessments payable by them, to the extent such taxes and assessments
have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent, except for
any taxes and assessments (i) the amount of which is not individually or in the
aggregate Material or (ii) the amount, applicability or validity of which is
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has
established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. The Federal income tax
liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been determined by the
Internal Revenue Service and paid for all fiscal years up to and including the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1998.

         Section 3.09. Title to Property; Leases. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective Material
properties, including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited
balance sheet referred to in Section 3.06 or purported to have been acquired by
the Borrower or any Subsidiary after said date (except as sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and clear of
Liens prohibited by this Agreement, except for those defects in title and Liens
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. All Material leases are valid and subsisting and are in full force and
effect in all material respects.

         Section 3.10. Licenses, Permits, etc. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries
own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents,
copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that
are Material, without known conflict with the rights of others, except for those
conflicts that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.11. Compliance with ERISA.

                  (a)      The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have operated
and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for
such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or
the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or condition
has occurred or exists that would reasonably be expected to result in the
incurrence of any such liability by the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate, or in
the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of
ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions or to Section 401(a)(29) or
412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or Liens as would not be
individually or in the aggregate Material.

                  (b)      The present value of the aggregate accrued plan
benefit liabilities under each of the Plans that are subject to Title IV of
ERISA (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87 as of the end of such Plan's most
recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for
funding purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation report, did not
exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such
benefit liabilities by more than $3,000,000 in the case of any single Plan and
by more than $3,000,000 in the aggregate for all Plans.

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 37

                  (c)      The Borrower and its ERISA Affiliates have not
incurred withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal
liabilities) under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer
Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.

                  (d)      The expected post - retirement benefit obligation
(determined as of the last day of the Borrower's most recently ended fiscal year
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106,
without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by
Section 4980B of the Code) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries was
approximately $13,472,000 as of December 31, 2002.

         Section 3.12. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulation. The Borrower will
apply the proceeds of the Loans to refinance existing indebtedness, to make
acquisitions, for capital expenditures, for working capital and for other
general corporate purposes. The Letters of Credit shall be issued to support
transactions of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary
course of business. No part of the proceeds from the Loans will be used,
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock
within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board (12 CFR 221), or for the purpose
of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as
to involve the Borrower in a violation of Regulation X of the Board (12 CFR 224)
or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of the Board
(12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute more than 5% of the value of the
consolidated assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the Borrower does
not have any present intention that margin stock will constitute more than 5% of
the value of such assets. As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and
"purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said
Regulation U.

         Section 3.13. Existing Indebtedness. Except as described therein,
Schedule 3.13 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding
Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness of
Subsidiaries to the Borrower or to Wholly - Owned Subsidiaries) as of June 30,
2003, since which date there has been no Material change in the amounts,
interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the
Indebtedness of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is in default, and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in
the payment of any principal or interest on any Indebtedness of the Borrower or
such Subsidiary, and no event or condition exists with respect to any
Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary the outstanding principal amount
of which exceeds $3,000,000 in the aggregate that would permit (or that with
notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause
such Indebtedness to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before
its regularly scheduled dates of payment. To the knowledge of the Responsible
Officers of the Borrower, no event or condition exists with respect to any
Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary that would permit (or that with
notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause
such Indebtedness to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before
its regularly scheduled dates of payment.

         Section 3.14. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, etc. The use of the
proceeds of the Loans will not violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as
amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States
Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling
legislation or executive order relating thereto.

         Section 3.15. Status under Certain Statutes. Neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended,
the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, or the Federal Power Act, as amended.

         Section 3.16. No Material Misstatements. No report, financial statement
or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or omits or
will omit

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 38

<PAGE>

to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were or will be made, not
misleading.

         Section 3.17. Senior Debt. The Loans, the interest thereon, and the LC
Disbursements are "Senior Indebtedness" under the terms of the Subordinated
Notes.

                                   ARTICLE 4.

                                   ARTICLE 5.

                       AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS

         The Borrower agrees that, so long as any Lender has any Commitment
hereunder or any obligations to acquire or fund any participation in any
Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit or the Swingline Lender is obligated to make
Swingline Loans or JPMorgan is obligated to issue Letters of Credit hereunder or
any amount payable hereunder remains unpaid:

         Section 5.01. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to comply in all Material respects with all laws,
ordinances or governmental rules or regulations to which each of them is
subject, including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, and will obtain and
maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other
governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective
properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses.

         Section 5.02. Insurance. The Borrower will and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers,
insurance with respect to their respective properties and businesses against
such casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such
amounts (including deductibles, co - insurance and self - insurance, if adequate
reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is customary in the case of
entities of established reputations engaged in the same or a similar business
and similarly situated.

         Section 5.03. Maintenance of Properties and Lines of Business. The
Borrower will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain and keep, or
cause to be maintained and kept, their respective properties in good repair,
working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the
business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all
times; provided that this Section shall not prevent the Borrower or any
Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its
properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business
and the Borrower has concluded that such discontinuance would not result in a
Default or an Event of Default (as a result of a violation of Section 5.11 or
otherwise) and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Borrower will not and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to engage in any line of business other than such lines of business
in which it is presently engaged and those businesses reasonably related
thereto.

         Section 5.04. Payment of Taxes. The Borrower will and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to file all income tax or similar tax returns required to be
filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and
payable on such returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges,
or levies payable by any of them, to the extent such taxes and assessments have
become due and payable and before they have become delinquent, provided that
neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment if
the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by the Borrower or
such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings,
and the Borrower or a Subsidiary has established adequate reserves therefor in
accordance with GAAP on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.

         Section 5.05. Corporate Existence, etc. The Borrower will at all times
preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. Subject to
Sections 5.10 and 5.11, the Borrower will at all times preserve and keep in full

and franchises of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries necessary for the conduct of
their respective businesses.

         Section 5.06. Most Favored Lender Status. The Borrower will not and
will not permit any Subsidiary to enter into, assume or otherwise be bound or
obligated under any agreement creating or evidencing Indebtedness or any
agreement executed and delivered in connection with any Indebtedness containing
one or more Additional Covenants or Additional Defaults (as defined below),
unless this Agreement

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 41

<PAGE>

is cross - defaulted to such Indebtedness under the terms of clause (f) of
Article 6 or unless prior written consent to such agreement shall have been
obtained from the Required Lenders; provided, however, in the event the Borrower
or any Subsidiary shall enter into, assume or otherwise become bound by or
obligated under any such agreement without the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders, the terms of this Agreement shall, without any further action
on the part of the Borrower or any of the Lenders, be deemed to be amended
automatically to include each Additional Covenant and each Additional Default
contained in such agreement. The Borrower further covenants to promptly execute
and deliver at its expense an amendment to this Agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Required Lenders evidencing the amendment of this Agreement
to include such Additional Covenants and Additional Defaults, provided that the
execution and delivery of such amendment shall not be a precondition to the
effectiveness of such amendment as provided for in this Section 5.06, but shall
merely be for the convenience of the parties hereto.

         For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term "Additional Covenant"
means any affirmative or negative covenant or similar restriction applicable to
the Borrower or any Subsidiary (regardless of whether such provision is labeled
or otherwise characterized as a covenant) the subject matter of which either (A)
is similar to that of the covenants in Article 5 of this Agreement, but contains
one or more percentages, amounts or formulas that is more restrictive than those
set forth herein or more beneficial to the holder or holders of such other
Indebtedness (and such covenant or similar restriction shall be deemed an
"Additional Covenant" only to the extent that it is more restrictive or more
beneficial), or (B) is different from the subject matter of the covenants in
Article 5 of this Agreement; and (ii) the term "Additional Default" means any
provision which permits the holder of such Indebtedness to accelerate (with the
passage of time or giving of notice or both) the maturity thereof or otherwise
require the Borrower or any Subsidiary to purchase such Indebtedness prior to
the stated maturity of such Indebtedness and which either (A) is similar to the
Defaults and Events of Default contained in Article 6 of this Agreement, but
contains one or more percentages, amounts or formulas that is more restrictive
or has a shorter grace period than those set forth herein or is more beneficial
to the holder or holders of such other Indebtedness (and such provision shall be
deemed an "Additional Default" only to the extent that it is more restrictive,
has a shorter grace period or is more beneficial) or (B) is different from the
subject matter of the Defaults and Events of Default contained in Article 6 of
this Agreement; provided that the terms "Additional Covenant" and "Additional
Default" shall not include any of the following:

                  (a)      any covenants, representations, warranties or
defaults relating solely to the property securing any secured Indebtedness
permitted to be incurred after the date hereof; and

                  (b)      any covenants, representations, warranties or
defaults relating solely to a single purpose entity involved in an asset
securitization transaction permitted hereby.

         Section 5.07. Covenant to Guarantee and Secure Loans Equally.

                  (a)      If any Subsidiary of the Borrower shall guarantee the
obligations of the Borrower under the Senior Note Purchase Agreements or any
other agreement creating or evidencing Indebtedness of the Borrower, the
Borrower shall cause to be made effective provision whereby the Loans and other
obligations under the Loan Documents will be guaranteed equally and ratably with
any and all other obligations thereby guaranteed, with the documentation for
such guarantee to be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Lenders. Any
violation of Section 5.12 will constitute an Event of Default, whether or not
provision is made for an equal and ratable guarantee pursuant to this Section
5.07.

                  (b)      If the Borrower shall create, assume or permit to
exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets, or permit any Subsidiary to
create, assume or permit to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than those Liens permitted by the
provisions of Section 5.13, the Borrower shall make or cause to be made
effective provision whereby the Loans and other obligations under the Loan
Documents will be secured equally and ratably with any and all other

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, Page 42

<PAGE>

obligations thereby secured, with the documentation for such security to be
reasonably satisfactory to the Required Lenders and, in any such case, the Loans
and such other obligations shall have the benefit, to the fullest extent that,
and with such priority as, the holders thereof may be entitled under applicable
law, of an equitable Lien on such property. Any violation of Section 5.13 will
constitute an Event of Default, whether or not provision is made for an equal
and ratable Lien pursuant to this Section 5.07.

         Section 5.08. Environmental Matters.

                  (a)      The Borrower will and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to comply in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws if, individually or in the aggregate, failure to comply
therewith could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or results of operations of the Borrower or the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                  (b)      The Borrower will not and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to cause or allow any Hazardous Substance to be present at any time
on, in, under or above any real property or any part thereof in which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary has a direct interest (including ownership thereof or
any arrangement for the lease, rental or other use thereof, or the retention of
any mortgage or security interest therein or thereon), except in a manner and to
an extent that is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws or that will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or results of operations of the Borrower or the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         Section 5.09. Transactions with Affiliates. The Borrower will not
permit any Subsidiary to enter into directly or indirectly any Material
transaction or Material group of related transactions (including the purchase,
lease, sale or exchange of properties of any kind or the rendering of any
service) with any Affiliate (other than the Borrower or another Subsidiary),
except pursuant to the reasonable requirements of the Borrower's or such
Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to
the Borrower or such Subsidiary than would be obtainable in a comparable arm's -
length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

         Section 5.10. Merger, Consolidation, etc. The Borrower will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary to, consolidate with or merge with or into any
other Person or permit any other Person to merge or consolidate with it or
convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets in a single
transaction or series of related transactions to any Person or dissolve or
liquidate; except that if, at the time thereof and immediately after giving
effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing: (i) a Domestic Subsidiary may merge into the Borrower or another
Domestic Subsidiary that is Wholly-Owned; provided that in any such merger
transaction involving the Borrower, the Borrower shall be the surviving Person;
(ii) any Foreign Subsidiary may merge into another Foreign Subsidiary that is
Wholly - Owned (other than the Insurance Subsidiary); (iii) Borrower may merge
with another Person in an acquisition permitted by Section 5.23 if the Borrower
is the surviving Person; (iv) any Subsidiary may merge with another Person in an
acquisition permitted by Section 5.23 if such Subsidiary is the surviving Person
or if the surviving Person becomes a Subsidiary and the Borrower or such Person
complies with the obligations hereunder applicable to new Material Subsidiaries
to the extent applicable to such surviving Person; (v) the Borrower and any
Subsidiary may make Transfers permitted by Section 5.11; and (vi) any Subsidiary
who has transferred all of its assets in a transaction permitted by Section 5.11
may thereafter dissolve or liquidate; provided, that in the case of any of the
transactions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) which would
involve or result in a Change of Control, the Borrower shall have complied with
Section 2.10.

         Section 5.11. Sale of Assets, etc. The Borrower will not, and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any Transfer provided that the foregoing
restriction does not apply to a Transfer if:

                  (a)      the property that is the subject of such Transfer
constitutes either (i) inventory held for sale, or (ii) equipment, fixtures,
supplies or materials no longer required in the operation of the business of the
Borrower or such Subsidiary or that is obsolete, and, in the case of any
Transfer described in clause (i) or (ii), such Transfer is in the ordinary
course of business (each such Transfer, an "Ordinary Course Transfer"); or

                  (b)      such Transfer is from

                           (i)      a Domestic Subsidiary to the Borrower or

                           (ii)     a Foreign Subsidiary to the Borrower or

                           (iii)    the Borrower to a Material Subsidiary that
is a Domestic Subsidiary and Wholly - Owned; or

                           (iv)     the Borrower or a Domestic Subsidiary to any

herein an "Intergroup Transfer"); or

                  (c)      such Transfer is not an Ordinary Course Transfer or

payable, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and
all other liabilities of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become forthwith
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest, notice of intent to
accelerate, notice of acceleration or any other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived, anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided that in the case of any event described in paragraph
(g) or (h) above with respect to any Obligated Party, all the Commitments of the
Lenders, the commitment of the Swingline Lender to make Swingline Loans and the
agreement of the Issuing Banks hereunder to issue Letters of Credit shall
automatically terminate and the principal amount of all Borrowings and all
reimbursement obligations for LC Disbursements then outstanding, together with
accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities
of the Obligated Parties accrued under the Loan Documents shall automatically
become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest, notice of intent
to accelerate, notice of acceleration or any other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein to
the contrary notwithstanding. In addition to the other rights and remedies that

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
JPMorgan is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Banks and the appointment of JPMorgan as administrative
agent under the Prior Credit Agreement is hereby confirmed and continued. Each
of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or Issuing
Bank and to exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms and provisions of any Loan Document, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders and the
Issuing Banks, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on
behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, as applicable, all payments of
principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders
and the Issuing Banks hereunder or under the Subsidiary Guaranty or from the
Collateral Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, and promptly to distribute
to each Lender and each Issuing Bank its share of each payment so received; (b)
to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders and each of the Issuing Banks to
the Borrower of any Event of Default of which the Administrative Agent has
actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; (c) to
distribute to each Lender and each Issuing Bank copies of all notices, financial
statements and other materials delivered by the Borrower pursuant to any Loan
Document as received by the Administrative Agent and (d) to execute and deliver
the Intercreditor Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
F on its behalf and bind it to the terms thereof as if it were a direct party
thereto.

         Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be
liable as such for any action taken or omitted by any of them except for its or
his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct, or be responsible for any
statement, warranty or representation herein or the contents of any document
delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any
inquiry concerning the performance or observance by any Obligated Party of any
of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan
Document. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders or
the Issuing Banks for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability
or effectiveness of any Loan Document; provided that the foregoing exclusion
shall not have the effect of releasing the Administrative Agent from its stated
responsibilities herein to receive executed agreements, documents and
instruments on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks. The Administrative
Agent may deem and treat the Lender which makes any Loan or participates in any
Swingline Loan or in the obligation to reimburse the Issuing Banks for any LC
Disbursement as the holder of the indebtedness resulting therefrom for all
purposes hereof until it shall have received notice from such Lender, given as
provided herein, of the transfer thereof. The Administrative Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance
with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders and, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action or
inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders and Issuing Banks.
The Administrative Agent shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be
entitled to rely on any instrument or document believed by it in good faith to
be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or
Persons. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall
have any responsibility to any Obligated Party on account of the failure of or
delay in performance or breach by any Lender or any Issuing Bank of any of its
obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in
performance or breach by any Lender or any Issuing Bank or any Obligated Party
of any of their respective obligations under any Loan Document to which they are
a party. The Administrative Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder by or
through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of
legal counsel selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder and
shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel.

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, Page 59

<PAGE>

         The Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby acknowledge that the
Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action
permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of any Loan Document
unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

         Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Administrative Agent who must be acceptable to the Borrower and shall be
selected from the Lenders unless no Lender agrees to accept such appointment. If
no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, no approval
of the Borrower obtained and such successor shall not have accepted such
appointment, all within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate
of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 8.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

         With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder and Letters of Credit
issued hereunder, the Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity as a
Lender, the Swingline Lender and an Issuing Bank and not as Administrative Agent
shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender or Issuing Bank and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
act as collateral agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent.

         Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative Agent, on
demand, in the amount of its Applicable Percentage of any expenses incurred for
the benefit of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks in its role as Administrative
Agent, including reasonable counsel fees and compensation of agents and
employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing
Banks, which shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower AND (II) TO
INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND ANY OF ITS RELATED
PARTIES, ON DEMAND, IN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH APPLICABLE PERCENTAGE, FROM AND
AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, TAXES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES,
ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES OR DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED ON, INCURRED BY OR ASSERTED AGAINST IT IN
ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY LOAN
DOCUMENT OR ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED BY IT UNDER ANY SUCH DOCUMENTS TO THE
EXTENT THE SAME SHALL NOT HAVE BEEN REIMBURSED BY THE BORROWER (INCLUDING ALL
LIABILITIES, TAXES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS,
SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DISBURSEMENTS ARISING FROM THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY
NEGLIGENCE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS RELATED PARTIES); PROVIDED
THAT NO LENDER SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER FOR ANY
PORTION OF SUCH LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS,
JUDGMENTS, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES OR DISBURSEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY.

         Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, Page 60

<PAGE>

appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time
deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking
action under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

         Bank of Nova Scotia, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. and Wells Fargo
Bank Texas, N.A., have been designated as the co-documentation agents in
recognition of the level of their respective Commitments. No such Lender is an
agent for the Lenders and shall not have any obligation hereunder other than
those existing in its capacity as Lender.

         Neither any Issuing Bank nor the Swingline Lender nor any of their
respective Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them hereunder or otherwise in connection with any Loan Document
except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each Issuing Bank and the
Swingline Lender: (i) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of any Loan
Document be a trustee or fiduciary for any Obligated Party, (ii) shall not be
required to initiate any litigation or collection proceedings under any Loan
Document, (iii) shall not be responsible to any Obligated Party for any
recitals, statements, representations, or warranties contained in any Loan
Document, or any certificate or other documentation referred to or provided for
in, or received by any of them under, any Loan Document, or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, enforceability, or sufficiency of any Loan Document or
any other documentation referred to or provided for therein or for any failure
by any Person to perform any of its obligations thereunder, (iv) may consult
with legal counsel (including counsel for Borrower), independent public
accountants, and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants, or experts, and (v) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate, or other instrument or writing believed by it to be
genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by any Loan Document, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline
Lender shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Required
Lenders, and such instructions of the Required Lenders and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders and all
Obligated Parties; provided, however, that neither any Issuing Bank nor the
Swingline Lender shall be required to take any action which exposes it to
personal liability or which is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law.

<PAGE>

                                    (A)      the Borrower, provided that no
consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and

                                    (B)      the Administrative Agent, provided
that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment
to an assignee that is a Lender with a commitment immediately prior to giving
effect to such assignment.

                           (ii)     Assignments shall be subject to the
following additional conditions:

                                    (A)      except in the case of an assignment
to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining

assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such
consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under clauses
(a), (b), (g) or (h) of Article 6 has occurred and is continuing;

                                    (B)      each partial assignment shall be
made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement;

                                    (C)      the parties to each assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

                                    (D)      the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire.

For the purposes of this Section 8.04(b), the term "Approved Fund" means a
Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing,
holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the
ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a
Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an
entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                           (iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section 8.04(b) from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.16 and 8.05). Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does
not comply with this Section 8.04 shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

                           (iv)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy
of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, Page 63

amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                           (v)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed
Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept
such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in
the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement
unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (c)      (i)      Any Lender may, without the consent of
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a
"Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing
to it and its direct or participation interests in Swingline Loans and LC
Disbursements); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in Section 8.08 that affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.16 and 8.05 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.06 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.15 as though it were a Lender.

                           (ii)     A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Sections 2.11 or 2.16 than the applicable
Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant
that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation
sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender.

                  (d)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

CURRENCY CONTRACT, AND (iii) ANY LOSS ARISING FROM ANY CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF
DOLLARS IN RELATION TO ANY LOAN OR LC DISBURSEMENT MADE IN ANOTHER AVAILABLE
CURRENCY WHICH WAS NOT PAID ON THE DATE DUE OR WHICH WAS NOT PAID IN THE
AVAILABLE CURRENCY IN WHICH IT WAS MADE OR IN WHICH THE APPLICABLE LETTER OF
CREDIT WAS ISSUED.

                  (c)      THE BORROWER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, EACH ISSUING BANK, EACH LENDER, EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES
(EACH SUCH PERSON BEING CALLED AN "INDEMNITEE") AGAINST, AND TO HOLD EACH
INDEMNITEE HARMLESS FROM, ANY AND ALL LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND
RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES, INCURRED BY OR
ASSERTED AGAINST ANY INDEMNITEE ARISING OUT OF (I) THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT,
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, (II) THE CONSUMMATION OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, (III) THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS OF
THE LOANS OR THE USE OF ANY LETTER OF CREDIT OR (IV) ANY CLAIM, LITIGATION,
INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER OR NOT ANY
INDEMNITEE IS A PARTY THERETO (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSSES,
CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND RELATED EXPENSES ARISING FROM THE SOLE OR
CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE); PROVIDED THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL
NOT, AS TO ANY INDEMNITEE, BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS,
DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR RELATED EXPENSES (I) ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE RESULTED
FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNITEE OR (II)
RESULT FROM ANY LITIGATION BROUGHT BY SUCH INDEMNITEE AGAINST THE BORROWER OR BY
THE BORROWER AGAINST SUCH INDEMNITEE, IN WHICH THE BORROWER IS THE PREVAILING
PARTY.

                  (d)      The provisions of this Section shall remain operative
and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the termination or satisfaction of all Letter of Credit Liabilities,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any
of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of
this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable on
written demand therefor.

         Section 8.06.     Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any
time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of
the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any Swap Agreement held by such
Lender or Affiliate, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Affiliate
shall have made any demand and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender and Affiliate of a Lender under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which
such Lender or Affiliate may have and are subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

         Section 8.07.     Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

         Section 8.08.     Waivers; Amendment.

                  (a)      No failure or delay of any Obligated Party, the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any power or
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, Page 66

<PAGE>

single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or
consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice or demand on any Obligated Party in any case shall entitle such
party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

                  (b)      Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may
be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided,
however, that no such agreement shall: (i) decrease the principal amount of, or
extend the maturity of any scheduled principal payment date or date for the
payment of any interest on any Loan or the date for any payment of any LC
Disbursement, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof, or
decrease the rate of interest on any Loan, or LC Disbursement without the prior
written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) increase any Commitment
(except pursuant to an Increased Commitment Supplement executed in accordance
with the terms and conditions of Section 2.20 which only needs to be signed by
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders increasing or providing
new Commitments thereunder if the Increased Commitment Supplement does not
increase the Total Commitments to an amount in excess of $250,000,000) or extend
the date when the Commitments terminate or decrease the Facility Fee Percentage
or any Letter of Credit Fee or change the date on which the fees are due and
payable, without the prior written consent of each Lender affected thereby or
(iii) amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.13 or Section 8.04(a)(i), the
provisions of this Section or the definition of the "Required Lenders", without
the prior written consent of each Lender; provided further, however, that no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank hereunder
without the prior written consent of such party. Each Lender shall be bound by
any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this Section and any consent
by any Lender pursuant to this Section shall bind any assignee of its rights and
interests hereunder.

         Section 8.09.     Entire Agreement; Amendment and Restatement. THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO) AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE A "LOAN AGREEMENT" AS DEFINED IN SECTION 26.02(a) OF THE
TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, AND REPRESENT THE ENTIRE CONTRACT AMONG THE
PARTIES RELATIVE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF. ANY PREVIOUS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT) AMONG THE
PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF IS SUPERSEDED BY THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES. This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the
Prior Credit Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents executed in connection herewith does not extinguish the indebtedness
outstanding in connection with the Prior Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents nor does it constitute a novation with respect to such indebtedness.
Each Obligated Party that was a party to any Loan Document prior to the date
hereof represents and warrants that as of the Effective Date there are no claims
or offsets against or defenses or counterclaims to its obligations under the
Prior Credit Agreement or any of the other documents executed in connection
therewith. To induce the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent
to enter into this Agreement, each such Obligated Party (by entering into the
Loan Documents to which it is a party) waives any and all such claims, offsets,
defenses or counterclaims, whether known or unknown, arising prior to the
Effective Date and relating to the Prior Credit Agreement, Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and notwithstanding any Loan Document to the contrary, each

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, Page 67

<PAGE>

Obligated Party (by entering into the Loan Documents to which it is a party) the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders agree and acknowledge
that:

                  (a)      the term "Credit Agreement" as used in each Loan
Document means this Agreement; and

                  (b)      any reference to The Chase Manhattan Bank in any Loan
Document executed prior to the Effective Date means a reference to JPMorgan
Chase Bank (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank as successor in interest by merger
to Chase Bank of Texas, N.A.).

         Section 8.10.     Severability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good - faith negotiations to
replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions
the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.

         Section 8.11.     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts and on telecopy counterparts, each of which shall
constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute but
one contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 8.03.

         Section 8.12.     Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         Section 8.13.     Interest Rate Limitation.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
at any time the applicable interest rate, together with all fees and charges
which are treated as interest under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"),
as provided for herein or in any other document executed in connection herewith,
or otherwise contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender,
shall exceed the Maximum Rate (as defined below) which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable on the Loans of such Lender,
together with all Charges payable to such Lender, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate. As used herein, the term "Maximum Rate" means, at any time and
with respect to any Lender, the maximum rate of non - usurious interest under
applicable law that such Lender may charge Borrower. The Maximum Rate shall be
calculated in a manner that takes into account any and all fees, payments, and
other charges contracted for, charged, or received in connection with the Loan
Documents that constitute interest under applicable law. Each change in any
interest rate provided for herein based upon the Maximum Rate resulting from a
change in the Maximum Rate shall take effect without notice to Borrower at the
time of such change in the Maximum Rate. For purposes of determining the Maximum
Rate under Texas law, the applicable rate ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling
described in, and computed in accordance with Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance
Code.

                  (b)      If the amount of interest, together with all Charges,
payable for the account of any Lender in respect of any interest computation
period is reduced pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section and the amount of
interest, together with all Charges, payable for such Lender's account in
respect of any subsequent interest computation period, computed pursuant to
Section 2.06, would be less than the Maximum Rate, then the amount of interest,
together with all Charges, payable for such Lender's account in respect of such
subsequent interest computation period shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be automatically increased to such Maximum Rate; provided that
at no time shall the aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of
any Lender has been increased pursuant to this paragraph (b) exceed the
aggregate amount

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, Page 68

<PAGE>

by which interest, together with all Charges, paid for its account has
theretofore been reduced pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section.

                  (c)      No provision of this Agreement shall require the
payment or the collection of interest in excess of the maximum amount permitted
by applicable law. If any excess of interest in such respect is hereby provided
for, or shall be adjudicated to be so provided, in this Agreement or otherwise
in connection with this loan transaction, the provisions of this Section shall
govern and prevail and neither the Borrower nor the sureties, guarantors,
successors, or assigns of the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the excess
amount of such interest or any other excess sum paid for the use, forbearance,
or detention of sums loaned pursuant hereto. In the event any Lender ever
receives, collects, or applies as interest any such sum, such amount which would
be in excess of the maximum amount permitted by applicable law shall be applied
as a payment and reduction of the principal of the Loans; and, if the principal
of the Loans has been paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid
to the Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Borrower and each Lender shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any non - principal payment as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
entire contemplated term of the Loans so that interest for the entire term does
not exceed the Maximum Rate.

         Section 8.14.     Confidentiality. For the purposes of this Section
8.14, "Confidential Information" means information delivered to the
Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by
or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that
was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received
by the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender as being confidential
information of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, provided that such term does not
include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to the
Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender prior to the time of such
disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission
by the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender or any Person acting on
their behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to the Administrative Agent, an
Issuing Bank or a Lender other than through disclosure by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to you under
Section 5.18 that are otherwise publicly available. The Administrative Agent,
each Issuing Bank and each Lender agree that they will maintain the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures
adopted by them in good faith to protect confidential information of third
parties delivered to them, provided that the Administrative Agent, an Issuing
Bank or a Lender may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (i) Related
Parties (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the administration
of this Agreement), (ii) its financial advisors and other professional advisors
who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in
accordance with the terms of this Section 8.14, (iii) the Administrative Agent
or other Lender, (iv) any Transferee (if such Person has agreed in writing prior
to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of
this Section 8.14), (v) any Person from which it offers to purchase any Equity
Interest of the Borrower or a Subsidiary (if such Person has agreed in writing
prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 8.14), (vi) any federal or state regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over it, (vii) any nationally recognized rating agency that
requires access to information about its investment portfolio, or (viii) any
other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or
appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order
applicable to it, (x) in response to any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in
connection with any litigation to which it is a party or (z) if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent the Administrative Agent,
an Issuing Bank or a Lender may reasonably determine such delivery and
disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the
protection of the rights and remedies under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in any commitment or fee letter executed in connection herewith to the
contrary, the parties hereto may disclose to any Person, without limitation of
any kind, the "tax treatment" and "tax

AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, Page 69

structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011 - 4) of the Transactions and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Borrower relating to
such tax treatment and tax structure, except that, with respect to any document
or similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax
treatment or tax structure of the Transactions as well as other information,
this proviso shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Transactions.

         Section 8.15.     Non-Application of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance
Code. The provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code are specifically
declared by the parties hereto not to be applicable to this Agreement or to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 8.16.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         Section 8.17.     Judgment Currency. This is a loan transaction in
which the specification of Australian Dollars, Euro or Dollars is of the
essence, and the stipulated currency shall in each instance be the currency of
account and payment in all instances. A payment obligation in one currency
hereunder (the "Original Currency") shall not be discharged by an amount paid in
another currency (the "Other Currency"), whether pursuant to any judgment
expressed in or converted into any Other Currency or in another place except to
the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by a
party hereto of the full amount of the Original Currency payable to such party.
If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert
a sum due hereunder in the Original Currency into the Other Currency, the rate
of exchange that shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with
normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase Original
Currency at the relevant office with the Other Currency on the Business Day next
preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of the
Borrower and the Guarantors in respect of any such sum due from it to the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender under any Loan Document (in
this Section 8.17 called an "Entitled Person") shall, notwithstanding the rate
of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to
the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of
any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the Other Currency such Entitled Person
may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Original Currency
with the amount of the judgment currency so adjudged to be due; and the
Borrower, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees
to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on
demand, in the Original Currency, the amount (if any) by which the sum
originally due to such Entitled Person in the Original Currency hereunder
exceeds the amount of the Other Currency so purchased.

         Section 8.18.     Independence of Covenants. All covenants under the
Loan Documents shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action
or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would
be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default if such action is
taken or such condition exists.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, each of the undersigned parties and any
Subsidiary hereafter added as a "Guarantor" hereto pursuant to a Subsidiary

means all obligations, indebtedness, and liabilities:

                  (a)      of Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the Lenders, or any of them, arising pursuant to the Credit Agreement,

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 1

<PAGE>

                  (b)      of Borrower and the other Subsidiaries of the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders, and the
Affiliates of the Lenders, or any of them, arising pursuant to any Swap
Agreement (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), whether any
of such obligations, indebtedness and liabilities described in clause (a) and
(b) are now existing or hereafter arising, whether direct, indirect, related,
unrelated, fixed, contingent, liquidated, unliquidated, joint, several, or joint
and several, including, without limitation, (i) the obligation of Borrower to
repay the Loans, interest on the Loans, the obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse each Issuing Bank for all LC Disbursements owing to it and all fees,
costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) provided for in the
Credit Agreement and (ii) all post - petition interest and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) whether or not allowed under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or
other similar law. However, the Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited, with
respect to each Guarantor, to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount
that would not render such Guarantor's obligations hereunder subject to
avoidance under Section 544 or 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or under
any applicable state law relating to fraudulent transfers or conveyances. For
the purposes of this Guaranty Agreement, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks, the Lenders and each Affiliate of a Lender who is owed any Guaranteed
Obligations is herein a "Creditor". Furthermore, Borrower and any other party
directly obligated on any Guaranteed Obligation is herein an "Obligated Party".
This Guaranty Agreement is an absolute, present and continuing Guaranty
Agreement of payment and not of collectibility and is in no way conditional or
contingent upon any attempt to collect from any Obligated Party, any collateral
securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guarantor of the obligations
guarantied hereby or upon any other action, occurrence or circumstance
whatsoever. In the event that an Obligated Party shall fail so to pay any of
such Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay
the same when due to the Administrative Agent or, with respect to Guaranteed
Obligations arising in connection with a Swap Agreement, to the applicable
Creditor, without demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind. Each
default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any
obligation guarantied hereby shall give rise to a separate cause of action
hereunder and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action
arises.

         2.       INDEMNIFICATION. EACH GUARANTOR AGREES TO INDEMNIFY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, EACH ISSUING BANK, EACH LENDER, AND EACH OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES (EACH SUCH PERSON BEING CALLED AN "INDEMNITEE")
AGAINST, AND TO HOLD EACH INDEMNITEE HARMLESS FROM, ANY AND ALL LOSSES, CLAIMS,
DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING REASONABLE COUNSEL FEES AND
EXPENSES, INCURRED BY OR ASSERTED AGAINST ANY INDEMNITEE ARISING OUT OF (i) THE
PRIOR GUARANTY OR THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT, (ii) THE CONSUMMATION OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
DOCUMENT, (iii) THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE LOANS OR THE USE OF ANY LETTER OF
CREDIT OR (iv) ANY CLAIM, LITIGATION, INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO
ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER OR NOT ANY INDEMNITEE IS A PARTY THERETO
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND
RELATED EXPENSES ARISING FROM THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF THE
INDEMNITEE); PROVIDED THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL NOT, AS TO ANY INDEMNITEE, BE
AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR
RELATED EXPENSES (i) ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNITEE OR (ii) RESULT FROM ANY LITIGATION
BROUGHT BY SUCH INDEMNITEE AGAINST ANY OBLIGATED PARTY OR BY ANY OBLIGATED PARTY
AGAINST SUCH INDEMNITEE, IN WHICH THE BORROWER OR SUCH GUARANTOR IS THE
PREVAILING PARTY.

         3.       OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligations of each Guarantor
hereunder shall be primary, continuing, absolute, joint, several, irrevocable
and unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 2

<PAGE>

enforceability of any Transaction Document, shall not be subject to any
counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense based upon any claim any Guarantor
may have against any Obligated Party, any Creditor or otherwise or any claim any
Obligated Party may have against any Creditor or otherwise, and shall remain in
full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged
or in any way affected by, any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or
not such Guarantor shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including,
without limitation: (a) any amendment, modification of or supplement to any
Transaction Document or any other instrument referred to therein (except that
the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder shall apply to the applicable
Transaction Document or such other instruments as so amended, modified or
supplemented) or any assignment or transfer of any thereof or of any interest
therein, or any furnishing, acceptance or release of any security for the
obligations due under any Transaction Document, (b) any waiver, consent,
extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in respect of any
Transaction Document; (c) any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment, composition,
liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to the Borrower or its property;
(d) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor or of any
Obligated Party into or with any other corporation or any sale, lease or
transfer of any or all of the assets of any Guarantor or of any Obligated Party
to any Person; (e) an failure on the part of any Obligated Party for any reason
to comply with or perform any of the terms of any other agreement with any
Guarantor; or (f) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (other than a release of
the obligations of a Guarantor hereunder granted in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph 21 hereof). Each Guarantor covenants that its
obligations hereunder will not be discharged except by payment in full of all of
the Guaranteed Obligations or a release granted in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph 21.

         4.       WAIVER. Each Guarantor unconditionally waives to the fullest
extent permitted by law, (a) notice of acceptance hereof, of any action taken or
omitted in reliance hereon and of any defaults by any Obligated Party in the
payment of any amounts due under any Transaction Document, and of any of the
matters referred to in paragraph 2 or 3 hereof, (b) all notices which may be
required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any of the rights of
any Creditor from time to time against any Guarantor, including, without
limitation, presentment to or demand for payment from any Obligated Party or any
Guarantor, notice to any Obligated Party or to any Guarantor of default or
protest for nonpayment or dishonor and the filing of claims with a court in the
event of the bankruptcy of the Borrower, (c) any right to the enforcement,
assertion or exercise by any Creditor of any right, power or remedy conferred in
this Guaranty Agreement or any Transaction Document, (d) any requirement or
diligence on the part of any Creditor and (e) any other act or omission or thing
or delay to do any other act or thing which might in any manner or to any extent
vary the risk of any Guarantor or which might otherwise operate as a discharge
of any Guarantor. The exercise by any Creditor of any right or remedy hereunder
or under any other instrument, or at law or in equity, shall not preclude the
concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy.

         5.       OBLIGATIONS UNIMPAIRED. Each Guarantor authorizes the
Creditors without notice or demand to any Guarantor and without affecting the
obligations of any Guarantor hereunder, from time to time (a) to renew,
compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or
otherwise change the terms of, all or any part of any Transaction Document or
any other instrument referred to therein, (b) to take and hold security for the
payment and performance of the obligations under any Transaction Document, for
the performance of this Guaranty Agreement or otherwise for the indebtedness
guaranteed hereby and to exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security,
(c) to apply any such security and to direct the order or manner of sale thereof
as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may determine; (d) to obtain
additional or substitute endorsers or guarantors; (e) to exercise or refrain
from exercising any rights against any Obligated Party and others; and (f) to
apply any sums, by whomsoever paid or however realized, to the payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the obligations under the
Transaction Documents and any other Guaranteed Obligation. Each Guarantor waives
any right to require any Creditor to proceed against any additional or
substitute endorsers or guarantors or to pursue or exhaust any security provided
by any Obligated Party, any Guarantor or any other Person or to pursue any other
remedy available to such entities.

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 3

<PAGE>

         6.       COVENANTS. Each Guarantor agrees that, so long as any Creditor
has any commitment or any other obligations under any Transaction Document, or
any amount payable hereunder remains unpaid it shall comply with all covenants
set forth in the Credit Agreement and any other Transaction Document applicable
to it.

         7.       SUBROGATION. Each Guarantor agrees that it will not exercise
any rights which it may have acquired by way of subrogation under this Guaranty
Agreement, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, or accept any payment on
account of such subrogation rights, or any rights of reimbursement or indemnity
or any rights or recourse to any security for the obligations under the Credit
Agreement or this Guaranty Agreement unless and until all of the obligations,
undertakings or conditions to be performed or observed by the Obligated Parties
pursuant to the Transaction Documents at the time of any Guarantor's exercise of
any such right shall have been performed, observed or paid in full. For a period
of one year after the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, each
Guarantor hereby waives (x) all rights of subrogation which it may at any time
otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty Agreement (whether, statutory or
otherwise) to the claims of the Creditors against any Obligated Party or any
other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations (the Obligated Parties and such
other guarantors are each herein referred to as an "Other Party") and all
contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or
indemnity from any Other Party which it may at any time otherwise have as a
result of this Guaranty Agreement; and (y) any right to enforce any other remedy
which any Creditor now has or may hereafter have against any Other Party, any
endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

         8.       CONTRIBUTION. The Guarantors collectively desire to allocate
among themselves in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under
the Loan Documents. Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is
made by a Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement or any other Transaction
Document (a "Funding Guarantor") that exceeds its Fair Share (as defined below),
that Funding Guarantor shall, subject to paragraph 7 hereof, be entitled to a
contribution from each of the other Guarantors in the amount of such other
Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall (as defined below), with the result that all
such contributions will cause each Guarantor's Aggregate Payments (as defined
below) to equal its Fair Share. "Fair Share" means, with respect to a Guarantor
as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the
Adjusted Maximum Amount (as defined below) with respect to such Guarantor to (y)
the aggregate of the Adjusted Maximum Amounts with respect to all Guarantors,
multiplied by (ii) the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such
date by all Funding Guarantors under this Guaranty Agreement or under the other
Loan Documents in respect of the obligations guarantied. "Fair Share Shortfall"
means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of determination, the excess,
if any, of the Fair Share of such Guarantor over the Aggregate Payments of such
Guarantor. "Adjusted Maximum Amount" means, with respect to a Guarantor as of
any date of determination, the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations of
such Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
determined in accordance with the provisions hereof (including, without
limitation, the limitations on such obligations contained in paragraph 1
hereof); provided that, solely for purposes of calculating the Adjusted Maximum
Amount with respect to any Guarantor for purposes of this paragraph 8 the assets
or liabilities arising by virtue of any rights to or obligations of contribution
hereunder shall not be considered as assets or liabilities of such Guarantor.
"Aggregate Payments" means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of
determination, the aggregate amount of all payments and distributions made on or
before such date by such Contributing Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party (including,
without limitation, in respect of this paragraph 8). The amounts payable as
contributions hereunder shall be determined as of the date on which the related
payment or distribution is made by the applicable Funding Guarantor. The
allocation among Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this paragraph
8 shall not be construed in any way to limit the liability of any Guarantor
hereunder or under any other Transaction Document.

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 4

<PAGE>

         9.       REINSTATEMENT OF GUARANTY AGREEMENT. This Guaranty Agreement
shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if and to
the extent at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the sums due to
any Creditor for principal, premium, if any, or interest on the obligations
under any Transaction Document or any of the other Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by such entity upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any
Obligated Party or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect
to any Obligated Party, any Guarantor or any substantial part of their
respective properties, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been
made. If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal
due under any Transaction Document shall at any time have occurred and be
continuing and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented or the right of
any Creditor to receive any payment under the applicable Transaction Document
shall at such time be delayed or otherwise affected by reason of the pendency
against any Obligated Party of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or
insolvency law, each Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Guaranty
Agreement and its obligations hereunder, the maturity of such principal amount
shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if the
applicable Creditor had accelerated the same in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Transaction Documents, and any Guarantor shall forthwith pay such
accelerated principal amount, accrued interest and premium, if any, thereon and
any other amounts guaranteed hereunder.

         10.      PAYMENTS. Each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally,
guarantees that the Obligated Parties shall pay the Guaranteed Obligations to
the Administrative Agent, with respect to Guaranteed Obligations arising under
the Loan Documents and with respect to the other Transaction Documents, the
applicable Creditor thereunder, in currency required by the applicable
Transaction Document and in immediately available funds, at the times and places
provided in, and otherwise strictly in accordance with the terms and provisions
of, the applicable Transaction Document (regardless of any law, regulation or
decree now or hereafter in effect which might in any manner affect the
Guaranteed Obligations, or the rights of any such entity with respect thereto as
against any Obligated Party, or cause or permit to be invoked any alteration in
the time, amount or manner of payment by any Obligated Party of any or all of
the Guaranteed Obligations), without set - off or counterclaim and free and
clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any present or future
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions, withholdings now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld
or assessed by any country (or by any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein) excluding income and franchise taxes of the United States of
America or any political subdivision, state or taxing authority thereof or
therein (including Puerto Rico) such non - excluded taxes being called "Foreign
Taxes"). If any Foreign Taxes are required to be withheld from any amount
payable to any Creditor under this Guaranty Agreement, under the Credit
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the amounts so payable to such
holder shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such entity (after
payment of all Foreign Taxes) interest or any such other amounts at the rates or
in the amounts specified in the applicable Transaction Document. In the event
any payment is made by a Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement, then such
Guarantor shall, subject to paragraph 7 hereof, be subrogated to the rights then
held by a Creditor with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent to
which the Guaranteed Obligations was discharged by such Guarantor. All payments
received by the Administrative Agent under this Guaranty Agreement shall be
allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the Lenders' Applicable
Percentages unless the Credit Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement directs
that the proceeds shall be distributed in another manner. All payments directly
made to any other Creditor under this Guaranty Agreement shall be applied in
accordance with the applicable Transaction Document subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

         11.      RANK OF GUARANTY AGREEMENT. Each Guarantor agrees that its
obligations under this Guaranty Agreement shall rank at least pari passu with
all other unsecured senior obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter
existing.

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 5

<PAGE>

         12.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE GUARANTORS.

                  Each Guarantor represents and warrants to each Creditor as
follows:

                  (a)      Existence. It: (i) is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization; (ii) has all requisite power and authority to own its property and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted; (iii) is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required, except where the failure so to qualify would not
result in a Material Adverse Effect; and (iv) has the corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Guaranty
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party.

                  (b)      Authorization. Its execution, delivery and
performance of this Guaranty Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, and the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party: (i) have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action and (ii) will not (A) violate (1)
any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation to which it is subject or
of its certificate of incorporation or other constituent documents or by - laws,
(2) any order of any Governmental Authority or (3) any provision of any Material
indenture, agreement or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it
or any of its property is or may be bound, (iii) be in conflict with, result in
a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or both) a
default under any such indenture, agreement or other instrument or (iv) result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of its property or assets.

                  (c)      Enforceability. This Guaranty Agreement constitutes,
and when entered into, the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party
will constitute, its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it
in accordance with their respective terms, as such enforceability may be limited
by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii)
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  (d)      No Consents. No action, consent or approval of,
registration or filing with or other action by any Governmental Authority is or
will be required in connection with its execution, delivery or performance of
this Guaranty Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party.

                  (e)      Credit Agreement Representations. All representations
and warranties in the Credit Agreement relating to it are true and correct as of
the date hereof and are restated herein with the same force and effect as if
such representations and warranties had been made on and as of such date except
to the extent that such representations and warranties relate specifically to
another date.

                  (f)      Information. It has adequate means to obtain from the
Obligated Parties on a continuing basis information concerning the financial
condition and assets of the Obligated Parties and it is not relying upon any
Creditor to provide (and no Creditor shall have any duty to provide) any such
information to it either now or in the future.

                  (g)      Benefit. The Borrower provides the Guarantors
financing from time to time and some of the funds used by the Borrower to
provide such financing have been and will hereafter be borrowed by the Borrower
under the Credit Agreement. As a result, the value of the consideration received
and to be received by each Guarantor as a result of the Borrower and the Lenders
entering into the Credit Agreement and each Guarantor's executing and delivering
this Guaranty Agreement (in light of, among other things, the contribution
provisions of paragraph 8 hereof) is reasonably worth at least as much as the
liability and

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 6

<PAGE>

obligation of each Guarantor hereunder, and such liability and obligation and
the Transaction Documents have benefited and may reasonably be expected to
benefit each Guarantor directly or indirectly.

                  (h)      Solvency. Each Guarantor both individually and on a
consolidated basis: (i) owns and will own assets (included in such assets the
rights of contribution set forth in paragraph 8 hereof) the fair saleable value
of which are (A) greater than the total amount of its liabilities (including
contingent liabilities) and (B) greater than the amount that will be required to
pay probable liabilities of then existing debts as they become absolute and
matured considering all financing alternatives and potential asset sales
reasonably available to it; (ii) has capital that is not unreasonably small in
relation to its business as presently conducted; and (iii) does not intend to
incur and does not believe that it will incur debts beyond its ability to pay
such debts as they become due.

         13.      SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Creditor is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Creditor to or for the
credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the obligations of
such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty Agreement,
irrespective of whether or not such Creditor shall have made any demand under
this Guaranty Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Creditor under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Creditor may have and are
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

         14.      SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS. In addition and not in limitation
of paragraph 6 hereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows:

                  (a)      Each Guarantor hereby agrees that the Subordinated
Indebtedness (as defined below) shall be subordinate and junior in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations as herein
provided. The Subordinated Indebtedness shall not be payable, and no payment of
principal, interest or other amounts on account thereof, and no property or
guarantee of any nature to secure or pay the Subordinated Indebtedness shall be
made or given, directly or indirectly by or on behalf of any Other Party (as
defined in paragraph 7 above) or received, accepted, retained or applied by any
Guarantor unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in
full in cash for one year; except that prior to receipt of a notice from the
Administrative Agent under this paragraph (which may be given at any time an
Event of Default exists), a Guarantor shall have the right to receive payments
on the Subordinated Indebtedness made in the ordinary course of business. After
receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent delivered under the
preceding sentence, no payments of principal or interest or any other amounts
may be made or given, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of any Other Party
or received, accepted, retained or applied by any Guarantor unless and until the
Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full in cash for one year. If any
sums shall be paid to a Guarantor by any Other Party or any other Person on
account of the Subordinated Indebtedness when such payment is not permitted
hereunder, such sums shall be held in trust by such Guarantor for the benefit of
the Creditors and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent without
affecting the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement and may
be applied by the Administrative Agent against the Guaranteed Obligations. Upon
the request of the Administrative Agent, a Guarantor shall execute, deliver, and
endorse to the Administrative Agent such documentation as the Administrative
Agent may request to perfect, preserve, and enforce its rights hereunder. For
purposes of this Guaranty Agreement and with respect to a Guarantor, the term
"Subordinated Indebtedness" means, with respect to any Guarantor, all
indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations of any Other Party to such Guarantor,
whether such indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations now exist or are
hereafter incurred or arise, or are direct, indirect, contingent, primary,
secondary, several, joint and several, or otherwise, and irrespective of whether
such indebtedness, liabilities, or obligations are evidenced by a note,
contract, open account, or otherwise, and irrespective of the Person or Persons
in

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 7

<PAGE>

whose favor such indebtedness, obligations, or liabilities may, at their
inception, have been, or may hereafter be created, or the manner in which they
have been or may hereafter be acquired by such Guarantor.

                  (b)      Each Guarantor agrees that any and all Liens
(including any judgment liens) upon any Other Party's assets securing payment of
any Subordinated Indebtedness shall be and remain inferior and subordinate to
any and all Liens upon any Other Party's assets securing payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, regardless of whether such Liens in
favor of a Guarantor or any Creditor presently exist or are hereafter created or
attached. Without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and
otherwise subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraph 7 hereof, when an
Event of Default exists, no Guarantor shall (i) file suit against any Other
Party or exercise or enforce any other creditor's right it may have against any
Other Party, or (ii) foreclose, repossess, sequester, or otherwise take steps or
institute any action or proceedings (judicial or otherwise, including without
limitation the commencement of, or joinder in, any liquidation, bankruptcy,
rearrangement, debtor's relief or insolvency proceeding) to enforce any
obligations of any Other Party to such Guarantor or any Liens held by such
Guarantor on assets of any Other Party.

                  (c)      In the event of any receivership, bankruptcy,
reorganization, rearrangement, debtor's relief, or other insolvency proceeding
involving any Other Party as debtor, the Administrative Agent shall have the
right to prove and vote any claim under the Subordinated Indebtedness and to
receive directly from the receiver, trustee or other court custodian all
dividends, distributions, and payments made in respect of the Subordinated
Indebtedness until the Guaranteed Obligations has been paid in full in cash. The
Administrative Agent may apply any such dividends, distributions, and payments
against the Guaranteed Obligations.

         15.      NOTICES. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all
notices, consents, directions, approvals, instructions, requests and other
communications required or permitted by the terms hereof shall be in writing,
and any such communication shall become effective when received, addressed in
the following manner: (a) if to any Guarantor, in care of the Borrower in
accordance with the notice provisions in the Credit Agreement or (b) if to any
Lender or any Issuing Bank, or any Affiliate thereof, to the respective address
of the applicable Lender set forth in the notice provisions of the Credit
Agreement, with a copy to the Administrative Agent; or (c) if to the
Administrative Agent, to the respective address set forth in the notice
provisions of the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that any such addressee
may change its address for communications by notice given as aforesaid to the
other parties hereto.

         16.      CONSTRUCTION. The section and subsection headings in this
Guaranty Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall neither be
deemed to be a part of this Guaranty Agreement nor modify, define, expand or
limit any of the terms or provisions hereof. All references herein to numbered
sections or paragraphs, unless otherwise indicated, are to sections and
paragraphs of this Guaranty Agreement. Words and definitions in the singular
shall be read and construed as though in the plural and vice versa, and words in
the masculine, neuter or feminine gender shall be read and construed as though
in either of the other genders where the context so requires.

         17.      SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Guaranty Agreement, or
the application thereof to any Person or circumstances, shall, for any reason or
to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability
shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remainder
of this Guaranty Agreement, and the application of that provision to other
persons or circumstances shall not be affected but, rather, shall be enforced to
the extent permitted by applicable law.

         18.      STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. To the extent permitted by law, any
acknowledgment or new promise, whether by payment of principal or interest or
otherwise and whether by any Obligated Party or others (including any
Guarantor), with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall, if the
statute of limitations in favor of any Guarantor against any Creditor shall have
commenced to run, toll the running of such statute of

AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY AGREEMENT, Page 8

<PAGE>

limitations and, if the period of such statute of limitations shall have
expired, prevent the operation of such statute of limitations.

         19.      FEES. The Guarantors shall, jointly and severally, pay on
demand all reasonable attorneys' fees and all other reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Creditors in connection with the administration,
enforcement, or collection of this Guaranty Agreement.

         20.      SUCCESSORS. The terms and provisions of this Guaranty
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Guarantor and
the Creditors from time to time and their respective permitted successors,
transferees and assigns.

         21.      ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT; RELEASE. This Guaranty Agreement\
amends and restates in its entirety the Prior Guaranty. From and after the date
hereof, the guaranty of all indebtedness guaranteed by the Prior Guaranty is
continued, and not extinguished, discharged or satisfied. All references in the
Loan Documents to the Prior Guaranty shall be deemed to mean this Guaranty
Agreement, as an amendment and restatement of the Prior Guaranty. THIS GUARANTY
AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES A "LOAN AGREEMENT" AS DEFINED IN SECTION 26.02(a) OF THE
TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, AND REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE CONTRACT AMONG THE
PARTIES RELATIVE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF. ANY PREVIOUS
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF IS
SUPERSEDED BY THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES. NOTHING IN THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
IS INTENDED TO CONFER UPON ANY PARTY OTHER THAN THE PARTIES HERETO ANY RIGHTS,
REMEDIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES UNDER OR BY REASON OF THIS GUARANTY
AGREEMENT. THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT IS INTENDED BY EACH GUARANTOR AND EACH
CREDITOR AS A FINAL AND COMPLETE EXPRESSION OF THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTY
AGREEMENT, AND NO COURSE OF DEALING AMONG ANY GUARANTOR AND ANY CREDITOR, NO
COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, NO TRADE PRACTICES, AND NO EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS OR OTHER EXTRINSIC
EVIDENCE OF ANY NATURE SHALL BE USED TO CONTRADICT, VARY, SUPPLEMENT OR MODIFY
ANY TERM OF THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT. No amendment of or supplement to this
Guaranty Agreement, or waiver or modification of, or consent under, the terms
hereof shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Guarantors, the
Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders; except that without the agreement
of the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Material
Subsidiary may be added hereto as a "Guarantor" by its execution and delivery of
a Subsidiary Joinder Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Guarantor
shall be released from its obligations under this Guaranty Agreement without the
prior written consent of all the Lenders, except that the Administrative Agent
may, without the consent or agreement of any Lender, release a Guarantor if such
Guarantor or its assets have been sold to a third party not affiliated with the
Borrower or any other Guarantor in a transaction permitted by Section 5.11 of
the Credit Agreement. This Guaranty Agreement may be amended or otherwise
modified, and any Guarantor may be released from any and all obligations
hereunder without the consent or agreement of any Affiliate of any Lender.

         Section 2.01.     Sharing Notice. Upon an Acceleration with respect to
any Credit Facility, the accelerating Lender shall immediately notify the
Collateral Agent thereof and of its estimation of the Default Reference Date

shall demonstrate such calculations in reasonable detail. If the Collateral
Agent thereafter receives information which demonstrates that the Collateral
Agent's prior calculations were erroneous, the Collateral Agent shall
recalculate each Lender's Funded Obligations and each Lender's Sharing
Percentage, and shall promptly notify all Lenders of such recalculations.

                  Section 3.01(b) to be given) and an Acceleration occurs for
                  any reason thereafter without the related Event of Default
                  having been cured or waived, the later of:

                                    (i)      the date of the Event of Default

                  Default; or

                                    (ii)     the date 180 days prior to the
                  Acceleration; or

                           (b)      the date on which Acceleration occurs.

                  "ACCELERATION" means the earlier of (a) the acceleration of
         the maturity of any amount outstanding under a Credit Facility or, with
         respect to Obligated Party Swap Agreements, the early termination or
         settlement of any transaction thereunder as the result of a
         "Termination Event" or similar event and (b) a Bankruptcy Event, with
         the term "BANKRUPTCY EVENT" meaning any of the following events: (a)
         any Obligated Party (i) is generally not paying, or admits in writing
         its inability to pay, its debts as they become due, (ii) files, or
         consents by answer or otherwise to the filing against it of, a petition
         for relief or reorganization or arrangement or any other petition in
         bankruptcy, for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy,

         or approving a petition for relief or reorganization or any other
         petition in bankruptcy or for liquidation or to take advantage of any
         bankruptcy or insolvency law of any jurisdiction, or ordering the
         dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of an Obligated Party, or any
         such petition shall be filed against an Obligated Party and such
         petition shall not be dismissed within 60 days.

         Section 2.02.     Receipt of Reallocable Payments; Purchase of
Participations. If any Lender obtains or obtained any Reallocable Payment after
the Default Reference Date or if, after the Default Reference Date and the
adjustment to the Sharing Percentages under Section 2.04 hereof, such Lender
received more than its Sharing Percentage of a Reallocable Payment, such Lender
shall promptly after the receipt of a Reallocable Payment (or, if later, after
receipt of the Sharing Notice) purchase at par from the other Lenders such
participations in the Funded Obligations held by such other Lenders as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share such Reallocable Payment (net
of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid by such Lender in so obtaining the
same) ratably based on the Sharing Percentages then in effect. Such
participations shall be evidenced by this Agreement. Although they shall have no
obligation to do so, the Required Lenders may agree upon another arrangement for
vesting in the sharing Lender the appropriate portion of the rights and benefits
under the Credit Facilities of the Lenders with whom such Reallocable Payment is
shared. As used in this Section 2.02 and elsewhere in this Agreement, the term
"REALLOCABLE

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 8

<PAGE>

PAYMENT" means any amount received by a Lender in respect of any Credit Facility
by virtue of any voluntary or involuntary payment or prepayment made by or for
the account of any Obligated Party, by virtue of the application of any
provision of any of the Financing Documents (other than this Agreement), or by
virtue of an exercise of any Set - Off Rights or similar mechanism or in any
other manner (except pursuant to this Agreement); provided, however, that in no
event shall any of the following be deemed to be Reallocable Payments:

                           (i)      Proceeds (which shall be shared by the
Lenders in accordance with Section 2.06);

                           (ii)     The proceeds of any property other than the
Collateral in which a Lender shall have been granted a Lien in accordance with
the permissions of the Credit Facilities;

                           (iii)    Any amount received (through the exercise of
Set - Off Rights or otherwise) by a Lender and applied to any obligation owed to
such Lender by an Obligated Party which arise directly from the deposit,
collection and other cash management or deposit services provided by such Lender
to such Obligated Party;

                           (iv)     Payments accompanied by clear instructions
from the applicable Obligated Party or other Person making the payment that such
payments are to be applied to other obligations;

                           (v)      Payments distributed by a court of competent
jurisdiction or in a proceeding commenced under any bankruptcy or similar
proceeding specifically for application to or on account of other obligations;

                           (vi)     With respect to any revolving credit
facility, any repayments of advances made on a revolving basis after the Default
Reference Date which are not in excess of the aggregate advances made after the
Default Reference Date (provided that the amount of the repayments which are in
excess of the aggregate advances made after the Default Reference Date shall be
"Reallocable Payments" and shall be shared in accordance with this Section
2.02); and

                           (vii)    regularly scheduled payment of principal or
interest required under any Credit Facility (but excluding any such payment that
is contingent upon the presence or happening of a specified event or occurrence
such as the sale of assets, a change of control of the Company, a cash sweep or
otherwise) received prior to the Default Reference Date.

Except as provided in the foregoing exceptions, any payments made by any
Obligated Party at any time after the Default Reference Date to any Lender on
any loans or other extensions of credit made to any Obligated Party other than
under the Credit Facilities shall be deemed by the Lender receiving such
payments to be payments under its respective Credit Facility and therefore
Reallocable Payments. As among any Lender group, the provisions of this Section
2.02 shall supersede and control in the event of any conflict between this
Section and any similar section contained in any Credit Facility.

         Section 2.03.     Preferences, etc. If any Lender purchases a
participation pursuant to Section 2.02 and:

                  (a)      the amount obtained by such Lender which gave rise to
such participation or any part thereof is required to be repaid, and is repaid,
by such Lender to any Obligated Party or any other Person; or

                  (b)      such purchase was made based upon an erroneous prior
calculation of the Sharing Percentages as calculated in accordance with Section
2.01; or

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 9

<PAGE>

                  (c)      the Sharing Percentages on which such purchase was
based changed in accordance with Section 2.04 and the purchasing Lender retains
less than its Sharing Percentage of the applicable Reallocable Payment;

then the purchase of the participations under Section 2.02 shall be rescinded to
the extent necessary to provide funds for such recovery, correct the error or
take into account the changed Sharing Percentages and each selling Lender shall
promptly (after its receipt of notification from the purchasing Lender) repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price for such participation to such extent,
together with an amount equal to such selling Lender's ratable share (according
to the proportion of (x) the amount of such selling Lender's required repayment
to the purchasing Lender to (y) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered or required to be
returned.

         Section 2.04.     Adjustments to Sharing Percentages. If, at any time
after the date of a Sharing Notice:

                  (a)      a Lender is required to repay to any Obligated Party
or any other Person all or any portion of an amount received on or prior to the
date of such Sharing Notice with the result that such Lender's Funded
Obligations are increased, or

                  (b)      an amount originally included in the Funded
Obligations of a Lender under its Credit Facility as a contingent obligation
(such as a letter of credit) ceases to be an obligation because of its expiry,
reduction, cancellation or otherwise, with the result that such Funded
Obligation is reduced,

then the Sharing Percentages of the Lenders shall be adjusted on the first
Business Day of the next calendar month to reflect such increase or reduction,
and each Lender shall promptly (and in any event within five Business Days after
its receipt of notification from the Collateral Agent) purchase or rescind its
participation interest in the Funding Obligations in accordance with either
Section 2.02 or 2.03 hereof, as applicable.

         Section 2.05.     Collateral Proceeds.

                  (a)      Pro Rata Treatment. The Collateral Agent shall be the
secured party under the Security Documents and shall hold the Collateral, all
for the benefit of the Creditors. The Lenders hereby agree that they will
receive pro rata treatment in connection with all payments, distributions,
collections or recoveries relating to the Collateral. Each payment or
distribution by or from or received in connection with the exercise of remedies
after a Default or an Event of Default in respect of the Collateral shall be
shared and applied to the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.06.

                  (b)      This Agreement Controlling. The provisions contained
herein concerning the Collateral and Proceeds shall be controlling,
notwithstanding the terms of any agreement between any Creditor and any
Obligated Party under any other document or instrument between such parties,
whether or not bankruptcy, receivership or insolvency proceedings shall at any
time have been commenced.

         Section 2.06.     Application of Proceeds. The Proceeds of any sale,
enforcement or other disposition of any of the Collateral or other distribution
in respect of the Collateral, in each case following a Default or an Event of
Default, shall be applied by the Collateral Agent in the following order:

                  first, to the payment of all costs, fees and expenses incurred
by the Collateral Agent in connection with the realization upon the Collateral
under the Security Documents or this Agreement, including, without limitation,
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection
with the defense of any claim, suit, action or proceeding against the Collateral
Agent, as provided below in Section 5.08;

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 10

<PAGE>

                  second, to the payment of the Funded Obligations of the
Lenders, which payment shall be shared by the Lenders according to their
respective Sharing Percentages until all the liquidated Funded Obligations have
been satisfied in full and all contingent reimbursement obligations in respect
of letters of credit issued under any Credit Facility and all contingent Swap
Obligations have been fully cash collateralized;

                  third, to the payment of the other Obligations owed to
Creditors and then due, which payment shall be shared by the Creditors pro rata
determined based on the outstanding amounts thereof;

                  fourth, to the payment to the Company or its successors or
assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, or otherwise as
required by law, if any surplus is then remaining from such proceeds.

Portions of the proceeds of the Collateral distributed to a Lender may
thereafter be held as collateral for the contingent reimbursement obligations in
respect of letters of credit issued under the Credit Facilities. In the event
that any such letter of credit expires undrawn and as a result the contingent
reimbursement obligations relating thereto terminate, the Creditor holding such
Collateral agrees to return such proceeds to the Collateral Agent for
distribution in accordance with this Section 2.06 to be distributed as Proceeds
of Collateral hereunder.

         Section 2.07.     Proceeds Received Directly by a Lender. If any
Creditor receives any Proceeds, other than from the Collateral Agent, such
Person shall: (a) notify the Collateral Agent in writing of the nature of such
receipt, the date of the receipt and the amount thereof, (b) deduct from the
Proceeds received any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with the acquisition of such Proceeds, (c) hold the
remaining amount of such Proceeds in trust for the benefit of the Collateral
Agent until paid over to the Collateral Agent and (d) pay the remaining amount
of such Proceeds to the Collateral Agent promptly upon receipt thereof. Upon
receipt, the Collateral Agent shall promptly distribute the Proceeds so received
in accordance with Section 2.06.

         Section 2.08.     Incorrect Distribution If any Creditor receives any
Proceeds in an amount in excess of the amount such Person is entitled to receive
under the terms hereof, such Person shall (a) hold such excess Proceeds in trust
for the benefit of the Collateral Agent until paid over to the Collateral Agent
and (b) shall promptly pay the excess amount of such Proceeds to the Collateral
Agent. The Collateral Agent shall promptly distribute the amount so received to
in accordance with the terms of Section 2.06.

         Section 2.09.     Return of Proceeds. If at any time payment, in whole
or in part, of any Proceeds distributed hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored or returned by the Collateral Agent or by any Creditor as a
preference, fraudulent conveyance or otherwise under any bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar law, then each Person receiving any portion of such Proceeds agrees,
upon demand, to return the portion of such Proceeds it has received to the
Person responsible for restoring or returning such Proceeds.

         Section 2.10.     Notice to Persons making Distributions. Each Creditor
shall promptly and appropriately instruct any Person (other than Collateral
Agent) making any distribution of Proceeds or Reallocable Payments to make such
distribution so as to give effect to this Agreement.

         Section 2.11.     Perfection by Possession. Collateral Agent hereby
appoints each Lender and the Multiyear Agent to serve as its bailee to perfect
the Collateral Agent's liens and security interest in any Collateral, including
any Proceeds, in the possession of any such Person (and continues the
appointments made under the Original Intercreditor Agreement). Any such party
possessing such Collateral agrees to so act as bailee for the Collateral Agent
in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof.

         Section 2.12.     Non-Cash Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, if the Collateral Agent, acting upon the instructions of
the Required Lenders, shall ever acquire any Collateral

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 11

<PAGE>

through foreclosure or by a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or by retaining
any of the Collateral in satisfaction of all or part of the Obligations or if
any Proceeds or other property received by the Collateral Agent or any Creditor
to be distributed and shared pursuant to this Article 2 are in a form other than
immediately available funds, the Person receiving such Collateral, Proceeds or
other property shall not be required to remit any share thereof under the terms
hereof and the Creditors shall only be entitled to their undivided interests
therein as determined hereby. The Creditors shall receive the applicable
portions of any immediately available funds consisting of Proceeds from such
Collateral or proceeds of such non-cash Proceeds or other property so acquired
only if and when paid in connection with the subsequent disposition thereof.
While any Collateral or other property to be shared pursuant to this Article 2
is held by the Collateral Agent or a Creditor pursuant to this Section 2.12,
such Person shall hold such Collateral or other property for the benefit of the
Creditors in accordance with their respective undivided interest therein and all
matters relating to the management, operation, further disposition or any other
aspect of such Collateral or other property shall be resolved by the agreement
of the Required Lenders.

                                   ARTICLE 3.

                          Cooperation Among Creditors

other Creditors that:

any calculation as referred to in Section 2.01 or Section 2.04 of this Agreement
or otherwise required for any other purpose hereof;

                  (b)      it will, not later than 60 days after it has become
aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default which it believes will not be
cured or waived, give the Collateral Agent notice, and if such notice is oral,
confirmed in writing, of such Event of Default and stating that the same
constitutes a Notice of Event of Default (a "NOTICE OF EVENT OF DEFAULT"); and

                  (c)      it will give the Collateral Agent and the other
Lenders immediate written notice of any acceleration of any of its Funded
Obligations or suspension of all or any portion of its commitments to extend
credit under any of the Credit Facilities.

         Section 3.02.     Parties Having Other Relationships. Each Creditor
acknowledges and accepts that now and in the future the other Creditors or their
respective Affiliates may lend to the Company or any Subsidiary on a basis other
than as covered by this Agreement or may accept deposits from, act as trustee
under indentures of, act as servicing bank or any similar function under any
credit relationship with, and generally engage in any kind of business with
Company or any Subsidiary, all as if such Person were not a party to this
Agreement. Except as set forth herein, each Creditor acknowledges that the other
Creditors and their respective Affiliates may exercise all contractual and legal
rights and remedies which may exist from time to time with respect to such other
existing and future relationships without any duty to account therefor to the
other Creditors except as necessary to establish compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement.

         Section 3.03.     Modification to Financing Documents. Nothing herein
shall restrict the right of any Creditor to amend, waive, consent to the
departure from or otherwise modify any Financing Documents to which it is a
party in accordance with the terms thereof.

the Company, each Obligated Party will promptly execute and deliver any and all
such further instruments and documentation and take such further action as the
Collateral Agent reasonably deems necessary or advisable in obtaining the full
benefits of this Agreement and the Security Documents and of the rights,
remedies and powers herein and therein conferred or reserved.

         Section 4.03.     Obligations Unimpaired. Except as expressly provided

or perform any obligation or liability owed to such Creditor when the same shall
become due and payable in accordance with the terms of the applicable Credit
Facility.

         Section 4.04.     No Additional Rights for the Company. If any Creditor
shall enforce its rights and remedies in violation of the terms of this
Agreement, each Obligated Party agrees that it shall not use such violation as a
defense to the enforcement by such Lender of any of its rights under any Credit
Facility or any other Financing Documents to which it is a party nor assert such
violation as a counterclaim or basis for setoff or recoupment against such
Creditor. Compliance with this Section 4.04 will not constitute a violation of
any other provisions of this Agreement by an Obligated Party.

         Section 4.05.     Set-Off Rights. Each Obligated Party agrees that
each Lender purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to Section
2.02 hereof, may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including Set-Off Rights) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
applicable Obligated Party in the amount of such participation.

         Section 4.06.     Postclosing Agreement. On or before October 15, 2003,
the Obligated Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent amendments, in form and substance
acceptable to the Collateral Agent, to the UCC financing statements filed
against Advanced Distributor Products and Lennox Hearth Products by Summit
Funding Group to limit the scope of each such financing statement to the actual
property subject to the transaction evidenced thereby.

                  (h)      to accept, execute, and deliver the Security

         Section 5.02.     Actions of Agent Requiring Consent, or Upon Request,
of the Required Lenders. Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the
Security Documents to the contrary, (a) the Collateral Agent shall not, without
the prior written consent of all the Lenders other than the Affiliates of any
Multiyear Lender (who shall have no right to object to any release or
substitution of Collateral), release or substitute any Collateral except as
permitted by Section 5.12, (b) the Collateral Agent shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Required Lenders, institute foreclosure proceedings with
respect to all or any portion of the Collateral, and (c) the Collateral Agent
shall not enter into any other amendment, modification or supplement of any of
the Security Documents without the prior written consent of the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that upon the Collateral Agent's receipt of the
prior written consent, or upon the written instruction, of the Required Lenders,
the Collateral Agent shall take such action as to which consent has been granted
or such instruction has been given. No Affiliate of any Multiyear Lender shall
have any right to be included in any consent required by this Section 5.02.

         Section 5.03.     Non-Reliance on Collateral Agent and Other Creditors.
Each Creditor agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Collateral Agent or any other Creditor, and based upon such

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 14

<PAGE>

documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis of the Obligated Parties and the Collateral, and its independent
decision to enter into this Agreement, and that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Collateral Agent or any other Creditor, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall not be required to keep the
Creditors informed as to the performance or observance by any Obligated Party
with the terms of this Agreement, the Pledge Agreement or any other Financing
Document or to inspect the properties or books of any Obligated Party. The
Collateral Agent shall not have any duty, responsibility or liability to provide
any Creditor with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of any Obligated Party which may come into the
possession of Collateral Agent; provided, however, the Collateral Agent shall
send to the Lenders written notice of any Event of Default of which it has been
given notice and all payments and repayments of amounts required hereunder to be
paid to the Lenders received by the Collateral Agent under or in connection with
the Security Documents or this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall provide
each Lender with a schedule of all costs and expenses which the Collateral Agent
has paid or proposes to pay from the proceeds of such payments or repayments as
permitted hereunder.

         Section 5.04.     Collateral Agent and Affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank
(formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank) and any successor Collateral Agent, in its
capacity as a Lender and an agent under the Multiyear Credit Agreement, shall
have the same rights and powers under the Financing Documents and may exercise
or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Collateral Agent
hereunder, and such Lender and its Affiliates may lend money to and generally
engage in any kind of lending, investment, trust, hedging or other business with
or for any Lender, any Obligated Party, or any of their respective Affiliates,
as if it were not acting as Collateral Agent hereunder.

         Section 5.05.     Action by Collateral Agent. The obligations of the
Collateral Agent hereunder and under the Security Documents are only those
expressly set forth herein and therein. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein or in any Financing Document to the contrary, the Collateral Agent shall
not be required to take any action with respect to any Default or Event of
Default, except as expressly provided herein.

         Section 5.06.     Consultation with Experts. The Collateral Agent may
consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and any other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts. Furthermore, the Collateral Agent (a) shall have no
duties or responsibilities except those set forth in this Agreement and the
other Security Documents and (b) shall not be required to initiate any
litigation, foreclosure or collection proceedings hereunder or under any
Security Document except to the extent requested by Required Lenders.

         Section 5.07.     Liability of Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any communication or document believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been communicated or signed by the Person by
whom it purports to be communicated or signed and shall not be liable to any
Creditor for any of the consequences of such reliance. Neither the Collateral
Agent nor any director, officer, employee or agent of the Collateral Agent shall
be liable for any action taken or not taken by it or them under, or in
connection with, this Agreement or any of the Financing Documents in the absence
of its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct. As to any matters not
expressly provided for herein, the Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from
acting in accordance with written instructions from the Required Lenders or, in
the absence of such instructions, in accordance with its discretion, taking into
account the interests of all Lenders. The Collateral Agent shall not be
obligated to follow any such written directions to the extent that it shall
determine that such directions are in conflict with any provision hereof or of
any applicable law or regulation or any Financing Document or which exposes the
Collateral Agent to personal liability. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Collateral Agent shall be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (a) any
statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any of

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 15

<PAGE>

the Financing Documents or any payment thereunder; (b) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any Obligated Party or any
Creditor under any of the Financing Documents; (c) the validity, effectiveness
or genuineness of the Financing Documents or any other instrument or writing
furnished in connection therewith; or (d) the existence, genuineness or value of
any of the Collateral or the validity, effectiveness, perfection, priority or
enforceability of the security interests in or liens on any of the Collateral.

         Section 5.08.     Indemnification of Collateral Agent; Defense of
Claims.

                  (a)      EACH LENDER HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY THE COLLATERAL
AGENT AND EACH OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT'S DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AFFILIATES,
REPRESENTATIVES AND AGENTS (AS USED IN THIS SECTION 5.08 "COLLATERAL AGENT"
MEANS ALL OF THE FOREGOING) AGAINST ALL LOSS, COST, LIABILITY AND EXPENSE (TO
THE EXTENT NOT PAID BY AN OBLIGATED PARTY AND NOT ARISING OUT OF OR AS A RESULT
OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT
BUT INCLUDING ALL LOSS, COST, LIABILITY AND EXPENSE ARISING OUT OF OR AS A
RESULT OF THE NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT), INCLUDING
REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES, RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN OR TO BE TAKEN BY IT
AS COLLATERAL AGENT ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ITS AUTHORITY
AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS, TO THE EXTENT OF
SUCH LENDER'S PRO RATA SHARE (BASED UPON ITS SHARING PERCENTAGE) OF ANY SUCH
LOSS, COST, LIABILITY AND EXPENSE.

                  (b)      The Collateral Agent shall notify each Lender (but
excluding any Affiliate of a Multiyear Lender) as promptly as is reasonably
practicable of the written assertion of, or the commencement of, any claim,
suit, action or proceeding filed against the Collateral Agent arising out of, or
in connection with, the acceptance or administration of the duties imposed upon
the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any of the Financing Documents or any
action or omission taken or made within the scope of the rights or powers
conferred upon the Collateral Agent hereunder or under the Financing Documents
promptly after the Collateral Agent shall have received the written assertion or
have been served with the summons or other first legal process giving
information as to the nature and basis of the lawsuit. Each Lender shall be
entitled to participate in and assume, at its own expense, the defense of any
such claim, suit, action or proceeding, and such defense shall be conducted by
counsel chosen by such Lender and reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral
Agent, provided, however, that (i) if any Lender has not assumed the defense of
such claim, suit, action or proceeding, (ii) if the attorneys handling the
defense are not reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, or (iii) if the
defendants in any such action include both the Collateral Agent and the Lenders
and the Collateral Agent shall have been advised by its counsel that there may
be legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to the Lenders, which in the reasonable opinion of such counsel are
sufficient to make it undesirable for the same counsel to represent both the
Lenders and the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to
employ its own counsel in all such instances described in (i), (ii) or (iii)
above, and shall be entitled to recover from any proceeds received pursuant to
Section 2.06 all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. If more than one
Lender gives notice of assumption of defense, the matter shall be presented to
all the Lenders and, unless the Collateral Agent receives notice from the
Required Lenders specifying the Lender that is to assume the defense, the
Collateral Agent shall proceed itself with the defense. Except as provided
above, the Collateral Agent's right to recover its reasonable counsel fees and
expenses from proceeds received pursuant to Section 2.06 shall cease upon any
Lender's assumption of the defense of the claim, suit, action or proceeding.
Each Lender and the Collateral Agent is always entitled to defend itself at its
own expense. Neither the Lenders nor the Collateral Agent shall be bound by any
settlement entered into by the other parties without such party's consent.

         Section 5.09.     Resignation or Removal of Collateral Agent. Subject
to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent as provided
below, the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 16

<PAGE>

giving notice thereof to each Lender and may be removed, upon thirty days' prior
written notice of such removal from the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, a successor Collateral Agent may be appointed by the
Required Lenders. If no successor Collateral Agent shall have been appointed as
aforesaid and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Collateral Agent's giving of notice of resignation or having received
notice of removal, then the retiring Collateral Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Collateral Agent which shall be a depository
institution with capital and surplus greater than $500,000,000 and which shall
be qualified to perform its duties hereunder and under the Security Documents.

         Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent hereunder by
a successor Collateral Agent, such successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Collateral Agent, and the retiring Collateral Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement or any Security
Document, except to the extent for acts or omissions prior to the resignation or
removal. After any retiring Collateral Agent's resignation or removal hereunder
as Collateral Agent, (a) the provisions of Sections 5.07 and 5.08 shall continue
in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was acting as Collateral Agent, (b) any Collateral held in
possession of the retiring Collateral Agent shall be delivered to the successor
Collateral Agent, and (c) the retiring Collateral Agent shall assign all of its
rights as secured party with respect to all of the Collateral to the successor
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Creditors.

         Section 5.10.     Appointment of Co-Agents. At any time or times, in
order to comply with any legal requirement in any jurisdiction, the Collateral
Agent may appoint a bank or trust company or one or more other Persons, either
to act as co-agent or co-agents, jointly with the Collateral Agent, or to act as
separate agent or agents on behalf of the Lenders with such power and authority
as may be necessary for the effectual operation of the provisions hereof and may
be specified in the instrument of appointment (which may, in the discretion of
the Collateral Agent, include provisions for the protection of such co-agent or
separate agent similar to the provisions of this Article 5).

         Section 5.11.     Compensation of Collateral Agent; Expenses. The
Collateral Agent agrees to serve hereunder without compensation except for the
reimbursement of its customary custodial fees charged for the safekeeping of the
certificates evidencing the stock pledged as collateral under the Pledge
Agreement. Any successor Collateral Agent appointed pursuant to Section 5.09
shall be compensated by the Company on a basis which shall be approved by the
Required Lenders. The Lenders agree that such compensation paid to any successor
Collateral Agent and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Collateral Agent or
such successor Collateral Agent on behalf of the Creditors incident to the
exercise or enforcement of any terms or provisions of the Security Documents
shall be indebtedness to the Collateral Agent or such successor Collateral
Agent, secured by the Collateral. Upon the request of the Collateral Agent or
such successor Collateral Agent, however, the Lenders will reimburse the
Collateral Agent or such successor Collateral Agent, to the extent not paid by
the Obligated Parties, for any such fees or expenses in accordance with each
Lender's Sharing Percentage.

         Section 5.12.     Release of Collateral. The Company may from time to
time request the Collateral Agent in writing, with copies thereof delivered
simultaneously to all Lenders (other than the Affiliates of Multiyear Lenders),
to release portions of the Collateral, if and to the extent such Collateral is
required to be released in connection with any sale of Collateral that is
permitted under the Credit Facilities. Promptly after the Collateral Agent
receives (a) such written request from the Company and (b) written notice from
the Required Lenders that the proposed disposition is permitted under the terms
of the Credit Facilities, then if no Default or Event of Default exists (as
certified to the Collateral Agent by the Company and absent any express actual
knowledge to the contrary of the officers of the Collateral Agent who are
involved with the proposed release of Collateral) the Collateral Agent shall
release such Collateral. If all the Obligations arising under the Multiyear
Credit Agreement and Obligated Party Swap Agreements have been paid and
satisfied in full and the

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 17

<PAGE>

commitments thereunder terminated, the Company may request the Collateral Agent
in writing, with copies thereof delivered simultaneously to all Noteholders, to
release all of the Collateral. Promptly after the Collateral Agent receives (a)
such written request from the Company and (b) written notice from the
Noteholders that the proposed release is permitted (which notice the Noteholders
agree to deliver if no Default or Event of Default exists, no other creditors of
the Company enjoy the benefits of collateral or guaranties to secure the amounts
owed by the Company other than purchase money lenders and holders of capital
leases and all other conditions to the release of the Note Guaranties under the
Note Agreements have been satisfied), then if no Default or Event of Default
exists the Collateral Agent shall release all the Collateral. If the proposed
sale or release of the Collateral is not permitted by the Credit Facilities or
hereby, the Collateral Agent may only release the Collateral upon the written
consent of all the Lenders (excluding, however, the Affiliates of any Multiyear
Lender).

         Section 5.13.     Emergency Actions. The Collateral Agent, is
authorized, but not obligated, to take any action reasonably required to perfect
or continue the perfection of the security interests in the Collateral for the
benefit of the Creditors and following the occurrence of an Event of Default and
before the Required Lenders have given the Collateral Agent directions, to take
any action (subject to the restrictions in Section 5.02) which the Collateral
Agent, in its sole discretion and good faith, believes to be reasonably required
to promote and protect the interests of the Lenders and to maximize both the
value of the Collateral and the present value of the recovery by the Lenders on
the Obligations; provided, however, that once such directions have been
received, the actions of the Collateral Agent shall be governed thereby and the
Collateral Agent shall not take any further action which would be contrary
thereto. The Collateral Agent shall give written notice of any such action to
the Lenders within one Business Day and shall cease any such action upon its
receipt of written instructions from the Required Lenders.

         Section 5.14.     Interpleader; Declaratory Judgment. In the event any
controversy arises between or among the Lenders with respect to this Agreement,
the Security Documents or any rights of any Creditor hereunder or thereunder,
the Collateral Agent shall have the right to institute a bill of interpleader in
any court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any amounts held by the
Collateral Agent hereunder or to initiate proceedings in any court of competent
jurisdiction for a declaratory judgment to determine the rights of the parties.

                                   ARTICLE 6.

                            Enforcement of Remedies

         Section 6.01.     Waivers of Rights. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth herein, so long as the Obligations remain unpaid, the Creditors (other
than the Collateral Agent) hereby agree to refrain from exercising any and all
rights each may individually (i.e., other than through the Collateral Agent) now
or hereafter have applicable to the Collateral to exercise any right pursuant to
the Security Documents, the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any
applicable jurisdiction, or under similar provisions of the laws of any
jurisdiction or otherwise dispose of or retain any of the Collateral. The
Creditors (other than the Collateral Agent) hereby agree not to take any action
whatsoever to enforce any term or provision of the Security Documents or to
enforce any right with respect to the Collateral, in conflict with this
Agreement or the terms and provisions of the Security Documents.

         Section 6.02.     Permitted Action by the Lenders. Any Creditor may
(but in no event shall be required to), without instruction from the Collateral
Agent, take action permitted by applicable law or in accordance with the terms
of the Security Documents to preserve its rights, security interests and liens
in any item of Collateral securing the payment and performance of the
Obligations, including but not limited to curing any default or alleged default
under any contract entered into by any Obligated Party, paying any tax, fee or
expense on behalf of any Obligated Party, exercising any offset or recoupment
rights and paying insurance

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 18

<PAGE>

premiums on behalf of any Obligated Party so long as such action shall not
impair the rights of the Collateral Agent or of any other Creditor.

         Section 6.03.     Right to Instruct Collateral Agent. Upon Acceleration
under a Credit Facility, the Required Lenders may instruct the Collateral Agent
to liquidate all or any portion of the Collateral, and to take any other action,
in the manner, and upon the terms and conditions, described in the Security
Documents.

         Section 6.04.     Permitted Exercise of other Rights. Except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Article 6, each Creditor shall have all
the rights and remedies available to them under the Financing Documents to which
they are a party upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default or at
any other time, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Creditor shall have the independent right, exercised in accordance with the
applicable Financing Documents and applicable law, to do any of the following:

                  (a)      accelerate the Obligations owing to such Creditor
pursuant to the Financing Documents (other than this Agreement and the Security
Documents) to which such Creditor is a party;

                  (b)      institute suit against any Obligated Party (i) under
the terms of the applicable Financing Documents (including the Guaranties but
excluding this Agreement and the Security Documents) for collection of the
amounts owing thereunder or (ii) seeking an injunction, restraining order or any
other similar remedy;

                  (c)      seek the appointment of a receiver for any Obligated
Party (but not any of the Collateral);

                  (d)      file an involuntary petition under any bankruptcy or
insolvency laws against any Obligated Party or file a proof of claim in any
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

                  (e)      exercise any Set-Off Right; or

                  (f)      take any other enforcement action with respect to any
Default or Event of Default pursuant to and in accordance with the Financing
Documents (other than this Agreement and the Security Documents) to which it is
a party.

If any Creditor obtains any payment of any Obligations owed as a result of the
exercise of any right or remedy permitted by this Section 6.04, such Creditor
shall comply with its obligations under Section 2.02 or Section 2.07 hereof (as
applicable) with respect thereto.

                                   ARTICLE 7.

                      Successors and Assigns; New Parties

         Section 7.01.     Assignees. No provision of this Agreement shall
restrict in any manner the assignment, participation or other transfer by any
Creditor (other than the Collateral Agent) of all or any part of its right,
title or interest under any Credit Facility; provided that, unless the
transferee becomes a party hereto for purposes hereof in accordance with Section
7.02, the transferor shall remain responsible for performance of this Agreement
with respect to the interest transferred, all as more fully set forth herein,
and the Collateral Agent shall have no responsibilities to and need not
acknowledge the interests of such transferee.

         Section 7.02.     Assignees of the Creditors. In connection with an
assignment of all, or of a proportionate part of all, of a Creditor's right,
title and interest under any Credit Facility to any insurance company, bank or
other financial institution (a "PURCHASER"), all in accordance with the
applicable provisions

AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, Page 19

hereunder entitled to share in the Reallocable Payments and the Collateral and
any administrative agent appointed by such Lender may become a "Creditor") upon
the receipt by the Collateral Agent of a Supplement to Intercreditor Agreement

Insurance Company of North America, which has been a Noteholder since 1993, was
not party to the Original Intercreditor Agreement but is a Lender under this
Agreement and is entitled to the benefits hereof.

         Section 7.04.     Addition of New Material Subsidiaries. Within forty -

Note Agreements) created or acquired during such fiscal quarter, and each
Domestic Subsidiary that, as a result of a change in assets, becomes a Material
Subsidiary during such fiscal quarter (any such Material Subsidiary, herein a
"NEW MATERIAL SUBSIDIARY"), to execute and deliver a joinder agreement joining
it as a guarantor under the Guaranties. Simultaneously with the execution and
delivery of any such joinder agreement, the Company shall cause the New Material
Subsidiary to join into this Agreement and become a "Guarantor" hereunder by the
execution and delivery of a Supplement to Intercreditor Agreement substantially
in the form of Attachment C hereto.

                                   ARTICLE 8.

         Section 8.05.     Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers; Amendment
and Restatement. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO HEREIN
EMBODY THE FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO AND SUPERSEDE ANY
AND ALL PRIOR COMMITMENTS, AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL INTERCREDITOR
AGREEMENT), REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERSTANDINGS, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL,
RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS
OF THE PARTIES HERETO. THERE ARE NO ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO.
Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (and, if
the rights or duties of the Collateral Agent are affected thereby, by the
Collateral Agent); provided that no amendment, waiver or other modification
shall without the consent of all the Lenders (other than the Affiliate of any
Multiyear Lender who shall have no right to consent to any amendment, waiver or
other modification) modify the terms of Section 5.12 or this Section 8.05 or
release any Collateral except as permitted by Section 5.12. This Agreement
amends and restates in its entirety the Original Intercreditor Agreement. Each
Obligated Party that was a party to the Original Intercreditor Agreement prior
to the date hereof represents and warrants that as of the date hereof there are
no claims or offsets against or defenses or counterclaims to its obligations
under the Original Intercreditor Agreement or any of the other documents
executed in connection therewith. To induce the Creditors and the Collateral
Agent to enter into this Agreement, each such Obligated Party waives any and all
such claims, offsets, defenses or counterclaims, whether known or unknown,
arising prior to the date hereof and relating to the Original Intercreditor
Agreement, Security Documents, the Credit Facilities or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Creditor that is a party to the 364 Day
Credit Agreement (as that term is defined in the Original Intercreditor
Agreement) agrees that as a result of the expiration of the commitments under
the 364 Day Credit Agreement and the repayment of the obligations thereunder:
(i) the Original Intercreditor Agreement may be modified to exclude the 364 Day
Credit Agreement and the lenders thereunder, in their capacity as such, from the
benefits of the Original Intercreditor Agreement and of this Agreement, as an
amendment and restatement thereof and (ii) this Agreement may be amended or
otherwise modified without the consent or agreement of any lender party to the
364 Day Credit Agreement acting solely in their capacity as such.

         Section 8.06.     Payments. All payments hereunder shall be made in
Dollars in immediately available funds. All payments to the Collateral Agent
shall be made to it at such office or account as it may specify for the purpose
by notice to the Lenders. All payments to any Creditor shall be made to it, to
the extent practicable, in accordance with the provisions of the Credit
Facilities.

         Section 8.07.     Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, and
all of which taken together shall constitute a single agreement, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when the Collateral Agent shall have
received counterparts hereof executed by each of the parties listed on the
signature pages hereof.

         Section 8.08.     Benefits. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
and shall be binding upon the Obligated Parties, the Lenders, the Collateral
Agent and the other Creditors and their successors or assigns, and no other
Person shall have any right, benefit, priority or interest under or by reason of
this Agreement. No Obligated Party may assign their rights or obligations
hereunder without the consent of all the Lenders. Any Affiliate of a Multiyear
Lender that is a party to any Obligated Party Swap Agreement is bound by the
terms hereof. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, each Multiyear Lender, an
Affiliate of whom is a party to any Obligated Party Swap Agreement, shall ensure
that such Affiliate complies with the terms hereof as if such Affiliate was a
Lender hereunder and bound by the terms hereof.

         Section 8.09.     No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure on the
part of any Creditor to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of
dealing with respect to, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or
any Security Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or any
Security Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies provided for in
this Agreement and the Security Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights and remedies provided by law.

         Section 8.10.     Term. This Agreement shall terminate upon the
occurrence of the following events if no Default or Event of Default then
exists: (i) the irrevocable payment in full of the Obligations under the
Multiyear Credit Agreement and the Obligated Party Swap Agreements (provided,
however, this Agreement shall be reinstated if any such payment is required to
be returned by any Creditor); (ii) no Lender shall have any commitment to lend
or otherwise extend credit under any Credit Agreement; and (iii) the release of
the liens on the Collateral in accordance with Section 5.12 or otherwise. If an
Event of Default has occurred which has not been cured or waived, this Agreement
shall terminate only upon the occurrence of the following events: (i) the
irrevocable payment in full of the Obligations (provided, however, this
Agreement shall be reinstated if any such payment is required to be returned by
any Creditor); (ii) no Lender shall have any commitment to lend or otherwise
extend credit under any Credit Facility; and (iii) the release of the liens on
the Collateral or the total liquidation of the Collateral and the distribution
of all the proceeds in accordance herewith. Without prejudice to the survival of
any other obligations hereunder, the indemnification and reimbursement
obligations of the Obligated Parties under Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of this
Agreement and the obligations of the Lenders under Section 5.11 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.

         Section 8.11.     Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.

         Section 8.12.     Limitation of Liability. Neither the Collateral Agent
nor any affiliate, officer, director, employee, attorney, or agent thereof shall
have any liability with respect to, and each Obligated Party and each other
Creditor hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any
claim for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages
suffered or incurred by any Obligated Party or any other Creditor in connection
with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement or any of the
other Financing Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents.

         Section 8.13.     Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable shall not
impair or invalidate the remainder of this Agreement and the effect thereof
shall be confined to the provision held to be invalid or illegal.

         Section 8.14.     Headings. The headings, captions, and arrangements
used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the
interpretation of this Agreement.

         Section 8.15.     Construction. Each Obligated Party and each Creditor
acknowledge that each of them has had the benefit of legal counsel of its own
choice and has been afforded an opportunity to review this Agreement with its
legal counsel and that this Agreement shall be construed as if jointly drafted
by the parties hereto.

         Section 8.16.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES

EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed by their respective officers hereunto duly authorized as of the

shall receive: (i) any stock certificate (including, without limitation, any
certificate representing a stock dividend or a distribution in connection with
any reclassification, increase, or reduction of capital or issued in connection

substitution of, or in exchange for any Collateral; or (ii) subject to the right

other property distributed upon or in respect of the Collateral pursuant to any
recapitalization or reclassification of the capital of the issuer thereof or
pursuant to any reorganization of the issuer thereof; or (c) any other

Pledgor shall consent to or approve the issuance of any additional shares of any
class of capital stock or any additional ownership interest of the issuer of any

commitments entitling any Person to purchase or otherwise acquire any such
shares or any additional ownership interest (any of the foregoing herein an
"Equity Right"); provided however, a Pledgor may consent to or approve the
issuance of any Equity Right if such Equity Right is permitted to be issued
under the terms of the Credit Facilities and if such Equity Right is granted to
such Pledgor and is delivered to Secured Party as additional Collateral in
accordance with the terms hereof to secure the obligations secured hereby. If
any of the Collateral consists of interests in a partnership or limited
liability company, it shall not permit such interest to be evidenced by a
certificate (except for those interests evidenced by a certificate as of the
date hereof as described on the Schedules hereto or to become a "security"
governed by the provisions of Article 8 of the UCC).

         Section 3.05. Additional Pledged Collateral. Each Pledgor shall pledge
hereunder, immediately upon its acquisition thereof, any and all additional
shares of stock, other certificates or other instruments evidencing Collateral.
Each Pledgor agrees that it will, upon obtaining any additional shares of stock,
other certificates or other instruments required to be pledged hereunder as
provided in this Section 3.05 or Section 3.03 or Section 3.04 or which is
otherwise required to be pledged hereunder under the terms of the Financing
Documents, promptly (and in any event within fifteen Business Days) deliver to
Secured Party a Pledge Amendment, duly executed by such Pledgor, in
substantially the form of Schedule 3 annexed hereto (a "Pledge Amendment"), in
respect of the additional property to be pledged pursuant to this Agreement.
Each Pledgor hereby authorizes Secured Party to attach each Pledge Amendment to
this Agreement and agrees that all property listed on any Pledge Amendment
delivered to Secured Party shall for all purposes hereunder be considered
Collateral; provided that the failure of any Pledgor to execute a Pledge
Amendment with respect to any additional property pledged pursuant to this
Agreement shall not impair the security interest of Secured Party therein or
otherwise adversely affect the rights and remedies of Secured Party hereunder
with respect thereto.

         Section 3.06. Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time,
upon the reasonable request of Secured Party, and at the sole expense of the

documentation and take such further action as Secured Party may deem necessary
or desirable to preserve and perfect its security interest in the Collateral and
carry out the provisions and purposes of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the execution and filing of such financing statements as Secured
Party may require (the Secured Party is hereby authorized to file without the
consent or approval of any Pledgor, any financing statement naming it as Secured
Party and such Pledgor as the Debtor which describes the Pledgor's Collateral).

         Section 3.07. Sale of Collateral. No Pledgor shall sell, assign, or
otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof without the prior
written consent of all the Lenders or except as permitted by the Financing
Documents.

         Section 3.08. Corporate Changes. No Pledgor shall change its name,
identity, or corporate structure in any manner that might make any financing
statement filed in connection with this Agreement seriously misleading, in
Secured Party's judgment, unless such Pledgor shall have given Secured Party
thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof and shall have taken all action
deemed necessary or desirable by Secured Party to make each financing statement
not seriously misleading. No Pledgor shall change its principal place of
business, chief executive office or jurisdiction of organization unless it shall
have given Secured Party thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof and
shall have taken all action deemed necessary or desirable by Secured Party to
cause its security interest in the Collateral to be protected and perfected with
the priority required by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
delivery of a legal opinion satisfactory to the Secured Party as to the
continued perfection and priority of the security interest hereby created.

                                   ARTICLE 4.

Collateral or any part thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any
Collateral; (v) to participate in the defense of, or if a Pledgor fails to
defend, to defend any suit, action, or proceeding brought against Pledgor with
respect to any Collateral; (vi) to settle, compromise, or adjust any suit,
action, or proceeding described in clauses (iv) or (v) above, and, in connection
therewith, to give such discharges or releases as Secured Party may deem
appropriate; (vii) to exchange any of the Collateral for other property upon any
merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, or other readjustment
of the issuer thereof and, in connection therewith, deposit any of the
Collateral with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar, or other
designated agency upon such terms as Secured Party may determine; and (viii) to
sell, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal
with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though Secured Party were
the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to do, at Secured Party's
option and the Pledgor's expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts
and things which Secured Party deems necessary to protect, preserve, or realize
upon the Collateral and Secured Party's security interest therein.

         THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY IS A POWER COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE
IRREVOCABLE. Secured Party shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the
exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or
implicitly granted to Secured Party in this Agreement, and Secured Party shall
not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. Secured Party
shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any
mistake of fact or law in its individual capacity or in its capacity as
attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. This power of attorney is conferred on Secured Party solely
to protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral.

         Section 4.02. Voting Rights. Unless an Event of Default exists, each
Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights pertaining to
the Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement, any Credit Facility or the Intercreditor Agreement.
Secured Party shall execute and deliver to the Pledgors all such proxies and
other instruments as any Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of
enabling such Pledgor to exercise the voting rights which it is entitled to
exercise pursuant to this Section.

         Section 4.03. Dividends. Unless an Event of Default exists, the
Pledgors shall be entitled to receive and retain any dividends paid on the
Collateral in cash to the extent and only to the extent that such dividends are
permitted by the Credit Facilities and applicable law.

         Section 4.04. Secured Party's Duty of Care. Other than the exercise of
reasonable care in the physical custody of the Collateral while held by Secured
Party hereunder, Secured Party shall have no responsibility for or obligation or
duty with respect to all or any part of the Collateral or any matter or
proceeding arising out of or relating thereto, including, without limitation,
any obligation or duty to collect any sums due in respect thereof or to protect
or preserve any rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining
thereto, it being understood and agreed that the Pledgors shall be responsible
for preservation of all rights in the Collateral. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Secured Party shall be conclusively deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody of the Collateral if Secured Party
takes such action, for purposes of preserving rights in the Collateral, as any
Pledgor may reasonably request in writing, but no failure or omission or delay
by Secured Party in complying with any such request by a Pledgor, and no refusal
by Secured Party to comply with any such request by such Pledgor, shall be
deemed to be a failure to exercise reasonable care.

                                    Default

         Section 5.01. Rights and Remedies. If any Event of Default occurs,
Secured Party shall have the following rights and remedies:

                  (a)      In addition to all other rights and remedies granted
to Secured Party in this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and in any other
instrument or agreement securing, evidencing, or relating to any of the
obligations secured hereby, Secured Party shall have all of the rights and
remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by the
State of Texas or of a creditor with a lien or charge on the Collateral under
the laws of the jurisdiction of the organization of the issuer of any of the
Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Secured Party may
(i) without demand or notice to any Pledgor, collect, receive, or take
possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, (ii) sell or otherwise dispose
of the Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at public or
private sale or sales, at Secured Party's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on
credit, or for future delivery and/or (iii) bid and become a purchaser at any
public (or private, to the extent permitted by applicable law) sale free of any
right or equity of redemption in any Pledgor, which right or equity is hereby
expressly waived and released by such Pledgor. Upon the request of Secured
Party, a Pledgor shall assemble the Collateral not already in the possession of
Secured Party and make it available to Secured Party at any place designated by
Secured Party that is reasonably convenient to such Pledgor and Secured Party.
Each Pledgor agrees that Secured Party shall not be obligated to give more than
ten (10) days prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale or
of the time after which any private sale may take place and that such notice
shall constitute reasonable notice of such matters; provided, however, if any of
the Collateral threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type
customarily sold on a recognized market, Secured Party may sell or otherwise
dispose of the Collateral without notification of any kind. Secured Party shall
not be obligated to make any sale of the Collateral regardless of notice of sale
having been given. Secured Party may adjourn any public or private sale from
time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale
may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned. Each Pledgor shall be liable for all reasonable expenses of retaking,
holding, preparing for sale, or the like, and all reasonable attorneys' fees and
other expenses incurred by Secured Party in connection with the collection of
the obligations secured hereby and the enforcement of Secured Party's rights
under this Agreement, all of which expenses and fees shall constitute additional
obligations secured by this Agreement. Secured Party may apply the Collateral
against the obligations secured hereby in such order and manner as Secured Party
may determine in its discretion subject however, to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Company shall remain liable for any deficiency if
the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to
pay the obligations secured hereby. Each Pledgor waives all rights of marshaling
in respect of the Collateral.

                  (b)      Secured Party may cause any or all of the Collateral
held by it to be transferred into the name of Secured Party or the name or names
of Secured Party's nominee or nominees.

                  (c)      Secured Party may collect or receive all money or
property at any time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any
of the Collateral, but shall be under no obligation to do so.

                  (d)      Secured Party shall have the right, but shall not be
obligated to, exercise or cause to be exercised all voting, consensual and other
powers of ownership pertaining to the Collateral, and Pledgor shall deliver to
Secured Party, if requested by Secured Party, irrevocable proxies with respect
to the Collateral in form satisfactory to Secured Party.

                  (e)      Each Pledgor hereby acknowledges and confirms that
Secured Party may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the
Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities

AMENDED AND RESTATED PLEDGE AGREEMENT, Page 6

<PAGE>

Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state or foreign securities laws and may
be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted
group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to
acquire any shares of the Collateral for their own respective accounts for
investment and not with a view to distribution or resale thereof. Each Pledgor
further acknowledges and confirms that any such private sale may result in
prices or other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a
public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such
private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable
manner, and Secured Party shall be under no obligation to take any steps in
order to permit the Collateral to be sold at a public sale. Secured Party shall
be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Collateral for any period
of time necessary to permit any issuer thereof to register such Collateral for
public sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under applicable
state or foreign securities laws.

                                   ARTICLE 6.

                                  Miscellaneous

         Section 6.01. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Pledgors and Secured Party and their
respective successors and assigns, except that no Pledgor may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Lenders.

the consent of the Required Lenders except as otherwise provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement; provided that no amendment, waiver or other
modification shall without the consent of all the Lenders modify the terms of
Section 3.07 or this Section 6.02.

         Section 6.03. Notices. All notices and other communications provided
for in this Agreement shall be given or made in accordance with the Multiyear
Credit Agreement.

         Section 6.04. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas and the applicable
laws of the United States of America.

         Section 6.05. Headings. The headings, captions and arrangements used in
this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation
of this Agreement.

         Section 6.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and on telecopy counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
