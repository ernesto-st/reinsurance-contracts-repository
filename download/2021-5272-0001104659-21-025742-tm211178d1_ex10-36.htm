of Company employees for twelve (12) months following the Termination, and (y) in the case of an involuntary Termination without
Cause or resignation for Good Reason of any Participant who is eligible to participate in the American International Group, Inc.

would have vested during such period will be forfeited, and (ii) with respect to all other Awards, the delivery of Shares (or cash)
with respect to such calendar year will be forfeited; <I>provided</I>, <I>further</I>, that if the local laws of a country or non-U.S.
jurisdiction in which Participant performs services render invalid or unenforceable all or a portion of the Release (subject to

and defend any such action, suit or proceeding and, once the Company gives notice of its intent to assume the defense, the Company

the taxable year in which the Covered Person incurred such expenses; and (3) in no event shall any right to reimbursement be subject

to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or other final adjudication, in either case, not subject
to further appeal, determines that the acts or omissions of such Covered Person giving rise to the indemnification claim resulted
from such Covered Person&rsquo;s bad faith, fraud or willful misconduct. The foregoing right of indemnification will not be exclusive
of any other rights of indemnification to which Covered Persons may be entitled under AIG&rsquo;s Amended and Restated Certificate

Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, any dispute, controversy or claim between the Company and a Participant, arising out

procedures determined by the Committee. Either the Company or a Participant may seek injunctive relief from the arbitrator.&nbsp;
