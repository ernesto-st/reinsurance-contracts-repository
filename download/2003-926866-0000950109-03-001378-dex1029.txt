          to but not including the next Payment Date.

     (iii) Borrower shall pay to Lender all other sums, not including scheduled

principal balance of either the Note or the Defeased Note), and in amounts equal
to the scheduled payments due on such dates under the Note or the Defeased Note,

Borrower shall assume the obligations under the Note or the Defeased Note, as

<PAGE>

are or may become a lien prior to, or of equal priority with, the Liens created
by the Loan Documents.

          (g) No Bankruptcy Filing. No Individual Borrower is contemplating
either the filing of a petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or
insolvency laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of its assets or
property, and no Individual Borrower has knowledge of any Person contemplating
the filing of any such petition against it.

          (h) Full and Accurate Disclosure. To the best of Borrower's knowledge,
no statement of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other
Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make statements contained herein or therein
not misleading. There is no material fact presently known to Borrower which has
not been disclosed to Lender which materially adversely affects, nor as far as
Borrower can foresee, might materially adversely affect, the Properties or the
business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of any Individual
Borrower.

          (i) No Plan Assets. No Individual Borrower is an "employee benefit
plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title I of ERISA, and
none of the assets of any Individual Borrower constitutes or will constitute
"plan assets" of one or more such plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section
2510.3-101.

          (j) Compliance. Each Individual Borrower and each Property and the use
thereof comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements,
including building and zoning ordinances and codes. No Individual Borrower is in
default or violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any
Governmental Authority, the violation of which might materially adversely affect
the condition (financial or otherwise) or business of an Individual Borrower.
There has not been and shall never be committed by any Individual Borrower,
Lessee or any other person in occupancy of or involved with the operation or use
of any Property any act or omission affording the federal government or any
state or local government the right of forfeiture as against any Property or any
part thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's obligations under
any of the Loan Documents. Borrower hereby covenants and agrees not to commit,
permit or suffer to exist any act or omission affording such right of
forfeiture.

          (k) Survey. The survey for each Property delivered to Lender in
connection with this Agreement does not fail to reflect any material matter
affecting such Property or the title thereto.

          (1) Financial Information. All financial data, including the
statements of cash flow and income and operating expense, that have been
delivered to Lender in respect of the Properties (i) are true, complete and
correct in all material respects, (ii) accurately represent the financial
condition of the Properties as of the date of such reports, and (iii) to the
extent prepared by an independent certified public accounting firm, have been
prepared in, accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods
covered, except as disclosed therein. No Individual Borrower has any contingent
liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or
unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments that are known

                                       28

<PAGE>

to Borrower and reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on any
Property or the operation thereof, except as referred to or reflected in said
financial statements. Since the date of such financial statements, there has
been no materially adverse change in the financial condition, operations or
business of any Individual Borrower from that set forth in said financial
statements.

          (m) Condemnation. No Condemnation or other proceeding has been
commenced or, to Borrower's best knowledge, is contemplated with respect to all
or any portion of any Property or for the relocation of roadways providing
access to any Property.

          (n) Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of the Loan
will be used for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring any "margin stock"
within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System or for any other purpose which would be inconsistent with such
Regulation U or any other Regulations of such Board of Governors, or for any
purposes prohibited by Legal Requirements or by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

          (o) Utilities and Public Access. Each Property has rights of access to
public ways and is served by water, sewer, sanitary sewer and storm drain
facilities adequate to service such Property for its respective intended uses.
All public utilities presently servicing the Properties enter the Properties
through public rights-of-way abutting the Properties or through valid easements
insured by the Title Insurance Policy. All roads necessary for the use of each
Property for its current purpose have been completed and dedicated to public use
and accepted by all Governmental Authorities or valid easements insured by the
Title Insurance Policy for such roads or access easements have been obtained.

          (p) Not a Foreign Person. No Individual Borrower is a "foreign person"
within the meaning of (S)1445(f)(3) of the Code.

          (q) Separate Lots. Each Property is comprised of one (1) or more
parcels which constitutes a separate tax lot and does not constitute a portion
of any other tax lot not a part of such Property.

          (r) Assessments. To the best of Borrower's knowledge, there are no
pending or proposed special or other assessments for public improvements or
otherwise affecting any Property, nor are there any contemplated improvements to
any Property that may result in such special or other assessments.

          (s) Enforceability. The Loan Documents are not subject to any right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense by any Individual Borrower,
including the defense of usury, nor would the exercise of any of the terms of
the Loan Documents, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Loan
Documents unenforceable, and Borrower has not asserted any right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense with respect thereto.

                                       29

<PAGE>

          (t) No Prior Assignment. There are no prior assignments of the Leases
by Borrower or Lessee or any portion of the Rents due and payable or to become
due and payable which are presently outstanding.

          (u) Insurance. Borrower has obtained and has delivered to Lender
insurance policies reflecting the insurance coverages, amounts and other
requirements set forth in this Agreement.

          (v) Use of Properties. Each Property is used exclusively for hotel and
other appurtenant and related uses.

          (w) Certificate of Occupancy; Licenses. All certifications, permits,
licenses and approvals, including certificates of completion and occupancy
permits and any applicable liquor licenses required for the legal use, occupancy
and operation of each Property as presently being used (collectively, the
"Licenses"), have been obtained and are in full force and effect. Borrower shall
keep and maintain or cause to be kept and maintained all licenses necessary for
the operation of each Property. The use being made of each Property is in
conformity with the certificate of occupancy issued for such Property.

          (x) Flood Zone. Except as identified on Schedule 2, none of the
Improvements on any Property are located in an area as identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency as an area having special flood hazards.

          (y) Physical Condition. Each Property, including all buildings,
improvements, parking facilities, sidewalks, storm drainage systems, roofs,
plumbing systems, HVAC systems, fire protection systems, electrical systems,
equipment, elevators, exterior sidings and doors, landscaping, irrigation
systems and all structural components, are in good condition, order and repair
in all material respects; there exists no structural or other material defects
or damages in any Property, whether latent or otherwise. Borrower has not
received notice from any insurance company or bonding company of any defects or
inadequacies in any Property, or any part thereof, which would adversely affect
the insurability of the same or cause the imposition of extraordinary premiums
or charges thereon or of any termination or threatened termination of any policy
of insurance or bond.

          (z) Appraised Value. Except as shown on the surveys for the Properties
delivered to Lender, all of the improvements which were included in determining
the appraised value of any Property lie wholly within the boundaries and
building restriction lines of such Property, and no improvements on adjoining
properties encroach upon any Property, and no easements or other encumbrances
upon any Property encroach upon any of the improvements, so as to affect the
value or marketability of any Property except those which are insured against by
title insurance.

          (aa) Leases. The only Leases affecting the Properties are the
Operating Leases.

          (bb) Filing and Recording Taxes. All transfer taxes, deed stamps,
intangible taxes or other amounts in the nature of transfer taxes required to be
paid by any Person under applicable

                                       30

<PAGE>

Legal Requirements currently in effect in connection with the transfer of the
Properties to Borrower have been paid. All mortgage, mortgage recording, stamp,
intangible or other similar tax required to be paid by any Person under
applicable Legal Requirements currently in effect in connection with the
execution, delivery, recordation, filing, registration, perfection or
enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, including the Mortgages, have been
paid and, under current Legal Requirements, each Mortgage is enforceable against
Borrower in accordance with its respective terms by Lender (or any subsequent
holder thereof), except as such enforceability may be limited by insolvency,
bankruptcy, moratorium or other laws affecting creditor's remedies in general
and principles of equity.

          (cc) Single-Purpose. Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Lender
as of the date hereof and covenants with Lender that until such time as the Debt
shall be paid in full:

     (i)  Each Individual Borrower does not and will not own any encumbered
          asset or property other than (A) the Properties, and (B) incidental
          personal property necessary for the ownership or operation of the
          Properties.

     (ii) No Individual Borrower will engage in any business other than the
          ownership, management and operation of the Properties and will conduct
          and operate its business as presently conducted and operated.

     (iii) No Individual Borrower will enter into any contract or agreement with
          any of its Affiliates or constituent parties, any guarantor (a
          "Guarantor") of the Debt or any part thereof or any Affiliate of any
          constituent party or Guarantor, except upon terms and conditions that
          are intrinsically fair and substantially similar to those that would
          be available on an arms-length basis with third parties other than any
          such party.

     (iv) No Individual Borrower has incurred, and no Individual Borrower will
          incur, any indebtedness, secured or unsecured, direct or indirect,
          absolute or contingent (including guaranteeing any obligation), other
          than the Permitted Indebtedness. Except as set forth in the
          immediately preceding sentence, no indebtedness other than the Debt
          may be secured (subordinate or pari passu) by the Properties.

     (v)  No Individual Borrower has made and no Individual Borrower will make
          any loans or advances to any third party (including any affiliate or
          constituent party, any Guarantor or any affiliate of any constituent
          party or Guarantor).

     (vi) Each Individual Borrower is and will remain solvent and will pay its
          debts and liabilities (including employment and overhead expenses)
          from its assets as the same shall become due.

     (vii) Each Individual Borrower has done or caused to be done and will do
          all things necessary to observe corporate or partnership formalities,
          as the case may be, and preserve its existence.

     (viii) No Individual Borrower will, nor will any Individual Borrower,
          permit any constituent party or Guarantor to amend, modify or
          otherwise change the partnership certificate, partnership

                                       31

<PAGE>

          agreement, articles of incorporation and bylaws, trust or other
          organizational documents of an Individual Borrower or such constituent
          party or Guarantor in a manner which would adversely affect an
          Individual Borrower's existence as a single purpose entity.

     (ix) Each Individual Borrower will maintain books and records and bank
          accounts separate from those of its Affiliates and any constituent
          party and each Individual Borrower will file its own tax returns.

     (x)  Each Individual Borrower will be, and at all times will hold itself
          out to the public as, a legal entity separate and distinct from any
          other entity (including any affiliate, any constituent party, any
          Guarantor or any Affiliate of any constituent party or Guarantor),
          shall conduct business in its own name and shall maintain and utilize
          separate stationery, invoices and checks.

     (xi) Each Individual Borrower will maintain adequate capital for the normal
          obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and
          character and in light of its contemplated business operations.

     (xii) No Individual Borrower nor any constituent party will seek the
          dissolution or winding up, in whole or in part, of any Individual
          Borrower.

     (xiii) No Individual Borrower will commingle its funds and other assets
          with those of any Affiliate or constituent party, any Guarantor, or
          any Affiliate of any constituent party or Guarantor, or any other
          person.

     (xiv) Each Individual Borrower has and will maintain its assets in such a
          manner that it will not be costly or difficult to segregate, ascertain
          or identify its individual assets from those of any Affiliate or
          constituent party, any Guarantor, or any Affiliate of any constituent
          party or Guarantor, or any other person.

     (xv) No Individual Borrower does and no Individual Borrower will hold
          itself out to be responsible for the debts or obligations of any other
          person.

     (xvi) Each Individual Borrower has and will maintain financial statements
          separate from those of its affiliates and any constituent party.

     (xvii) Each Individual Borrower will pay the salaries of its own employees
          or will allocate fairly and reasonably the salaries of any shared
          employees.

     (xviii) No Individual Borrower has and no Individual Borrower will acquire
          the obligations or securities of any of its partners, shareholders or

                                       32

<PAGE>

     (xx) Except for the joint and several liability of all Individual Borrowers
          under the Loan, no Individual Borrower will pledge its assets for the
          benefit of any other entity or hold out its credit as being available
          to satisfy the obligations of others.

     (xxi) Each Individual Borrower will correct any known misunderstanding
          regarding its separate entity.

     (xxii) The General Partner will at all times comply with each of the
          representations, warranties, and covenants contained in this Section
          4.1 as if such representation, warranty or covenant was made directly
          by the General Partner.

     (xxiii) The charter of the General Partner shall at all times have at least
          one duly appointed member of its board of directors (an "Independent
          Director") reasonably satisfactory to Lender who shall not have been
          at the time of such individual's appointment, and may not have been at
          any time during the preceding two years (i) a shareholder of, or an
          officer or employee of, any Individual Borrower or any of its
          shareholders, subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) a customer of, or
          supplier to, any Individual Borrower or any of its shareholders,
          subsidiaries or affiliates, (iii) a person or other entity controlling
          any such shareholder, supplier or customer, or (iv) a member of the
          immediate family of any such shareholder, officer, employee, supplier
          or customer of any other director of the General Partner. As used in
          this Section 4.1(cc)(xvii), the term "control" means the possession,
          directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction
          of the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through
          ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

     (xxiv) The board of directors of the General Partner shall not take any
          action which, under the terms of any certificate of incorporation,
          by-laws or any voting trust agreement with respect to any common
          stock, requires the vote of the board of directors of the General
          Partner unless at the time of such action there shall be at least one
          member who is an Independent Director.

     (xxv) Each Individual Borrower shall conduct its business so that the
          assumptions made with respect to such Individual Borrower in that
          certain opinion letter dated as of the date hereof delivered by
          Borrower's counsel in connection with the Loan shall be true and
          correct in all respects.

          (dd) Investment Company Act. No Individual Borrower is (i) an
"investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company,"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; (ii) a
"holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company" or an
"affiliate" of either a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended; or (iii)
subject to any other federal or state law or regulation which purports to
restrict or regulate its ability to borrow money.

          (ee) Fraudulent Transfer. No Individual Borrower has entered into the
Loan or any Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
any creditor, and each

                                       33

<PAGE>

Individual Borrower has received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its
obligations under the Loan Documents. Giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents, the fair saleable value of Borrower's assets
exceeds and will, immediately following the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents, exceed Borrower's total liabilities, including subordinated,
unliquidated, disputed or contingent liabilities. The fair saleable value of
Borrower's assets is and will, immediately following the execution and delivery
of the Loan Documents, be greater than Borrower's probable liabilities,
including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities or its debts as such
debts become absolute and matured. Each Individual Borrower's assets do not and,
immediately following the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents will not,
constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or
as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to, and does not believe
that it will, incur debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and
other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking
into account the timing and amounts to be payable on or in respect of
obligations of Borrower).

          (ff) Partners. The sole general partner of each Individual Borrower is
the General Partner. The REIT is the owner of all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the General Partner, all of which capital stock has been
validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable. Such stock is owned by the REIT
free and clear of all mortgages, assignments, pledges and security interests and
free and clear of all warrants, options and rights to purchase. Borrower has no
obligation to any Person to purchase, repurchase or issue any ownership interest
in it.

          (gg) Management Agreements. Borrower has made available to Lender
correct and complete copies of the Management Agreements. As of the Closing
Date, the Management Agreements are unmodified and in full force and effect and
Summerfield Lessee is not, and, to Borrower's best knowledge, Manager is not, in
default under any of the Management Agreements.

          (hh) Operating Lease. Borrower has made available to Lender a correct
and complete copy of each Operating Lease. As of the Closing Date each Operating
Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect and Borrower is not, and, to
Borrower's knowledge, Lessee is not, in default under any Operating Lease.

          (ii) Franchise Agreements. Borrower has made available to Lender a
correct and complete copy of each Franchise Agreement and all amendments
thereto. As of the Closing Date, each Franchise Agreement has not been further
amended and is in full force and effect and Borrower is not, and, to Borrower's
knowledge, no franchisor is, in default under any such Franchise Agreement.

          (jj) Contracts. Schedule 2 sets forth a description of each contract
or other agreement and management agreement (including all amendments thereto)
to which the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof or Lessee is a party which is
material to the value, utility, operation or legality of any Property, other
than Franchise Agreements, Management Agreements, Leases and any such contract
or agreement which may be terminated on thirty days' or less notice and without
any material penalty. The information set forth in such Schedule is correct and
complete in all

                                       34

<PAGE>

material respects as of the date hereof. A correct and complete copy of each
contract or other agreement and management agreement (including all such
amendments) specified on Schedule 2 has been provided to the Lender and each
thereof is unmodified (except as set forth on Schedule 2) and in full force and
effect and no Individual Borrower nor, to Borrower's knowledge, any other party
to any thereof is in default thereunder.

          Section 4.2 Survival of Representations. Borrower agrees that all of
the representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in Section 4.1 and
elsewhere in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents shall survive for so
long as any amount remains owing to Lender under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents by Borrower. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents by Borrower
shall be deemed to have been relied upon by Lender notwithstanding any
investigation heretofore or hereafter made by Lender or on its behalf.

V. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

          Section 5.1 Borrower Covenants. From the date hereof and until payment
and performance in full of all obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents
or the earlier release of the Lien of the Mortgages (and all related
obligations) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, Borrower hereby covenants and agrees with Lender that:

          (a) Existence: Compliance with Legal Requirements: Insurance. Each
Individual Borrower shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights,
licenses, permits and franchises and comply with all Legal Requirements
applicable to it and each Property. Each Individual Borrower shall at all times
maintain, preserve and protect all franchises and trade names and preserve all
the remainder of its property used or useful in the conduct of its business and
shall keep or cause to be kept each Property in good working order and repair,
and from time to time make, or cause to be made, all reasonably necessary
repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereto, all as
more fully provided in the Mortgages. Borrower shall keep or cause to be kept
each Property insured at all times by financially sound and reputable insurers,
to such extent and against such risks, and maintain liability and such other
insurance, as is more fully provided in this Agreement.

          (b) Taxes and Other Charges. Borrower shall pay all Taxes and Other
Charges now or hereafter levied or assessed or imposed against each Property or
any part thereof before they become delinquent. Borrower will deliver to Lender
receipts for payment or other evidence satisfactory to Lender that the Taxes and
Other Charges have been so paid or are not then delinquent no later than thirty
(30) days prior to the date on which the Taxes and/or Other Charges would
otherwise be delinquent if not paid (provided, however, that Borrower is not
required to furnish such receipts for payment of Taxes in the event that such
Taxes have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof). Borrower shall
not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid and discharged any lien or charge
whatsoever which may be or become a lien or charge against any Property, and
shall promptly pay for all utility services provided to any Property. After
prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own expense, may contest by
appropriate legal proceeding, promptly

                                       35

<PAGE>

initiated and conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or
validity or application in whole or in part of any Taxes or Other Charges,
provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and remains
uncured, (ii) such proceeding shall suspend the collection of the Taxes or Other
Charges from the applicable Property, (iii) such proceeding shall be permitted
under and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any other instrument
to which an Individual Borrower is subject and shall not constitute a default
thereunder, (iv) neither such Property nor any part thereof or interest therein
will be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, canceled or lost, (v)
Borrower shall have furnished such security as may be required in the
proceeding, or as may be requested by Lender, to insure the payment of any such
Taxes or Other Charges, together with all interest and penalties thereon; and
(vi) Borrower shall promptly upon final determination thereof pay the amount of
any such Taxes or Other Charges, together with all costs, interest and
penalties which may be payable in connection therewith. Lender may pay over any
such cash deposit or part thereof held by Lender to the claimant entitled
thereto at any time when, in the reasonable judgment of Lender, the entitlement
of such claimant is established.

          (c) Litigation. Borrower shall give prompt written notice to Lender of
any litigation or governmental proceedings pending or threatened in writing
against any Individual Borrower which might materially adversely affect any
Individual Borrower's condition (financial or otherwise) or business or any
Property.

          (d) Premises. Borrower shall permit agents, representatives and
employees of Lender to inspect the Properties or any part thereof at reasonable
hours upon reasonable advance notice.

          (e) Notice of Default. Borrower shall promptly advise Lender of any
material adverse change in any Individual Borrower's condition, financial or
otherwise, or of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default of which
Borrower has knowledge.

          (f) Cooperate in Legal Proceedings. Borrower shall cooperate fully
with Lender with respect to any proceedings before any court, board or other
Governmental Authority which may in any way affect the rights of Lender
hereunder or any rights obtained by Lender under any of the other Loan Documents
and, in connection therewith, permit Lender, at its election, to participate in
any such proceedings.

          (g) Perform Loan Documents. Each Individual Borrower shall observe,
perform and satisfy all the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of, and
shall pay when due all costs, fees and expenses to the extent required under the
Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, such Individual
Borrower.

          (h) Insurance Benefits. Borrower shall cooperate with Lender in
obtaining for Lender the benefits of any Insurance Proceeds lawfully or
equitably payable in connection with any Property, and Lender shall be
reimbursed for any reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith
(including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and the reasonable expense of an
appraisal

                                       36

<PAGE>

on behalf of Lender in case of a fire or other casualty affecting any Property
or any part thereof) out of such Insurance Proceeds.

          (i) Further Assurances. Each Individual Borrower shall, at Borrower's
sole cost and expense:

               (A) furnish to Lender all instruments, documents, boundary
surveys, footing or foundation surveys, certificates, plans and specifications,
appraisals, title and other insurance reports and agreements, and each and every
other document, certificate, agreement and instrument required to be furnished
by it pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents or reasonably requested by
Lender in connection therewith;

               (B) execute and deliver to Lender such documents, instruments,
certificates, assignments and other writings, and do such other acts necessary
or desirable, to evidence, preserve and/or protect the collateral at any time
securing or intended to secure its obligations under the Loan Documents, all as
Lender may reasonably require; and

               (C) do and execute all and such further lawful and reasonable
acts, conveyances and assurances for the better and more effective carrying out
of the intents and purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as
Lender shall reasonably require from time to time.

          (j) Supplemental Mortgages Affidavits. As of the date hereof, Borrower
represents that it has paid all state, county and municipal recording and all
other taxes imposed upon the execution and recordation of the Mortgages. If at
any time Lender determines, based on applicable law, that Lender is not being
afforded the maximum amount of security available from any one or more of the
Properties as a direct or indirect result of applicable taxes not having been
paid with respect to any such Properties, Borrower agrees that Borrower will
execute, acknowledge and deliver to Lender, immediately upon Lender's request,
supplemental affidavits increasing the amount of the Debt attributable to any
such Property (as set forth on Schedule 1 annexed hereto) for which all
applicable taxes have been paid to an amount determined by Lender to be equal to
the lesser of (a) the greater of the fair market value of the applicable
Property (i) as of the date hereof and (ii) as of the date such supplemental
affidavits are to be delivered to Lender, and (b) the amount of the Debt
attributable to any such Property (as set forth on Schedule 1 annexed hereto),
and Borrower shall, on demand, pay any additional taxes.

          (k) Financial Reporting.

               (i) Borrower will keep and maintain or will cause to be kept and
maintained on a Fiscal Year basis, in accordance with GAAP, proper and accurate

and all items of income and expense in connection with the operation on an
individual basis of each of the Properties and in connection with any services,
equipment or furnishings provided in connection with the operation of each of
the Properties, whether such income or expense be realized by Borrower or by any

whatsoever, excepting lessees unrelated to and not an Affiliate of Borrower who
have leased from Borrower or Lessee portions of any of the Properties for the
purpose of occupying the same. Lender shall have the right from time to time at
all times during normal business hours upon reasonable notice to examine such
books, records and accounts at the office of Borrower or other Person
maintaining such books, records and accounts and to make such copies or extracts
thereof as Lender shall desire. After the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Borrower shall pay any costs and expenses incurred by Lender to examine
Borrower's accounting records with respect to the Properties, as Lender shall
determine to be necessary or appropriate in the protection of Lender's interest.

               (ii) Borrower will furnish to Lender annually, (A) within
forty-five (45) days following the end of each Fiscal Year of Borrower,
unaudited financial statements of Borrower, and (B) within ninety (90) days

annual financial statements, audited by a "big six" accounting firm or another
independent certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to Lender, in
accordance with GAAP, covering the Properties on a combined basis as well as
each individual Property for such Fiscal Year, and containing statements of
profit and loss for Borrower and the Properties in such detail as Lender may
request; provided, however, that separate financial statements for each
individual Property need not be audited so long as such statements are
accompanied by a report of such accountant, based upon procedures satisfactory
to Lender. Such statements shall set forth the income and expenses for the
Properties for the immediately preceding calendar year, including statements of
annual Actual Net Operating Income. Borrower's audited annual financial
statements shall be accompanied by an unqualified opinion of such accountant.
Borrower's annual financial statements (audited and unaudited) shall be
accompanied by an Officer's Certificate certifying that each such annual
financial statement presents fairly the financial condition of the Properties
being reported upon and has been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Together
with Borrower's annual financial statements, Borrower shall furnish to Lender an
Officer's Certificate certifying as of the date thereof whether there exists an
event or circumstance which constitutes a Default or Event of Default under the
Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower, and if
such Default or Event of Default exists, the nature thereof, the period of time
it has existed and the action then being taken to remedy the same.

               (iii) Borrower will furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Lender
on or before thirty-five (35) days after the end of each calendar month the
following items, accompanied by an Officer's Certificate certifying that such

condition and results of the operations of Borrower and the Properties in
accordance with GAAP (subject to normal year end adjustments) as applicable: (A)
monthly and year to date operating statements prepared for each calendar month
(on an aggregate and Property by Property basis), noting Actual Net Operating
Income and other information necessary and sufficient under GAAP to fairly
represent results of operation of the Properties during such calendar month, all
in form satisfactory to Lender; (B) a comparison of the budgeted income and
expenses and the actual income and expenses for each month and year to date for
the Properties on an aggregate basis together with a detailed explanation of any
variances of ten percent (10%) or more between budgeted and actual amounts for
such period and year to date; (C) a statement of the actual

                                       38

<PAGE>

capital expenditures made by Borrower during each calendar quarter as of the
last day of such calendar quarter; (D) a calculation reflecting the annual
Actual Debt Service Coverage Ratio as of the last day of each calendar month;
and (F) a statement that the representations and warranties of Borrower set
forth in Section 4.1(cc)(iv) are true and correct as of the date of such
certificate.

               (iv) Borrower will furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Lender
as soon as available and in any event on or before thirty-five (35) days after
the end of each calendar month occupancy rates, room rate statistics, and for
any Property which has Leases other than an Operating Lease, rent rolls
(identifying the leased premises, names of all tenants, units leased, monthly
rental and all other charges payable under each lease, date to which paid, term
of lease, date of occupancy, date of expiration, any and every material special
provision, concession or inducement granted to tenants) and a delinquency report
for the Properties, and such other relevant information with respect to the

operation of any of the Properties and the financial affairs of Borrower as may
be reasonably requested by Lender or any applicable Rating Agency.

          (l) Business and Operations. Each Individual Borrower will continue to
engage in the businesses presently conducted by it as and to the extent the same

Properties. Each Individual Borrower will qualify to do business and will remain
in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction as and to the extent the
same are required for the ownership, maintenance, management and operation of
the Properties.

          (m) Title to the Properties. Borrower will warrant and defend (i) the
title to each Property and every part thereof, subject only to Liens permitted
under the Loan Documents (including Permitted Encumbrances), and (ii) the
validity and priority of the Lien of each Mortgage, subject only to Liens
permitted under the Loan Documents (including Permitted Encumbrances), in each
case against the claims of all Persons whomsoever. Borrower shall reimburse
Lender for any losses, costs, damages or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by Lender if an interest in any
Property, other than as permitted hereunder, is claimed by another Person.

          (n) Costs of Enforcement. In the event (i) that any Mortgage is
foreclosed in whole or in part is put into the hands of an attorney for
collection, suit, action or foreclosure, (ii) of the foreclosure of any mortgage

proceeding Lender is made a party, or (iii) of the bankruptcy, insolvency,
rehabilitation or other similar proceeding in respect of any Individual Borrower
or an assignment by any Individual Borrower for the benefit of its creditors,
Borrower, its successors or assigns, shall be chargeable with and agrees to pay
all costs of collection and defense, including attorneys' fees in connection

                                       39

therewith and in connection with any appellate proceeding or post-judgment

binding obligations and have not been modified or if modified, giving
particulars of such modification.

               (ii) After request by Lender (but no more frequently than twice
in any year), Borrower shall within ten (10) days furnish Lender with a
certificate reaffirming all representations and warranties of Borrower set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents as of the date requested by Lender or, to
the extent of any changes to any such representations and warranties, so stating
such changes.

               (iii) Borrower shall deliver to Lender upon request, tenant
estoppel certificates from Lessee and each tenant of Borrower or Lessee at the

          (q) Performance by Borrower. Each Individual Borrower shall in a
timely manner observe, perform and fulfill each and every covenant, term and
provision of each Loan Document executed and delivered by, or applicable to,
such Individual Borrower, and shall not enter into or otherwise suffer or permit
any amendment, waiver, supplement, termination or other modification of any Loan
Document executed and delivered by, or applicable to, such Individual Borrower
without the prior written consent of Lender.

          (r) Annual Budget. Prior to the Optional Prepayment Date, Borrower
shall prepare and submit (or shall cause Lessee to prepare and submit) to Lender
by December 1 of each year during the Term, for approval by Lender, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, a proposed pro forma
budget for each Property during the succeeding fiscal year commencing January 1
and ending December 31 (the "Annual Budget") and, promptly after preparation
thereof, any subsequent revisions to such Annual Budget and the final Annual
Budget by January 31 of such year. After the Optional Prepayment Date, Borrower
shall prepare and submit such Annual Budget by November 15 of each remaining
year of the Term. Lender's failure to approve or disapprove any Annual Budget
within thirty (30) days after Lender's receipt thereof shall be deemed to
constitute Lender's approval thereof. The Annual Budget shall consist of (a) for
any Property for which there is no Operating Lease, an operating expense budget
(the "Operating

                                       40

<PAGE>

Budget") showing, on a month-by-month basis, in reasonable detail, each line

accrual basis), including amounts required to establish, maintain and/or
increase reserves for such Property, (b) for each Property a Capital Expense
budget (the "Capital Budget") showing, on a Property-by-Property basis, in

Borrower shall deliver, in connection with any Secondary Market Transaction, (i)
one or more Officer's Certificates certifying as to the accuracy of all
representations made by Borrower in the Loan Documents as of the date of the
closing of such Secondary Market Transaction in all relevant jurisdictions or,
to the extent of any changes to any such representations and warranties, so
stating such changes, and (ii) certificates of the relevant Governmental
Authorities in all relevant jurisdictions indicating the good standing and
qualification of Borrower as of the date of the Secondary Market Transaction.

          (t) No Joint Assessment. Borrower shall not suffer, permit or initiate
the joint assessment of any Property (i) with any other real property
constituting a tax lot separate from such Property, and (ii) with any portion of
such Property which may be deemed to constitute personal property, or any other
procedure whereby the lien of any taxes which may be levied against such
personal property shall be assessed or levied or charged to such Property.

          (u) Leasing Matters. No Individual Borrower shall, without Lender's
prior written consent, enter into, modify, amend or renew any Lease for space
over 1,500 square feet. Upon request, Borrower shall furnish Lender with
executed copies of all Leases. All renewals of Leases and all proposed Leases
shall provide for rental rates that are at or greater than existing local market
rates for space at hotel properties similar to the applicable Property. All
proposed Leases shall be on commercially reasonable terms and shall not contain
any terms which would materially adversely affect Lender's rights under the Loan
Documents. All Leases shall provide (either by the terms of the Lease or
pursuant to a subordination and non-disturbance agreement with Lender) that they
are subordinate to the Mortgage encumbering the applicable Property and that the
lessee agrees to attorn to Lender. Borrower (i) shall observe and perform or
cause to be performed the obligations imposed upon the lessor under the Leases;
(ii) shall enforce the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Leases
upon the part of the lessee thereunder to be observed or performed; (iii) shall
not collect any of the rents more than one (1) month in advance (other than
security deposits); (iv) shall not execute any other assignment of lessor's
interest in the Leases or the Rents (except as contemplated by the Loan
Documents); (v) shall not alter, modify or change the terms of the Leases in a
manner inconsistent within the provisions of the Loan Documents; and (vi) shall
execute and deliver at the request of Lender all such further assurances,
confirmations and assignments in connection with the Leases as Lender shall from
time to time reasonably require.

          (v) Operation of the Properties. Borrower shall (a) cause each of the
JF Properties to be leased to the JF Lessee pursuant to the JF Operating Leases
and (b) cause the

                                       41

<PAGE>

Summerfield Properties to be leased to Summerfield Lessee pursuant to the
Summerfield Operating Leases and managed by Summerfield Lessee or by Manager
pursuant to the Management Agreements (or such other third-party managers
approved by Lender pursuant to management agreements approved as to form and
substance by and in all respects acceptable to Lender). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that (A) there shall have occurred and be continuing an
Event of Default or (B) on the last day of any calendar quarter, the Debt
Service Coverage Ratio (using Actual Net Operating Income) is less than 1.40 to
1.00, then, except as hereinafter provided, Lender may instruct Borrower to (i)
terminate the JF Operating Leases with respect to any or all of the JF
Properties and/or (ii) except as otherwise provided in the Summerfield
Subordinations, terminate the Summerfield Operating Leases and/or cause
Summerfield Lessee to terminate the Management Agreements with respect to any or
all of the Summerfield Properties, and/or (iii) may designate either a
replacement lessee or a hotel manager, as the case may be, acceptable to Lender
and willing to operate the applicable Properties pursuant to terms and
conditions and pursuant to operating leases or management agreements approved by
Lender, and, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, Borrower shall so
terminate the applicable Operating Leases and/or cause Summerfield Lessee to
terminate the Management Agreements and appoint or cause the appointment of such
replacement lessee or manager. No Individual Borrower shall (and no Individual
Borrower shall permit Lessee to) enter into any operating lease or property
management agreement in respect of any Property without Lender's prior written
consent and unless any such agreement contains a provision permitting such
agreement to be terminated as contemplated above and unless such replacement
operator or manager executes an agreement substantially similar (and otherwise
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender) to the Lessee Subordination.
Lender shall not have the right to require the termination of any Operating
Lease or any Management Agreement under the circumstances described in the
foregoing clause (B) if (x) no Event of Default shall have occurred or be
continuing and (y) within ten Business Days after the end of the calendar
quarter for which such circumstances have arisen, Borrower shall defease a
portion of the Loan in accordance with Section 2.3.3 sufficient to produce a
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (using Actual Net Operating Income) on the
undefeased portion of the Loan equal to at least 1.40 to 1.00.

          (w) Principal Place of Business. Borrower shall not change its
principal place of business set forth on the first page of this Agreement
without first giving Lender thirty (30) days prior written notice.

operated pursuant to the Franchise Agreements. Borrower shall:

               (i) promptly perform and/or observe (or cause to be performed
and/or observed) all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
and observed by it under the Franchise Agreements and do all things necessary to
preserve and to keep unimpaired its material rights thereunder;

               (ii) promptly notify Lender of any default under the any
Franchise Agreement of which it is aware;

                                       42

               (iii) promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each financial
statement, business plan, capital expenditures plan, property improvement plan
and any other notice, report and estimate received by it under any of the
Franchise Agreements; and

               (iv) promptly enforce or cause to be enforced the performance and
observance of all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed

          (y) Management Agreements. With respect to the Summerfield Properties,
Borrower shall:

               (i) promptly perform and/or observe (or cause to be performed
and/or observed) all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
and observed by it under the Management Agreements and do all things necessary
to preserve and to keep unimpaired its material rights thereunder;

               (ii) promptly notify Lender of any default under the any
Management Agreement of which it is aware;

               (iii) promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each financial
statement, business plan, capital expenditures plan, property improvement plan
and any other notice, report and estimate received by it under any of the

               (iv) promptly enforce or cause to be enforced the performance and
observance of all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
and/or observed by the Manager under each Management Agreement.

any Property (except pursuant to Section 5.1(v)), (ii) reduce or consent to the
reduction of the term of the Operating Lease or any of the Management Agreements
or Franchise Agreements; (iii) increase or consent to the increase by any
material amount of the amount of any charges under any of the Management
Agreements or Franchise Agreements; or (iv) otherwise modify, change,
supplement, alter or amend, or waive or release any of its rights and

remedies under the Operating Leases or any of the Management Agreements or
Franchise Agreements in any material respect.

          (b) Liens. No Individual Borrower shall, without the prior written
consent of Lender, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any
portion of any of the Properties or permit any such action to be taken, except
(i) Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) Liens created by or permitted pursuant to the
Loan Documents and (iii) Liens for Taxes or Other Charges not yet delinquent,
unless any such Lien is bonded or discharged within thirty (30) days after

otherwise forgive or release any claim or debt owed to such Individual Borrower
by any Person, except for adequate consideration and in the ordinary course of
such Individual Borrower's business in its reasonable judgment.

          (f) Affiliate Transactions. No Individual Borrower shall enter into,
or be a party to, any transaction with an Affiliate of such Individual Borrower
or any of the partners of such Individual Borrower except in the ordinary course
of business and on terms which are fully disclosed to Lender in advance and are
no less favorable to such Individual Borrower or such Affiliate than would be
obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction with an unrelated third party.

          (g) Zoning. No Individual Borrower shall initiate or consent to any
zoning reclassification of any portion of any of any Property or seek any
variance under any existing zoning ordinance or use or permit the use of any

any Individual Borrower, or which result in any limited partner (other than a
limited partner currently owning more than a 49% interest) owning more than 49%
of the interests (direct or indirect) in any Individual Borrower, shall require
(1) written confirmation from the applicable Rating Agencies that such Transfers
will not cause a qualification, withdrawal or downgrading of the ratings in
effect immediately prior to such Transfer for the Securities issued in

Payable Endorsement, or their equivalents, naming Lender as the person to which
all payments made by such insurance company shall be paid; (iv) shall contain a
waiver of subrogation against Lender; (v) shall be maintained throughout the
Term without cost to Lender; (vi) shall be assigned and the originals thereof
delivered to Lender; (vii) shall contain such provisions as Lender deems
reasonably necessary or desirable to protect its interest including endorsements
providing that neither Borrower, Lender nor any other party shall be a
co-insurer under said Policies and that Lender shall receive at least thirty
(30) days prior written notice of any modification, reduction or cancellation of
any of the Policies; and (viii) shall be satisfactory in form and substance to
Lender and shall be approved by Lender as to amounts, form, risk coverage,
deductibles, loss payees and insureds. Borrower shall pay the premiums for such
Policies (the "Insurance Premiums") as the same become due and payable and shall
furnish to Lender evidence of the renewal of each of the Policies with receipts
for the payment of the Insurance Premiums or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to Lender (provided, however, that Borrower is not
required to furnish such evidence of payment to Lender if such Insurance
Premiums have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof). If Borrower
does not furnish such evidence and receipts at least thirty (30) days prior to
the expiration of any expiring Policy, then Lender may procure, but shall not be
obligated to procure, such insurance and pay the Insurance Premiums therefor,
and Borrower agrees to reimburse Lender for the cost of such Insurance Premiums
promptly on demand. Within thirty (30) days after request by Lender, Borrower
shall obtain such increases in the amounts of coverage required hereunder as may
be reasonably requested by Lender, taking into consideration changes in the
value of money over time, changes in liability laws, changes in prudent customs
and practices, and the like.

          (d) If any Property is damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by
fire or other casualty (an "Insured Casualty"), Borrower shall give prompt
notice thereof to Lender. Following the occurrence of an Insured Casualty,
Borrower, regardless of whether insurance proceeds are available, shall promptly
proceed to restore, repair, replace or rebuild the affected Property to be of at
least equal value and of substantially the same character as prior to such
damage or destruction, all to be effected in accordance with Legal Requirements.
The expenses incurred by Lender in the adjustment and collection of insurance
proceeds shall become part of the Debt and be secured hereby and shall be
reimbursed by Borrower to Lender upon demand.

          7.1.2 Casualty and Application of Proceeds. (a) In case of loss or
damages covered by any of the Policies, the following provisions shall apply:

               (i) In the event of an Insured Casualty that does not exceed
$250,000, Borrower may settle and adjust any claim without the consent of
Lender; provided that such adjustment is carried out in a competent and timely
manner. In such case, Borrower is hereby authorized to collect and receipt for
any such insurance proceeds.

               (ii) In the event of an Insured Casualty that equals or exceeds
$250,000, Lender may settle and adjust any claim without the consent of Borrower
and agree with the insurance company or companies on the amount to be paid on
the loss and the proceeds of any such policy shall be due and payable solely to
Lender and held in escrow by Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.

                                       47

<PAGE>

          (b) In the event of an Insured Casualty where the loss is in an
aggregate amount less than sixty percent (60%) of the Allocated Loan Amount for
any individual Property, and if, in the reasonable judgment of Lender, the
Property can be restored within six (6) months and prior to the maturity of the
Note (and prior to the, expiration of the business interruption insurance) to an
economic unit not materially less valuable and not less useful than the same was
prior to the Insured Casualty, and after such restoration will adequately secure
the outstanding balance of the Allocated Loan Amount, then, if no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be then continuing, the proceeds of
insurance (after reimbursement of any expenses incurred by Lender) shall be
applied to reimburse Borrower for the cost of restoring, repairing, replacing or
rebuilding the Property or part thereof subject to the Insured Casualty (the
"Restoration"), in the manner set forth herein. Borrower hereby covenants and
agrees to commence and diligently to prosecute such Restoration; provided that
(i) Borrower shall pay all costs (and if required by Lender, Borrower shall
deposit the total thereof with Lender in advance) of such Restoration in excess
of the net proceeds of insurance made available pursuant to the terms hereof;
(ii) the Restoration shall be done in compliance with all Legal Requirements;
and (iii) Lender shall have received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
that, during the period of the Restoration, the sum of (A) income derived from
the applicable Property, as reasonably determined by Lender, plus (B) proceeds
of rent loss insurance or business interruption insurance, if any, to be paid,
plus (C) any amounts otherwise deposited by Borrower with Lender, will equal or
exceed the sum of (I) expenses in connection with the operation of such Property
and (II) the debt service under the portion of the Loan attributable to such
Property.

          (c) Except as provided above, the proceeds of insurance collected upon
any Insured Casualty may, at the option of Lender in its sole discretion, be
applied to the payment of the Debt (up to the Release Amount for the Property so
affected together with any Yield Maintenance Premium applicable thereto to the
extent provided under Section 2.3.3) or applied to reimburse Borrower for the
cost of any Restoration, in the manner set forth below. Any such application to
the Debt shall be without any prepayment consideration except that if an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time the insurance proceeds are
received from the insurance company, then Borrower shall pay to Lender an
additional amount equal to the Yield Maintenance Premium, if any, that would be
required under Section 2.3.3 hereof if a Defeasance Deposit was to be made by
Borrower in the case of a Defeased Note equal to the amount of the insurance
proceeds applied to the Debt. After any such application to the Debt, the
remaining principal balance outstanding under the Note shall be reamortized over
the remaining term thereof, and the Allocated Loan Amount for the affected
Property shall be reduced by the principal reduction resulting from such
application.

          (d) If Borrower is entitled to reimbursement out of insurance proceeds
held by Lender, such proceeds shall be deposited by Lender into the
Casualty/Condemnation Subaccount and disbursed from time to time from the
Casualty/Condemnation Subaccount upon Lender being furnished with (1) evidence
satisfactory to it of the estimated cost of completion of the Restoration, (2)
funds or, at Lender's option, assurances satisfactory to Lender that such funds
are available, sufficient in addition to the proceeds of insurance to complete
the proposed Restoration, (3) such architect's certificates, waivers of lien,
contractor's sworn statements, title insurance endorsements, bonds, plats of
survey and such other evidences of cost, payment and performance as Lender may
reasonably require and approve, and (4) all plans and specifications for such
Restoration, such plans

                                       48

<PAGE>

and specifications to be approved by Lender prior to commencement of any work.
In addition, no payment made prior to the final completion of the Restoration
shall exceed ninety percent (90%) of the value of the work performed from time
to time; funds other than proceeds of insurance shall be disbursed prior to
disbursement of such proceeds; and at all times, the undisbursed balance of such
proceeds remaining in the hands of Lender, together with funds deposited for
that purpose or irrevocably committed to the satisfaction of Lender by or on
behalf of Borrower for that purpose, shall be at least sufficient in the
reasonable judgment of Lender to pay for the cost of completion of the
Restoration, free and clear of all liens or claims for lien. Any surplus which
may remain out of insurance proceeds held by Lender after payment of such costs
of Restoration shall be paid to Borrower.

          7.13 Condemnation. (a) Borrower shall promptly give Lender written
notice of the actual or threatened commencement of any condemnation or eminent
domain proceeding affecting a Property (a "Condemnation") and shall deliver to
Lender copies of any and all papers served in connection with such Condemnation.
Following the occurrence of a Condemnation, Borrower, regardless of whether an
Award is available, shall promptly proceed to restore, repair, replace or
rebuild the affected Property to the extent practicable to be of at least equal
value and of substantially the same character as prior to such Condemnation, all
to be effected in accordance with Legal Requirements.

          (b) Lender is hereby irrevocably appointed as Borrower's
attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, with exclusive power to collect,
receive and retain any award or payment in respect of a Condemnation (an
"Award") and to make any compromise or settlement in connection with such
Condemnation, subject to the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding any
Condemnation by any public or quasi-public authority (including any transfer
made in lieu of or in anticipation of such a Condemnation), Borrower shall
continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided for in the Note,
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the Debt shall not be reduced
unless and until any Award shall have been actually received and applied by
Lender to expenses of collecting the Award and to discharge of the Debt (up to
the Release Amount for the Property so affected together with any Yield
Maintenance Premium applicable thereto to the extent provided under Section
2.3.3). Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the
condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award interest
at the rate or rates provided in the Note. Borrower shall cause any Award that
is payable to Borrower to be paid directly to Lender.

          (c) In the event of any Condemnation where the Award is in an
aggregate amount less than sixty (60%) of the Allocated Loan Amount for any
Property, and if, in the reasonable judgment of Lender, the Property can be
restored within six (6) months and prior to maturity of the Note (and prior to
expiration of the business interruption insurance) to an economic unit not less
valuable and not less useful than the same was prior to the Condemnation, and
after such restoration will adequately secure the outstanding balance of the
Allocated Loan Amount, then, if no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be then continuing, the proceeds of the Award (after reimbursement
of any expenses incurred by Lender) shall be applied to reimburse Borrower for
the cost of restoring, repairing, replacing or rebuilding the Property or part
thereof subject to

                                       49

<PAGE>

Condemnation (the "Condemnation Restoration") in the manner set forth below.
Borrower hereby covenants and agrees to commence and diligently to prosecute
such Condemnation Restoration; provided that (i) Borrower shall pay all costs
(and if required by Lender, Borrower shall deposit the total thereof with Lender
in advance) of such Condemnation Restoration in excess of the Award made
available pursuant to the terms hereof; (ii) the Condemnation Restoration shall
be done in compliance with all Legal Requirements; and (iii) Lender shall have
received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that, during the period of the
Condemnation Restoration, the sum of (A) income derived from the applicable
Property, as reasonably determined by Lender, plus (B) proceeds of rent loss
insurance or business interruption insurance, if any, to be paid, plus (C) any
amounts otherwise deposited by Borrower with Lender, will equal or exceed the
sum of (I) expenses in connection with the operation of such Property and (II)
the debt service under the portion of the Loan attributable to such Property.

          (d) Except as provided above, the Award collected upon any
Condemnation shall, at the option of Lender in its sole discretion, be applied
to the payment of the Debt (up to the Release Amount for the Property so
affected together with any Yield Maintenance Premium applicable thereto to the
extent provided under Section 2.3.3) or applied to reimburse Borrower for the
cost of the Condemnation Restoration in the manner set forth below. Any such
application to the Debt shall be without any prepayment consideration except
that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time the Award
is received, then Borrower shall pay to Lender an additional amount equal to the
Yield Maintenance Premium, if any, that would be required under Section 2.3.3
hereof if a Defeasance Deposit was to be made by Borrower in the case of a
Defeased Note equal to the amount of the condemnation proceeds applied to the
Debt. After any such application to the Debt, the remaining principal balance
outstanding under the Note shall be reamortized over the remaining term thereof.
If the related Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the
receipt by Lender of such Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a
deficiency judgment on the Note shall be recoverable or shall have been sought,
recovered or denied, to receive all or a portion of said Award sufficient to pay
the Allocated Loan Amount and interest thereon.

          (e) In the event Borrower is entitled to reimbursement out of the
Award received by Lender, such proceeds shall be disbursed from time to time
upon Lender being furnished with (1) evidence satisfactory to it of the
estimated cost of completion of the Condemnation Restoration, (2) funds or, at
Lender's option, assurances satisfactory to Lender that such funds are
available, sufficient in addition to the proceeds of the Award to complete the
Condemnation Restoration, (3) such architect's certificates, waivers of lien,
contractor's sworn statements, title insurance endorsements, bonds, plats of
survey and such other evidences of costs, payment and performance as Lender may
reasonably require and approve; and (4) all plans and specifications for such
Condemnation Restoration, such plans and specifications to be approved by Lender
prior to commencement of work. In addition, no payment made prior to the final
completion of the restoration, repair, replacement and rebuilding shall exceed
ninety percent (90%) of the value of the work performed from time to time; (5)
funds other than proceeds of the Award shall be disbursed prior to disbursement
of such proceeds; and (6) at all times, the undisbursed balance of such proceeds
remaining in the hands of Lender, together with funds deposited for that purpose
or irrevocably committed to the satisfaction of Lender by or on behalf of
Borrower for that purpose,

                                       50

<PAGE>

shall be at least sufficient in the reasonable judgment of Lender to pay for the
costs of completion of the Condemnation Restoration free and clear of all liens
or claims for lien. Any surplus which may remain out of the Award received by
Lender after payment of such costs of restoration, repair, replacement or
rebuilding shall, in the sole and absolute discretion of Lender, be retained by
Lender and applied to payment of the Debt or returned to Borrower.

          Section 7.2 Required Repair; Required Repair Funds.

          7.2.1 Required Repairs: Deposits. Borrower shall perform the deferred
maintenance and PIP work required under the Franchise Agreements at the
Properties set forth on Schedule 4 annexed hereto (the "Required Repairs").
Borrower shall complete each of the Required Repairs on or before the deadline
for same set forth on Schedule 4. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall deposit
with Lender the amount for each Property set forth on such Schedule 4 hereto to
perform the Required Repairs for such Property. Amounts so deposited with Lender
(the "Required Repair Fund") shall be held by Lender in an account (the
"Required Repair Account") in Lender's name at a financial institution selected
by Lender in its sole discretion and shall be invested in Permitted Investments.

          7.2.2 Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and
grants a security interest to Lender, as security for payment of all sums due in
respect of the Loan and the performance of all other terms, conditions and
covenants of the Loan Documents and this Agreement on Borrower's part to be paid
and performed, all of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the
Required Repair Fund and the Required Repair Account. Borrower shall not,
without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or
grant any security interest in the Required Repair Fund or the Required Repair
Account or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be
made thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as
the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

          7.2.3 Release of Required Repair Funds. Lender shall disburse to
Borrower all Required Repair Funds in the Required Repair Account with respect
to any individual Property upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the
following conditions: (a) Borrower shall submit a written request for payment to
Lender at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date on which Borrower
requests such payment be made (except in the case of an emergency repair which
requires immediate attention, in which event Borrower may submit such payment
request within ten (10) days), (b) on the date such request is received by
Lender and on the date such payment is to be made, no Default or Event of
Default shall exist and remain uncured, (c) Lender shall have received an
Officer's Certificate from Borrower certifying that all Required Repairs at the
applicable Property have been completed (i) in a good and workmanlike manner,
and (ii) in accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements, such certificate
to be accompanied by a copy of each license, permit or other approval required
by any Governmental Authority for the use or occupancy of the applicable
Property, (d) Lender shall have received an Officer's Certificate from Borrower
(i) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in connection with
the Required Repairs performed at such Property and (ii) stating that each such
Person has been or, upon receipt of the requested disbursement, will be paid in
full, such certificate to be accompanied by a copy of appropriate lien

                                       51

<PAGE>

waivers or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender, (e) at Lender's
option, a title search for such Property indicating that such Property is free
from all liens, claims and other encumbrances not previously approved by Lender,
and (f) Lender shall have received such other evidence as Lender shall
reasonably request that the Required Repairs at such Property have been
completed and paid for. Lender shall be required to make only one disbursement
per month from the Required Repair Account with respect to each Property and
such disbursement shall be made only upon satisfaction of each condition
contained in this Section 7.2.3. Upon completion of all Required Repairs in
accordance with the terms hereof, Lender shall disburse to Borrower any amounts
then remaining in the Required Repair Account.

          7.2.4 Failure to Perform Required Repairs. It shall be a Default under
this Agreement if (a) Borrower does not complete the Required Repairs at each
Property by the required deadline for each repair as set forth on Schedule 4, or
(b) Borrower does not satisfy each condition contained in Section 7.2.3 hereof.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender,
at its option, may withdraw all Required Repair Funds from the Required Repair
Account and Lender may apply such funds either to completion of the Required
Repairs at one or more of the Properties or toward payment of the Debt in such
order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole discretion.
Lender's right to withdraw and apply Required Repair Funds shall be in addition
to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

          Section 7.3 Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund.

          7.3.1 Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Borrower shall pay to Lender on
each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender estimates will be
payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate with
Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to
the respective dates they become delinquent, and (b) one-twelfth of the
Insurance Premiums that Lender reasonably estimates will be payable for the
renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in
order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance
Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said
amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund"). The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and the payments of interest or
principal or both, payable pursuant to the Note, shall be added together and
shall be paid as an aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender. Lender will apply the
Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums
required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof and under the
Mortgages, or to reimburse Borrower for such amounts upon presentation of
evidence of payment and an Officer's Certificate in form and substance
satisfactory to Lender; subject, however, to Borrower's right to contest Taxes
in accordance with Section 5.1(b) hereof. In making any payment relating to the
Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement
or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes)
or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into
the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any
tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. Borrower
shall furnish to Lender all bills and statements of the applicable taxing
authority with respect to Taxes no later than five (5) Business Days before the
same becomes

                                       52

<PAGE>

due and payable. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed
the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof,
Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit
such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund. In allocating such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on the
records of Lender to be the owner of the Properties. If at any time Lender
determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be
sufficient to pay the items set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify
Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payments
to Lender by the amount that Lender estimates is sufficient to make up the
deficiency at least thirty (30) days prior to delinquency of the Taxes and/or
expiration of the Policies, as the case may be.

          7.3.2 Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and
grants a security interest to Lender, as security for payment of all sums due
under the Loan and the performance of all other terms, conditions and provisions
of the Loan Documents and this Agreement on Borrower's part to be paid and
performed, of all Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund. Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the
Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach
thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements,
except those naming Leader as the secured party, to be filed with respect
thereto.

          7.3.3 Application of Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may apply
any sums then present in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to the payment of the
following items in any order in its sole discretion: (a) Taxes and Other
Charges; (b) Insurance Premiums; (c) interest on the unpaid principal balance of
the Note; (d) amortization of the unpaid principal balance of the Note; or (e)
all other sums payable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall not constitute a trust fund and may be
commingled with other monies held by Lender. Sums in the Tax and Insurance
Escrow Fund shall be held by Lender in an account in Lender's name at a
financial institution selected by Lender in its sole discretion and shall be
invested in Permitted Investments. Earnings or interest, if any, thereon shall
be retained as part of such funds and applied in accordance with this Section
7.3. Lender shall not be liable for any loss sustained on the investment of any
funds constituting the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund.

          Section 7.4 Capital Reserve Fund.

          7.4.1 Capital Reserve Fund. Borrower shall pay to Lender on each
Payment Date an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the gross revenues of the
Properties for the second calendar month preceding such Payment Date (said
amounts hereinafter called the "Capital Reserve Fund"). Lender will apply the
Capital Reserve Fund to payment of Approved Capital Expenses pursuant to the
terms hereof; provided, however, if the Loan shall have been accelerated or if
there is an Event of Default which is continuing, then Lender may credit such
Capital Reserve Fund against the Debt in such priority and proportions as
Lender in its sole and absolute discretion shall deem proper. If the amount of
the Capital Reserve Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Approved Capital

                                       53

<PAGE>

Expenses pursuant to the terms hereof, Lender shall, in its discretion, return
any excess to Borrower or, if future Capital Reserve Fund payments are then
required, credit such excess against such future payments; provided, however, if
the Loan shall have been accelerated or if there is an Event of Default which is
continuing, then Lender may credit such excess against the Debt in such priority
and proportions as Lender in its sole and absolute discretion shall deem proper.

          7.4.2 Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and
grants a security interest to Lender, as security for payment of all sums due
under the Loan and the performance of all other terms, conditions and provisions
of the Loan Documents and this Agreement on Borrower's part to be paid and
performed, of all Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the Capital
Reserve Fund, the Additional Capital Reserve Fund and any letter of credit
deposited by Borrower in lieu of a cash deposit for the Additional Capital
Reserve Fund. Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the Capital
Reserve Fund, the Additional Capital Reserve Fund or any such letter of credit,
or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made
thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the
secured party, to be filed with respect thereto. This Agreement is, among other
things, intended by the parties to be a security agreement for purposes of the
New York Uniform Commercial Code.

          7.4.3 Application of Capital Reserve Fund. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, Lender may apply any sums then present in the Capital Reserve
Fund and/or the Additional Capital Reserve Fund (and, if applicable, draw down
any letter of credit being held in connection therewith for application
hereunder) to the payment of the following items in any order in its sole
discretion: (a) Capital Expenses; (b) interest on the unpaid principal balance
of the Note; (c) amortization of the unpaid principal balance of the Note; or
(d) all other sums payable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. The Capital Reserve Fund and the Additional Capital Reserve Fund
shall not constitute a trust fund and may be commingled with other monies held
by Lender. Sums in the Capital Reserve Fund and the Additional Capital Reserve
Fund shall be held by Lender in an account in Lender's name at a financial
institution selected by Lender in its sole discretion and shall be invested in
Permitted Investments. Earnings or interest, if any, thereon shall become part
of the Capital Reserve Fund or the Additional Capital Reserve Fund and shall be
disbursed as provided in this Section 7.4.4. Lender shall not be liable for any
loss sustained on the investment of any funds constituting the Capital Reserve
Fund or the Additional Capital Reserve Fund.

          7.4.4 Payment of Capital Expenses. Funds held in the Capital Reserve
Fund may be used for Approved Capital Expenses. From time to time, Borrower may
send a request for disbursement of funds in the Capital Reserve Fund, but not
more than two (2) times per month and, to the extent there are sufficient funds
available in the Capital Reserve Fund, such disbursements shall be made by
Lender so long as (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(B) such expenditure is for an Approved Capital Expense; and (C) the request for
disbursement is accompanied by (1) an Officer's Certificate certifying (v) the
amount of funds to be disbursed, (w) that such funds will be used to pay
Approved Capital Expenses and a description thereof, (x) that all outstanding
trade payables (other than those to be paid from the requested disbursement or
those

                                       54

<PAGE>

otherwise permitted to be outstanding under Section 6.1(i) hereof) have been
paid in full, (y) that the same has not been the subject of a previous
disbursement, and (z) that all previous disbursements have been used to pay the
previously identified Approved Capital Expenses, (2) at Lender's option, copies
of appropriate lien waivers or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender,
and (3) reasonably detailed documentation as to the amount, necessity and
purpose therefor.

          Section 7.5 Payment of Approved Operating Expenses. Funds held in the
Deposit Account with respect to any Property for which there is no Operating
Lease may be used for Approved Operating Expenses. From time to time, Borrower
may send a request for disbursement of funds in the Deposit Account for payment
of Approved Operating Expenses, but not more than two (2) times per month. To
the extent there are funds available in the Deposit Account in excess of the
amounts required to fund the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, the Capital Reserve
Fund and to pay the Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount due in respect of the
Loan on the next Payment Date, such disbursements for Approved Operating
Expenses shall be made by the Lender so long as (A) no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing; (B) such expenditure is for an Approved
Operating Expense; and (C) the request for disbursement is accompanied by (1) an
Officer's Certificate certifying (v) the amount of funds to be disbursed, (w)
that such funds will be used to pay Approved Operating Expenses and a
description thereof, (x) that all outstanding trade payables (other than those
to be paid from the requested disbursement or those otherwise permitted to be
outstanding under Section 6.1(i) hereof) have been paid in full, (y) that the
same has not been the subject of a previous disbursement, and (z) that all
previous disbursements have been or will be used to pay the previously
identified Approved Operating Expenses, and (2) reasonably detailed
documentation as to the amount, necessity and purpose therefor. Subject to
satisfaction of the preceding conditions, if the Lender receives from the
Borrower a valid request for a disbursement for payment of Approved Operating
Expenses with respect to any Property for which there is no Operating Lease for
the then Current Month at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Payment Date
occurring in such Current Month, then the disbursement in respect of such
Approved Operating Expenses shall be made to Borrower on such Payment Date. If
the Borrower shall fail to validly request a disbursement for payment of
Approved Operating Expenses for such Property for the then Current Month at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Payment Date in such Current Month,
then the Lender shall retain in the Deposit Account an amount equal to the
anticipated Operating Expenses for the then Current Month as set forth in the
approved Operating Budget for such Property for such month, and the Lender
shall, subject to satisfaction of the preceding conditions, disburse same to the
Borrower five (5) Business Days after the Lender receives a valid request
therefor. Amounts disbursed to the Borrower under this Section 7.5 shall be used
by the Borrower to pay current Approved Operating Expenses for any Property for
which there is no Operating Lease and for no other purpose. The Borrower shall
furnish the Lender with copies of bills, statements, invoices, receipts or other
evidence as the Lender may reasonably request in connection with a request for
disbursement.

          (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default (other than an Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or
(viii) above) and at any time thereafter Lender may, in addition to any other
rights or remedies available to it pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or at law or in equity, Lender may take such action, without notice or
demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its rights against
Borrower and in and to the Properties, including declaring the Debt to be
immediately due and payable, and Lender may enforce or avail itself of any or
all rights or remedies provided in the Loan Documents against any or all of the
Individual Borrowers and any or all of the Properties, including all rights or
remedies available at law or in equity; and upon any Event of Default described
in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above, the Debt and all other obligations of
Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately and
automatically become due and payable, without notice or demand, and each
Individual Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything
contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

          Section 8.2 Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights,
powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Borrower under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or
applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any
time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be
declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any
foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and
remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to all or any of the
Properties. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent
and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise,
at such time and in

                                       58

<PAGE>

such order as Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and
remedies of Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein
or in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) to the
extent permitted by applicable law, Lender is not subject to any "one action" or
"election of remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights,
remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect
until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the Properties and each
Mortgage has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

          (b) With respect to Borrower and the Properties, and to the extent
permitted by applicable law, nothing contained herein or in any other Loan
Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to resort to any Individual
Borrower or any Property for the satisfaction of any of the Debt in preference
or priority to any Individual Borrower or any other Properties, and Lender may
seek satisfaction out of all of the Properties or any part thereof, in its
absolute discretion in respect of the Debt. In addition, Lender shall have the
right from time to time to partially foreclose the Mortgages in any manner and
for any amounts secured by the Mortgages then due and payable as determined by
Lender in its sole discretion including, without limitation, the following
circumstances: (i) in the event Borrower defaults in the payment of one or more
scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose one or more
of the Mortgages to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event
Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance
of the Loan, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages to recover so
much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such
other sums secured by one or more of the Mortgages as Lender may elect.
Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Properties shall remain
subject to the Mortgages to secure payment of sums secured by the Mortgages and
not previously recovered.

          (c) Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note
and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and
other security documents in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its
sole discretion for purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies
provided hereunder. Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to
time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other
documents as Lender shall request in order to effect the severance described in
the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true
and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to make and
execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance,
Borrower ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof.

          Section 8.3 Remedies Cumulative. The rights, powers and remedies of
Lender under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other
right, power or remedy which Lender may have against Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. Lender's rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singly,
concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may
determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any
remedy, right or power accruing upon

                                       59

<PAGE>

an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be
construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be
exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of
one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed
to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to
impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

IX. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

          Section 9.1 Sale of Note and Securitization. At the request of the
holder of the Note and, to the extent not already required to be provided by
Borrower under this Agreement, Borrower shall use reasonable efforts to satisfy
the market standards to which the holder of the Note customarily adheres or
which may be reasonably required in the marketplace or by the Rating Agencies in
connection with the sale of the Note or participation therein or the first
successful securitization (such sale and/or securitization, the
"Securitization") of rated single or multi-class securities (the "Securities")
secured by or evidencing ownership interests in the Note and the Mortgages,
including:

          (a) (i) provide such financial and other information with respect to
the Properties, Borrower and its affiliates, Manager and any tenants of the
Properties, (ii) provide business plans and budgets relating to the Properties
and (iii) to perform or permit or cause to be performed or permitted such site
inspection, appraisals, market studies, environmental reviews and reports (Phase
I's and, if appropriate, Phase II's), engineering reports and other due
diligence investigations of the Properties, as may be reasonably requested by
the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or as may be reasonably necessary
or appropriate in connection with the Securitization (the "Provided
Information"), together, if customary, with appropriate verification and/or
consents of the Provided Information through letters of auditors or opinions of
counsel of independent attorneys acceptable to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

          (b) at Borrower's expense, cause counsel to render opinions as to
non-consolidation, fraudulent conveyance, and true sale, true contribution or
any other opinion customary in securitization transactions with respect to the
Properties and Borrower and its affiliates, which counsel and opinions shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the holder of the Note and the Rating Agencies;

          (c) make such representations and warranties as of the closing date of
the Securitization with respect to the Properties, Borrower, and the Loan
Documents as are customarily provided in securitization transactions and as may
be reasonably requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies and
consistent with the facts covered by such representations and warranties as they
exist on the date thereof, including the representations and warranties made in
the Loan Documents; and

          (d) execute such amendments to the Loan Documents and Borrower's
organizational documents, enter into a lock-box or similar arrangement with
respect to the Rents and establish and fund such reserve funds (including
reserve funds for deferred maintenance and capital

                                       60

<PAGE>

improvements) as may be requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating
Agencies or otherwise to effect the Securitization, provided, that nothing
contained in this subsection (d) shall result in a material change in the
transaction.

In connection with only the initial Securitization, all reasonable third party
costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with Borrower's complying
with requests made under this Section 9.1 shall be paid by Borrower up to a
maximum amount equal to $147,000, which Borrower will deposit with Lender on the
Closing Date.

          Section 9.2 Securitization Indemnification. (a) Borrower understands
that certain of the Provided Information and the Required Records may be
included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including a prospectus or private placement memorandum (each, a "Disclosure
Document") and may also be included in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), or the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), or provided or made available to investors or prospective investors in
the Securities, the Rating Agencies, and service providers relating to the
Securitization. In the event that the Disclosure Document is required to be
revised prior to the sale of all Securities, Borrower will cooperate with the
holder of the Note in updating the Provided Information or Required Reports for
inclusion or summary in the Disclosure Document by providing all current
information pertaining to Borrower and the Properties necessary to keep the
Disclosure Document accurate and complete in all material respects with respect
to such matters.

          (b) In connection with each of (i) a preliminary and a private
placement memorandum or (ii) a preliminary and final prospectus, as applicable,
Borrower agrees to provide an indemnification certificate:

               (A) certifying that Borrower has carefully examined those
portions of such memorandum or prospectus, as applicable, pertaining to
Borrower, the Properties and the Loan including applicable portions of the
sections entitled "Special Considerations", "Description of the Mortgages",
"Description of the Mortgage Loans and Mortgaged Properties", "The Manager",
"The Borrower" and "Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loan", and such
sections (and any other sections reasonably requested and pertaining to
Borrower, the Properties or the Loan) to the best of Borrower's knowledge, do
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

               (B) indemnifying Lender and the affiliates of Nomura Securities
International, Inc. ("Nomura"), that has filed the registration statement
relating to the securitization (the "Registration Statement"), each of its
directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement and
each person or entity who controls Nomura within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act or Section 30 of the Exchange Act of 1933, as amended
(collectively, the "Nomura Group"), and Nomura, each of its directors and each
person who controls Nomura, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act

                                       61

<PAGE>

(collectively, the "Underwriter Group") for any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities to which Lender, the Nomura Group or the Underwriter Group may
become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
the applicable portions of such sections applicable to Borrower, the Properties
or the Loan, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated in the applicable
portions of such sections or necessary in order to make the statements in the
applicable portions of such sections or in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading (the "Liabilities"); and

               (C) agreeing to reimburse Lender and Nomura for any reasonable
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Lender and Nomura in connection
with investigating or defending the Liabilities. Borrower's Liability under
clauses (A), (B) and this (C) shall be limited to Liabilities arising out of or
based upon any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to Lender by Borrower, its
accountants, officers and employees in writing in connection with the
preparation of those portions of the memorandum or prospectus pertaining to
Borrower, the Properties or the Loan or in connection with the underwriting of
the debt, including financial statements of Borrower, operating statements,
occupancy statistics and room rates, rent rolls, environmental site assessment
reports and property condition reports with respect to the Properties. This
indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Borrower may
otherwise have.

          (c) In connection with filings under the Exchange Act, Borrower agrees
to (i) indemnify Lender, the Nomura Group and the Underwriter Group for any
Liabilities to which Lender, the Nomura Group or the Underwriter Group may
become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state in the Provided Information or Required
Records a material fact required to be stated in the Provided Information or
Required Records in order to make the statements in the Provided Information or
Required Records, in light of the circumstances under which they were made not
misleading and (ii) reimburse Lender or Nomura for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by Lender and Nomura in connection with defending or
investigating the Liabilities; provided that Borrower shall not be required to
indemnify Lender or Nomura in connection with any Liability arising from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender or Nomura.

          (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section
9.2 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under
this Section 9.2, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have
to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify
causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with
any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
(or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory

                                       62

<PAGE>

to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party under this Section 9.2 for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, if the
defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel unless there are legal
defenses available to it that are materially different from or additional to
those available to another indemnified party.

          (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 9.2(b) or
(c) is for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be indemnifiable under
Section 9.2(b) or 9.2(c), the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof); provided, however, that
no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the
amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, the
following factors shall be considered: (i) the Nomura Group's and Borrower's
relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect
to which claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any
statement or omission; and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate
in the circumstances. Lender and Borrower hereby agree that it may not be
equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per
capita allocation.

          Section 9.3 Rating Surveillance. Lender will retain the Rating
Agencies to provide rating surveillance services on any certificates issued in a
Securitization. The pro rata share of such rating surveillance will be at the
expense of Borrower.

          Section 9.4 Exculpation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
any of the Loan Documents, subject to the qualifications below, Lender shall not
enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the
obligations contained in the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgages or the other
Loan Documents by any action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be
sought against Borrower, except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, an
action for specific performance or any other appropriate action or proceeding to
enable Lender to enforce and realize upon its interest under the Note, this
Agreement, the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, or in the Properties, the
Rents, or any other collateral given to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents;
provided, however, that, except as specifically provided herein, any judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower only to the
extent of Borrower's interest in the Properties, in the Rents and in any other
collateral given to Lender, and Lender, by accepting the Note, this Agreement,
the Mortgages and the other Loan

                                       63

<PAGE>

Documents, agrees that it shall not sue for, seek or demand any deficiency
judgment against Borrower in any such action or proceeding under or by reason of
or under or in connection with the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgages or the
other Loan Documents. The provisions of this section shall not, however, (a)
constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or
secured by any of the Loan Documents; (b) impair the right of Lender to name
Borrower as a party defendant in any action or suit for foreclosure and sale
under the Mortgages; (c) affect the validity or enforceability of or any
guaranty made in connection with the Loan or any of the rights and remedies of
Lender thereunder; (d) impair the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a
receiver; (e) impair the enforcement of any of the Assignments of Leases; (f)
constitute a prohibition against Lender commence any other appropriate action or
proceeding in order for Lender to fully realize the security granted by the
Mortgages or to exercise its remedies against the Properties; or (g) constitute
a waiver of the right of Lender to enforce the liability and obligation of
Borrower, by money judgment or otherwise, to the extent of any loss, damage,
cost, expense, liability, claim or other obligation incurred by Lender
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection
with the following:

     (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower or any guarantor in
connection with the Loan;

     (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Borrower;

     (iii) the breach of any provision in that certain Environmental and
Hazardous Substance Indemnification Agreement of even date herewith given by
Borrower to Lender or in the Mortgages concerning environmental laws, hazardous
substances and asbestos and any indemnification of Lender with respect thereto
in either document;

     (iv) the removal or disposal of any portion of any Property after an Event
of Default (excluding any items which are replaced with items of reasonably
equivalent value);

     (v) the misapplication or conversion by Borrower of (A) any insurance
proceeds paid by reason of any loss, damage or destruction to any Property, (B)
any awards or other amounts received in connection with the condemnation of all
or a portion of any Property, or (C) any Rents following an Event of Default
(prior to any cure of such Event of Default); provided that Borrower shall not
be liable for any amounts applied to Debt Service, Approved Operating Expenses
or Approved Capital Expenses;

     (vi) failure to pay charges for labor or materials or other charges that
can create liens on any portion of any Property unless such charges are the
subject of a bona fide dispute in which Borrower is contesting the amount or
validity thereof;

     (vii) any security deposits collected with respect to the Properties which
are not delivered to Lender upon a foreclosure of or action in lieu thereof,
except to the extent any such security deposits were applied in accordance with
the terms and conditions of any of the Leases prior to the occurrence of the
Event of Default that gave rise to such foreclosure or action in lieu thereof;
and

                                       64

<PAGE>

     (viii) Borrower's indemnification of Lender set forth in Section 9.2.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents, Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any right which Lender may
have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provisions of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the Debt secured by the
Mortgages or to require that all collateral shall continue to secure all of the
Debt owing to Lender in accordance with the Loan Documents.

          Section 9.5 Retention of Servicer. Lender reserves the right to retain
the Servicer to act as its agent hereunder with such powers as are specifically
delegated to the Servicer by Lender, whether pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the Deposit Account Agreement

          Section 10.8 Headings. The Article and/or Section headings and the
Table of Contents in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of
reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other
purpose.

          Section 10.9 Severability. Wherever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement

          Section 10.10 Preferences. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or
payments to Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to
the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or
part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full
force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by
Lender.

          Section 10.11 Waiver of Notice. Borrower shall not be entitled to any
notices of any nature whatsoever from Lender except with respect to matters for
which this Agreement or the other Loan Documents specifically and expressly
provide for the giving of notice by Lender to Borrower and except with respect
to matters for which Borrower is not, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements,
permitted to waive the giving of notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the
right to receive any notice from Lender with respect to any matter for which
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents do not specifically and expressly
provide for the giving of notice by Lender to Borrower.

          Section 10.12 Remedies of Borrower. In the event that a claim or
adjudication is made that Lender or its agents, including Servicer, have acted
unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where by law or under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such agent, as the case
may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly, Borrower agrees that
neither Lender nor its agents, including Servicer, shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment plus reasonable costs
thereof (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees). The parties
hereto agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment.

          Section 10.13 Expenses; Indemnity. (a) Borrower covenants and agrees
to reimburse Lender (or the holder of the Loan, as applicable) upon receipt of
written notice from such holder for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Lender in connection
with (i) the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and all the costs of furnishing all opinions by
counsel for Borrower (including

                                       69

<PAGE>

any opinions requested by Lender as to any legal matters arising under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents with respect to the Properties); (ii)
Borrower's ongoing performance of and compliance with Borrower's respective
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date,
including confirming compliance with environmental and insurance requirements;
(iii) Lender's ongoing performance and compliance with all agreements and
conditions contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part
to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and administration of any consents, amendments,
waivers or other modifications to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and any other documents or matters requested by Lender; (v) Borrower complying
with any requests made pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof (subject to the
limitations contained in such section); (vi) the filing and recording fees and
expenses, title insurance and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for
providing to Lender all required legal opinions, and other similar expenses
incurred in creating and perfecting the Liens in favor of Lender pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vii) enforcing or preserving any
rights, in response to third party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any
action or proceeding or other litigation, in each case against, under or
affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Properties, or
any other security given for the Loan; and (viii) enforcing any obligations of
or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or with respect to the Properties or in connection with any
refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this
Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable for the
payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent the same arise by reason of
the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender or its
employees or agents. Any costs and expenses due and payable to Lender hereunder
which are not paid by Borrower within ten (10) days after demand may be paid
from any amounts in the Deposit Account, with notice thereof to Borrower.

               (b) Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless Lender from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
for Lender in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not Lender shall be designated a
party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Lender
in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) any breach by Borrower of its
obligations under, or any material misrepresentation by Borrower contained in
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, (ii) the use or intended use of the
proceeds of the Loan, or (iii) any information provided in writing by or on
behalf of Borrower, or contained in any documentation approved by Borrower in
writing and in any way relating to the issuance, offering and sale of the
Securities (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however,
that Borrower shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent
that such Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts,
fraud or willful misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to
indemnify and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall
contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under
applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by Lender.

          Section 10.14 Exhibits Incorporated. The Exhibits annexed hereto are
hereby incorporated herein as a part of this Agreement with the same effect as
if set forth in the body hereof.

          Section 10.15 Offsets. Counterclaims and Defenses. Any assignee of
Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan
Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets, counterclaims or
defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower may otherwise have
against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated counterclaim or
defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any action or proceeding
brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any such right to interpose
or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or defense in any such action
or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

          Section 10.16 No Joint Venture or Partnership. Borrower and Lender
intend that the relationships created hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents be solely that of borrower and lender. Nothing herein or therein is
intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint
tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor to grant Lender any
interest in the Properties other than that of mortgagee or lender.

          Section 10.17 Publicity. All news releases, publicity or advertising
by Borrower or their Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general
public which refers to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan
Documents, to Lender, Nomura, the Loan purchaser, the Servicer or the trustee in
a Securitization shall be subject to the prior written approval of Lender.

          Section 10.18 Waiver of Marshalling of Assets. To the fullest extent
Borrower may legally do so, Borrower waives all rights to a marshalling of the
assets of Borrower, Borrower's partners, if any, and others with interests in
Borrower, and of Borrower's Properties, or to a sale in inverse order of
alienation in the event of foreclosure of the interests hereby created, and
agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of
assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the
administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to
defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale
of the applicable Properties for the collection of the related Indebtedness
without any prior or different resort for collection, of the right of Lender or
any deed of trust trustee to the payment of the related Indebtedness out of the
net proceeds of a Property in preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In
addition, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the
event of foreclosure of any or all of the Mortgages, any equitable right
otherwise available to the Borrower which would require the separate sale of the
Properties or require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any Property or any
combination of the Properties before proceeding against any other Property or
combination of Properties; and further in the event of such foreclosure the
Borrower does hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at the option of
Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of any
combination of the Properties.

                                       71

<PAGE>

          Section 10.19 Waiver of Counterclaim. Borrower hereby waives the right
to assert a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or
proceeding brought against it by Lender or its agents, including Servicer.

          Section 10.20 Conflict: Construction of Documents. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any of the other Loan
Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. The parties hereto
acknowledge that they were represented by counsel in connection with the
negotiation and drafting of the Loan Documents and that such Loan Documents
shall not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the
party which drafted same.

          Section 10.21 Brokers and Financial Advisors. Borrower hereby
represents that it has dealt with no financial advisors, brokers, underwriters,
placement agents, agents or finders in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Borrower and Lender hereby agree to indemnify
and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
costs and expenses of any kind in any way relating to or arising from a claim by
any Person that such Person acted on behalf of the indemnifying party in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The provisions of this
Section 10.21 shall survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and
the repayment of the Debt.

          Section 10.22 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
other Loan Documents are solely for the benefit of Lender and the Borrower and
nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed
to confer upon anyone other than the Lender and the Borrower any right to insist
upon or to enforce the performance or observance of any of the obligations
contained herein or therein. All conditions to the obligations of Lender to make
the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Lender
and no other Person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such
conditions in accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that Lender
will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of strict compliance with any or all
thereof and no other Person shall under any circumstances be deemed to be a
beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of which may be freely waived in
whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole discretion, Lender deems it
advisable or desirable to do so.

          Section 10.23 Cross-Default: Cross Collateralization. Borrower
acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan to Borrower upon the security of its
collective interest in the Properties and in reliance upon the aggregate of the
Properties taken together being of greater value as collateral security than the
sum of the Properties taken separately. Borrower agrees that the Mortgages are
and will be cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with each other so that (i)
an Event of Default under any of the Mortgages shall constitute an Event of
Default under each of the other Mortgages which secure the Note; (ii) an Event
of Default under the Note or this Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default
under each Mortgage; and (iii) each Mortgage shall constitute security for the
Note as if a single blanket lien were placed on all of the Properties as
security for the Note.

agreements among or between such parties, whether oral or written, are
superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

to be duly executed by their duly authorized representatives, all as of the day
