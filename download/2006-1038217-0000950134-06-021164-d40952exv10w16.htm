Acceptance of the late charge shall not constitute a waiver of the default arising from the

Loans would be usurious under applicable law (including the laws of the State and the laws of the

any, provided for in the Loan Documents or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law,

United States of America permit the Lenders to contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive a
higher rate of interest than is allowed by the laws of the State of New York (whether such federal

provided. Without limiting the foregoing, Administrative Agent may (i)&nbsp;cause the Notes and

following:</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.1.1 <U>Amounts of Notes</U>. The amounts of the Notes executed by the respective
Borrowers represent a reasonable allocation of the Loans among the various Borrowers, taking into
account the value of the assets of each Borrower.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.1.2 <U>Disbursement and Direct Benefit</U>. Each Borrower&#146;s allocable share of the Loans
has been or, in accordance with this Agreement will be, disbursed to such Borrower or to
creditor(s) of such Borrower on account of reduction of such Borrower&#146;s indebtedness to such
creditor(s). The principal amount outstanding under each Borrower&#146;s Note represents direct benefit
received by such Borrower on account of the Loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.1.3 <U>Inducement</U>. The Lenders have been induced to make the Loans to Borrowers in
part based upon the assurances by each Borrower that each Borrower desires the Notes and Mortgages
to be honored and enforced as separate obligations of each Borrower, should Administrative Agent
and the Lenders desire to do so.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.1.4 <U>Separate Foreclosures</U>. Each Borrower desires and intends that the Notes and

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.1.5 <U>Combined Liability</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Loans constitute the
joint and several obligation of each and every Borrower, and Administrative Agent and the Lenders
may at their option enforce the entire amount of the Loans against any one or more Borrowers.
However, due to the operation of <U>Section&nbsp;13.1</U>, each Borrower acknowledges that as a
practical matter the amount of any Borrower&#146;s liability with respect to the Loans cannot exceed the
value of such Borrower&#146;s assets and thus the Loans cannot render any Borrower insolvent.

limitations set forth in the Mortgages, Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) may
exercise remedies against each Borrower and its property separately, whether or not Administrative
Agent exercises remedies against any other Borrower or its property. Administrative Agent may
enforce one or more Borrowers&#146; obligations without enforcing the other Borrowers&#146; obligations. Any
failure or inability of Administrative Agent to enforce one or more Borrowers&#146; obligations shall
not in any way limit Administrative Agent&#146;s right to enforce the obligations of any other Borrower.
If Administrative Agent forecloses or exercises similar remedies under any one or more
Mortgage(s), then such foreclosure or similar remedy shall be deemed to reduce the balance of the

foreclosure or similar remedy or, if applicable, Administrative Agent&#146;s credit bid at such sale,

actually secured by such Mortgage(s) under the applicable state law. If Administrative Agent

Mortgage executed by each Borrower is intended to secure the obligations of such Borrower under the
Secured Guaranty executed by such Borrower in an amount equal to the amount of all Loans, other
than the Loans represented and evidenced by the Notes executed by such Borrower and secured by the
related First Mortgage of such Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Borrowers&#146; request,
Administrative Agent and the Lenders have agreed that certain Second Mortgages shall secure an
amount (the &#147;<U>Apportioned Amount</U>&#148;) less than the amount of all Loans other than the Loans
represented and evidenced by the Notes executed by such Borrower and secured by the related First
Mortgage of such Borrower. With respect to each Second Mortgage securing an Apportioned Amount and
notwithstanding the Principal Repayment Allocations, each Borrower agrees that all amounts received
by Administrative Agent and the Lenders which are required or otherwise applied to payment of the
principal amount of the Loans shall first be applied to the principal amount of all Loans other
than those comprising any part (or all) of the Apportioned Amount (the &#147;<U>Excess

Administrative Agent may proceed against each or any Borrower with respect to the obligations of
such Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents without taking any actions against

remedies available to it against any Borrower without impairing Administrative Agent&#146;s rights and
remedies in enforcing the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement or the other Loan

Each Borrower agrees and acknowledges that Administrative Agent&#146;s exercise of certain of such

any) against any or all of the other Borrowers and that such Borrower may incur a partially or
totally non-reimbursable liability in performing its obligations under the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of any other waivers in this Agreement, each Borrower expressly waives any
statutory or other right that such Borrower might otherwise have to require Administrative Agent to
exhaust the collateral (or collateral held with respect to other Borrower(s)) before Administrative
Agent may proceed against the collateral owned by such Borrower.

advance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2. Each Borrower shall have submitted and Administrative Agent shall have approved (a)&nbsp;the
improvements to be constructed at its Project(s), (b)&nbsp;the plans and specifications for such
improvements, which plans and specifications may not be changed without Administrative Agent&#146;s
prior written consent, and (c)&nbsp;if requested by Administrative Agent, each contract or subcontract

approval of any such detailed budget, such budget may not be changed without Administrative Agent&#146;s
prior written consent. If the estimated cost of the improvements for any Project exceeds the
unadvanced portion of the amount allocated for such improvements at such Project in the approved

paid all Rent and other sums due under the Lease; and (iv)&nbsp;such tenant having executed and
delivered to Administrative Agent a tenant estoppel certificate affirming all of the foregoing and
such other matters as Administrative Agent may reasonably require.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">6. No Borrower shall use any portion of any improvements advance for payment of any other cost
except as specifically set forth in a request for advance approved by Administrative Agent in
writing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The &#147;<U><B>Monthly Interest Shortfall</B></U>&#148; will be calculated for each monthly Payment Date and means
the product of (1)&nbsp;the prepaid principal balance of the Loans divided by twelve (12), and (2)&nbsp;the
positive result, if any, from (a)&nbsp;the Treasury Rates used to calculate the Note A Interest Rates
and the Note B Interest Rates (plus a break contract fee of 20 basis points) minus (b)&nbsp;the
Replacement Treasury Rate (as hereinafter defined).

Securities/Treasury Constant Maturities for the week ending prior to the prepayment date, of U.S.
Treasury Constant Maturities with terms (one longer and one shorter) most nearly approximating the
remaining Weighted Average Life of the Loans (as hereinafter defined) as of the prepayment date.
In the event Release H.15 is no longer published, Administrative Agent shall select a comparable
publication to determine the Replacement Treasury Rate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The &#147;<U><B>Weighted Average Life of the Loans</B></U>&#148; will be determined as of the prepayment date by
(1)&nbsp;multiplying the amount of each monthly principal payment that would have been paid had the
prepayment not occurred by the number of months from the prepayment date to each Payment Date, (2)
adding the results, and (3)&nbsp;dividing the sum by the balance remaining on the Loans on the
prepayment date multiplied by twelve (12). If no monthly principal payments are required, the
Weighted Average Life of the Loans shall be the remaining term of the Loans as of the prepayment
