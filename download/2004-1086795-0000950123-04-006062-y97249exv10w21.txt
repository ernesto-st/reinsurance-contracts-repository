         2.01     REVOLVING LOANS AND THE TRANCHE B TERM LOAN.

         (a)      Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Revolving
Loan") to the Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the
Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the amount of such Lender's Revolving Commitment; provided, however,

such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations,
plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line
Loans shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving Commitment. Within the limits of
each Lender's Revolving Commitment, and subject to the other terms and
conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(a), prepay

may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein;
provided, however, all Borrowings made on the Closing Date shall be made as Base
Rate Loans.

         (b)      Tranche B Term Loan. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make its portion of a term loan
(the "Tranche B Term Loan") to the Borrower on the Closing Date in an amount not
to exceed such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan Commitment. Amounts repaid on the
Tranche B Term Loan may not be reborrowed. The Tranche B Term Loan may consist
of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein;
provided, however, all Borrowings made on the Closing Date shall be made as Base
Rate Loans.

         2.02     BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF COMMITTED LOANS.

         (a)      Each Committed Borrowing, each conversion of Committed Loans
from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be made upon the irrevocable notice from the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent, which may be given by telephone (provided that such telephonic notice
complies with the information requirements of the form of Committed Loan Notice
attached hereto). Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent
not later than (i) 2:00 p.m. three Business Days prior to the requested date of
any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and
(ii) 11:00 a.m. on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Committed
Loans; provided, however, all Committed Borrowings made on the Closing Date
shall be made as Base Rate Committed Loans. Each telephonic notice by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery
to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing

                                       33
<PAGE>

of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of
or conversion to Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed
Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the
Borrower is requesting a Committed Borrowing, a conversion of Committed Loans
from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the
requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be
(which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Committed Loans
to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Committed Loans to be
borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, and (v) if
applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the
Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or
if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or
continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be made as, or converted
to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be
effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect
to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing
of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such
Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be
deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.

         (b)      Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Pro
Rata Share of the applicable Committed Loans, and if no timely notice of a
conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Committed
Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Committed Loan available to
the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative
Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the
applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
set forth in Section 5.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit
Extension, Section 5.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so
received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of
such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and
reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided,
however, that if, on the date a Committed Loan Notice with respect to a
Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans is given by the Borrower, there are L/C
Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing first shall be
applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be
made available to the Borrower as provided above.

         (c)      Subject to Section 3.05, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may
be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans having
Interest Periods greater than one month without the consent of the Required
Lenders.

                                       34
<PAGE>

         (d)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The
determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans
are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the
Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

         (e)      After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all
conversions of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations
of Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than twelve (12)
Interest Periods in effect at any time outstanding.

         Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter
         of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account
         of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, and to amend or extend Letters of

         below, and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B)
         the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued
         for the account of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and any drawings

         plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C
         Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding
         Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving
         Commitment, or (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall
         not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by the Borrower
         for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to
         be a representation by the Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so
         requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the
         preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the
         terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain Letters
         of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may,
         during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace
         Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and
         reimbursed.

                  (ii)     The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit
         if:

                           (A)      subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry
                  date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than
                  twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension,
                  unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or

                                       35
<PAGE>

                           (B)      the expiry date of such requested Letter of
                  Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date,
                  unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date.

                  (iii)    The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to
         issue any Letter of Credit if:

                           (A)      any order, judgment or decree of any
                  Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms
                  purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such
                  Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or
                  any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
                  law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
                  the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer
                  refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or
                  such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the
                  L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any
                  restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C
                  Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect
                  on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any
                  unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on
                  the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems
                  material to it;

                           (B)      the issuance of such Letter of Credit would
                  violate any Laws or one or more policies of the L/C Issuer; or

                           (C)      except as otherwise agreed by the
                  Administrative Agent and the L/C Issue, such Letter of Credit
                  is in an initial face amount less than $100,000.

                           (D)      such Letter of Credit is to be denominated
                  in a currency other than Dollars;

                           (E)      such Letter of Credit contains any provision
                  for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any
                  drawing thereunder; or

                           (F)      a default of any Lender's obligations to
                  fund under Section 2.03(c) exists or any Lender is at such
                  time a Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the L/C Issuer has
                  entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender
                  that are satisfactory to the L/C Issuer to eliminate the L/C
                  Issuer's risk with respect to such Lender.

                  (iv)     The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit
         if the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such
         Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.

                  (v)      The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend
         any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at
         such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the
         terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not
         accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

         (b)      Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;
Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.

                  (i)      Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as
         the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
         Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a
         Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a
         Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application
         must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not
         later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date
         and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a
         particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed
         issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of
         a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of
         Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the
         L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of
         Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the
         expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary
         thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case
         of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be
         presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and
         (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a
         request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such
         Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail
         satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended;
         (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business
         Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other
         matters as the L/C Issuer may require. Additionally, the Borrower shall
         furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other
         documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit
         issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C
         Issuer or the Administrative Agent may require.

                  (ii)     Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
         Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent
         (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received
         a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if
         not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
         thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any
         Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one
         Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of
         the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more of the applicable
         conditions contained in Article V shall not then be satisfied, the L/C
         Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the
         account of the Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into
         the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in
         accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business
         practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
         Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such
         Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro
         Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

                  (iii)    If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter
         of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer shall, subject to the other terms
         and conditions in this Section 2.03, agree

                                       37
<PAGE>

         to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions
         (each, an "Auto-Extension Letter of Credit"); provided that any such
         Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent
         any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period
         (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by
         giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day
         (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in each such twelve-month period to
         be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued (but not
         less than five (5) Business Days before its expiration). Unless
         otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be
         required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such
         extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the
         Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the
         L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time
         to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;
         provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such
         extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be
         permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such
         Letter of Credit in its revised form under the terms hereof (by reason
         of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or
         otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or
         in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the
         Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the
         Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from
         the Administrative Agent that one or more of the applicable conditions
         specified in Section 5.02 is not then satisfied, and in each case
         directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

                  (iv)     Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit
         or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
         thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver
         to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy
         of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

         (c)      Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                  (i)      Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of
         Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C
         Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.
         Not later than 3:00 p.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer
         under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the
         Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative
         Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing; provided that
         the Borrower has received notice of such payment by 11:00 a.m. on such
         Honor Date, otherwise the Borrower shall make such payment not later
         than 11:00 a.m. on the following Business Day (together with interest
         thereon). If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such
         time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the
         Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed
         Amount"), and the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In
         such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing
         of Base Rate Revolving Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an
         amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum
         and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of
         Base Rate Committed Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized
         portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set
         forth in Section 5.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan
         Notice).

                                       38
<PAGE>

         Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant
         to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately
         confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate
         confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of
         such notice.

                  (ii)     Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C
         Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds
         available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
         at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata
         Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
         Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent,
         whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each
         Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a
         Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The
         Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C
         Issuer.

                  (iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not
         fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans because
         the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 cannot be satisfied or for any
         other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the
         L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount
         that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable
         on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the
         Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
         Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its
         participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance
         from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under
         this Section 2.03.

                  (iv)     Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C
         Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer
         for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of
         such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the
         account of the L/C Issuer.

                  (v)      Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or
         L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under
         Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be
         absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
         circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
         defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C
         Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B)
         the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other
         occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the
         foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make
         Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the
         conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than delivery by the
         Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance
         shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to
         reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C
         Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided
         herein.

                  (vi)     If any Lender fails to make available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount
         required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the

                                       39
<PAGE>

         foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in
         Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from
         such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such
         amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment
         is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
         to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
         from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted
         to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any
         amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent
         manifest error.

         (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                  (i)      At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment
         under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such
         Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
         Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account
         of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed
         Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or
         otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
         Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such
         Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case
         of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
         Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those
         received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (ii)     If any payment received by the Administrative Agent
         for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is
         required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
         Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
         L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata
         Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest
         thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
         returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect.

         (e)      Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to
repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter
         of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;

                  (ii)     the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off,
         defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at
         any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of
         Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such
         transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether
         in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby
         or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating
         thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                                       40
<PAGE>

                  (iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document
         presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
         transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
         drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                  (iv)     any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of
         Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
         strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment
         made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person
         purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
         assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
         representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of
         such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any
         proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                  (v)      any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
         circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
         a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

         The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and
each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of
noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the
Borrower will promptly notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively
deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

         (f)      Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that,
in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have
any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft,
certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the
L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with
the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any
action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or
Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to,
and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it
may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the
respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be
liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer,
and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the
extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages
suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C
Issuer's willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence or the

                                       41
<PAGE>

L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the
presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s)
strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept
documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of
any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason;
provided, however, that the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer,
and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the
extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages
suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C
Issuer's willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. Upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer will
provide a report of the outstanding Letters of Credit to the Borrower.

         (g)      Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
(i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if,
as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit for any reason
remains outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall
immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the
date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case
may be). Sections 2.05 and 9.02(c) set forth certain additional requirements to
deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.03, Section
2.05 and Section 9.02(c), "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with
or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and
the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account
balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby
consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding
meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash,
deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.
Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit
accounts at Bank of America.

         (h)      Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly
agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i)
the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the
rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most
recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time of
issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

         (i)      Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") for each Letter
of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount available
to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is
then in effect under such Letter of Credit). Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i)
computed on a quarterly basis in arrears, and (ii) due and payable on the first
Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the

                                       42
<PAGE>

issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any
quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and
multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter
that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any
Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default
Rate.

         (j)      Fronting Fee and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The
Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account (i) a one time
fronting fee for each commercial Letter of Credit equal to 0.25% times the
amount of such commercial Letter of Credit, due and payable at the time of
issuance and (ii) a fronting fee with respect to each standby Letter of Credit
in an amount equal to 0.25% per annum on the daily maximum amount available to
be drawn thereunder (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under
such Letter of Credit), due and payable quarterly in arrears on the Business Day
immediately following the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of
such standby Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
thereafter on demand. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and
other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer
relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary
fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are
nonrefundable.

         (k)      Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of
any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

         (l)      Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any
obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be
obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under
such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of
Letters of Credit for the account of any of its Subsidiaries inures to the
benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower's business derives substantial
benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.

         2.04     SWING LINE LOANS

         (a)      The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Swing
Line Loan") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing
Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of
Revolving Loans, the Tranche B Term Loan and L/C Obligations of the Lender
acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment;
provided, however, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the
Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of
any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the

                                       43
<PAGE>

Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's
Commitment, and provided, further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds
of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and
reborrow under this Section 2.04. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line
Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such
Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata
Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.

         (b)      Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made
upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than
2:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to
be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000 and (ii) the requested
borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must
be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after
receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the
Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan
Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent
(by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line
Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative
Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the date of
the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to
make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the
proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the
applicable conditions specified in Article V is not then satisfied, then,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not
later than 4:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan
Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower in
immediately available funds.

         (c)      Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.

                  (i)      The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and
         absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which
         hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on
         its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Revolving Loan in an
         amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing
         Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing
         (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice
         for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section
         2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for
         the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized
         portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in
         Section 5.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a
         copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering
         such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an
         amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such

                                       44
<PAGE>

         Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in
         immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at
         the Administrative Agent's Office on (A) the Business Day specified in
         such Committed Loan Notice, so long as such Committed Loan Notice is
         given not later than 12:00 noon on such Business Day, or (B) if such
         Committed Loan Notice is given after such time, the first Business Day
         next succeeding the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice,
         whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes
         funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan
         to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit
         the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.

                  (ii)     If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be
         refinanced by such a Committed Borrowing in accordance with Section
         2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Revolving Loans submitted by the
         Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request
         by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk
         participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender's payment
         to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender
         pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of
         such participation.

                  (iii)    If any Lender fails to make available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any
         amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section
         2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from
         such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such
         amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment
         is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
         to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
         Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line
         Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with
         respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be
         conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (iv)     Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or
         to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant
         to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
         not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off,
         counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may
         have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person
         for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a
         Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each
         Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section
         2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02. No such
         funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the
         obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with
         interest as provided herein.

         (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                  (i)      At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded
         a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender
         receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line
         Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata

                                       45
<PAGE>

         Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
         payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's risk
         participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the
         Swing Line Lender.

                  (ii)     If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in
         respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to
         be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances
         described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
         entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender
         shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand
         of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
         such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum
         equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make
         such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.

         (e)      Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line
Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing
Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Revolving Loan or risk
participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall
be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

         (f)      Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall
make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans
directly to the Swing Line Lender.

         2.05     PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)      Voluntary Prepayments of Loans.

                  (i)      Committed Loans. The Borrower may, upon notice to the
         Administrative Agent, at any time or from time (A) voluntarily prepay
         Base Rate Committed Loans in whole or in part without premium or
         penalty, and (B) subject to Section 3.05 hereof, voluntarily prepay
         Eurodollar Rate Loans in whole or in part on the last day of the
         applicable Interest Period without premium or penalty; provided that
         with respect to any such voluntary prepayment (A) such notice must be
         received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (1)
         three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate
         Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans;
         (B) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal
         amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof
         (or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding);
         (C) any prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal
         amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof
         (or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding),
         (D) any prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loan that occurs prior to the
         first anniversary of the Closing Date and is made with the proceeds of
         Debt issued for the purpose of refinancing of all or any portion of the
         Tranche B Term Loan shall be subject to an additional premium equal to
         the amount of such prepayment multiplied by 1.0%, and (E) any
         prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loan shall be applied (1) first, to
         the next four Principal Amortization Payments in direct order of
         maturities thereof, and (2) second, ratably to the remaining Principal
         Amortization Payments thereof. Each such notice shall specify the

                                       46
<PAGE>

         date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans
         to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each
         Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such
         Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by
         the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment
         amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
         specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
         accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any
         additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such
         prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in
         accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

                  (ii)     Swing Line Loans. The Borrower may, upon notice to
         the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any
         time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole
         or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (A) such notice
         must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent
         not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (B) any
         such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000.
         Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment.
         If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such
         prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due
         and payable on the date specified therein.

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (i)      Aggregate Revolving Commitments. If for any reason
         the Total Revolving Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately
         prepay Revolving Loans and/or the Swing Line Loans and/or Cash
         Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such
         excess; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to
         Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section
         2.05(b)(i) unless after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans
         and Swing Line Loans the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the
         Aggregate Revolving Commitments then in effect. Such prepayment shall
         be applied as set forth in clause (vii) below.

                  (ii)     Excess Cash Flow. Within one hundred twenty (120)
         days following the end of each Fiscal Year (beginning with the Fiscal
         Year ending December 31, 2004), the Borrower shall execute and deliver
         to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower's chief
         executive officer or chief financial officer demonstrating its
         calculation of Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year and shall prepay
         the Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount
         equal to (A) fifty percent (50%) of the annual Excess Cash Flow if the
         Leverage Ratio at the end of such Fiscal Year equals or is greater than
         2.50:1 or twenty-five percent (25%) of the annual Excess Cash Flow if
         the Leverage Ratio at the end of such Fiscal Year (after giving pro
         forma effect to making of such prepayment) is less than 2.50:1 minus
         (B) the amount of any voluntary prepayments of the Tranche B Term Loans
         and (to the extent accompanied by a reduction in the Aggregate
         Revolving Commitments) the Revolving Loans during such fiscal year
         pursuant to Section 2.05(a) minus (C) the amount of any mandatory
         prepayments pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(i) (such prepayment to be
         applied as set forth in clause (vii) below). Notwithstanding the
         forgoing, solely with respect to the Fiscal Year ending

                                       47
<PAGE>

         December 31, 2004, Excess Cash Flow shall be calculated from the period
         beginning April 1, 2004 and ending on December 31, 2004.

                  (iii)    Asset Dispositions. Within five (5) days after
         receipt by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds
         from any Asset Disposition, unless such proceeds may be reinvested in
         accordance with the definition of "Asset Disposition," the Borrower
         shall prepay the Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in
         an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds
         in excess of $2,000,000 in any Fiscal Year. In the event that such Net
         Cash Proceeds may be reinvested in accordance with the definition of
         "Asset Disposition" and were not reinvested within such one hundred
         eighty (180) day period as permitted thereby, then Borrower shall, on
         the first Business Day after such one hundred eighty (180) day period,
         prepay the then outstanding Loans and Cash Collateralize the L/C
         Obligations in an amount equal to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds
         which have not been so reinvested. In addition, the Borrower shall
         prepay the then outstanding Loans and Cash Collateralize the L/C
         Obligations in an amount necessary to avoid any mandatory prepayment or
         redemption of the Subordinated Notes with the cash proceeds of asset
         dispositions that have not otherwise been reinvested or applied in
         accordance with the Subordinated Notes Indenture. Such prepayments
         shall be applied as set forth in clause (vii) below.

                  (iv)     Debt Issuances. Within five (5) days after receipt by
         the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from any
         Debt Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or Cash
         Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal to one hundred
         percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayment to be applied
         as set forth in clause (vii) below).

                  (v)      Equity Issuances. Within five (5) days after receipt
         by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from
         any Equity Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or Cash
         Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal to fifty percent
         (50%) of such Net Cash Proceeds (such prepayment to be applied as set
         forth in clause (vii) below).

                  (vi)     Extraordinary Receipts. Within five (5) days after
         receipt of Net Cash Proceeds by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         from any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the
         account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and not otherwise
         included in clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, unless the Borrower or
         such Subsidiary intends in good faith to reinvest such proceeds in
         accordance with the definition of "Extraordinary Receipt," the Borrower
         shall prepay the then outstanding Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the
         L/C Obligations in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
         such Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $5,000,000 in any Fiscal Year (such
         prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vii) below).

                  (vii)    Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All amounts
         required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied
         as follows:

                                       48
<PAGE>

                           (A)      with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant
                  to Section 2.05(b)(i), to Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans
                  and (after all Revolving Loans and all Swing Line Loans have
                  been repaid) to Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations;

                           (B)      with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant
                  to Section 2.05(b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), or (vi):

                                    (1)      until the Tranche B Term Loan has
                           been paid in full, to prepay the Tranche B Term Loan
                           (with each such prepayment applied (x) first, to the
                           next four (4) Principal Amortization Payments in
                           direct order of maturities thereof and (y), second,
                           ratably to the remaining Principal Amortization
                           Payments); and

                                    (2)      after the Tranche B Term Loan has
                           been paid in full, to prepay any outstanding
                           Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans (without a
                           corresponding reduction of the Aggregate Revolving
                           Commitments) and, after all Revolving Loans and Swing
                           Line Loans have been repaid, to Cash Collateralize
                           L/C Obligations by a corresponding amount.

                  Within the parameters of the applications set forth above,
                  prepayments shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then
                  to Eurodollar Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period
                  maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.05(b) shall
                  be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or
                  penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal
                  amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

                  (viii)   Prepayment Account. If the Borrower is required to
         make a mandatory prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans under this Section
         2.05(b), the Borrower shall have the right, in lieu of making such
         prepayment in full, to deposit an amount equal to such mandatory
         prepayment with the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account
         maintained (pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent) by and in the sole dominion and control of the
         Administrative Agent. Any amounts so deposited shall be held by the
         Administrative Agent as collateral for the prepayment of such
         Eurodollar Rate Loans and shall be applied to the prepayment of the
         applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans at the end of the current Interest
         Periods applicable thereto. At the request of the Borrower, amounts so
         deposited shall be invested by the Administrative Agent in Cash
         Equivalents maturing prior to the date or dates on which it is
         anticipated that such amounts will be applied to prepay such Eurodollar
         Rate Loans; any interest earned on such Cash Equivalents will be for
         the account of the Borrower and the Borrower will deposit with the
         Administrative Agent the amount of any loss on any such Cash
         Equivalents to the extent necessary in order that the amount of the
         prepayment to be made with the deposited amounts may not be reduced.

         2.06     TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF AGGREGATE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS.

         The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be
received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business
Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial
reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any
concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Outstandings would exceed
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any
reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit
or Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments, such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such
excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such
notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments. Any
reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the
Revolving Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All
commitment fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such
termination.

         2.07     REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

         (a)      Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on
the Maturity Date thereof the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
outstanding on such date.

         (b)      Tranche B Term Loan. The Borrower shall repay the outstanding
principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan in twenty-seven (27) consecutive
quarterly installments, commencing on June 30, 2004 (as such installments may
hereafter be adjusted as a result of prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.05)
and final payment on the Maturity Date of the Tranche B Term Loan, unless
accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.02) as set forth in the following
table:

         (c)      Swing Line Loans. The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line
Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is ten Business Days after
such Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date thereof.

         2.08     INTEREST.

         (a)      Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

         (b)      (i)      If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid
         when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at
         stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall
         thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at
         all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted
         by applicable Laws.

                  (ii)     If any amount (other than principal of any Loan)
         payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due
         (after the expiration of any applicable grace periods), whether at
         stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of
         the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
         fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default
         Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

                  (iii)    Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts
         (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon
         demand.

         (c)      Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
         each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times
         as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable
         in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and
         before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor
         Relief Law.

         2.09     FEES.

         In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j) of
Section 2.03:

         (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a
commitment fee equal to 0.50% times the actual daily amount by which the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of
Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations. The
commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period,

                                       51
<PAGE>

including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article V is
not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business
Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such
date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date of the Revolving
Loans. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears.

         (b)      Fee Letter. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee
Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall be non-refundable
for any reason whatsoever.

         2.10     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

         All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is
determined by Bank of America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a
year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other
computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year
and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable,
being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue
on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion
is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is
made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day.

         2.11     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         (a)      The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced
by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a promissory note
which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or
records. Each such promissory note shall (i) in the case of Revolving Loans, be
in the form of Exhibit C-1 (a "Revolving Note"), and (ii) in the case of the
Tranche B Term Loan, be in the form of Exhibit C-2 (a "Tranche B Term Note").
Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type
(if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect
thereto.

         (b)      In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases
and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line
Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained

                                       52
<PAGE>

by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in
respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent
shall control in the absence of manifest error.

         2.12     PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

         (a)      All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on
the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of
such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending
Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

         (b)      If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a
day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following
Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing
interest or fees, as the case may be.

         (c)      Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it
to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such
payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make
available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds, then:

                  (i)      if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
         Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the
         portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender
         in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
         respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made
         available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such
         amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
         funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and

                  (ii)     if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
         Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
         amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest
         thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by
         the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
         recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
         then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the
         applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
         upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
         Agent

                                       53
<PAGE>

         may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall
         pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest
         thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the
         rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein
         shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill
         its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative
         Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any
         default by such Lender hereunder.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

         (d)      If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent
funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article V are not satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such
funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without
interest.

         (e)      The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed
Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are
several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan or
to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve
any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Committed Loan or purchase its participation.

         (f)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         2.13     SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall
obtain on account of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in
L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary,
involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in
excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof,
such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact,
and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Committed
Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C
Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect
of such Committed Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata
with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the
circumstances described in Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to
that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such
paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such paying

                                       54
<PAGE>

Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further
interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject
to Section 11.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section
shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests,
demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect
to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the
purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

                                   ARTICLE III
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         3.01     TAXES.

         (a)      Any and all payments by any Loan Party to or for the account
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the
Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is
organized or maintains a lending office (all such non-excluded taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Loan Party
shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions, (iii) such Loan Party
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the
date of such payment, such Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent
(which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy
of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

         (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery,

                                       55
<PAGE>

performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any
Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c)      If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes
or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent or to such Lender, as the case may be, at the time interest
is paid, such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender
specifies is necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all
taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other
Taxes had not been imposed.

         (d)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (ii)
amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including
additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
Payment under this subsection (d) shall be made within 30 days after the date
the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.

         (e)      If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or
for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01, then such Lender
agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal
and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the
making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such additional payment that may thereafter accrue if such change, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise materially disadvantageous
to such Lender.

         3.02     ILLEGALITY.

         If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent,
any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to
convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such
Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate
Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

                                       56
<PAGE>

         3.03     INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES.

         If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or
that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so
notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders
to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such
notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke without penalty or
premium any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such
request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount
specified therein.

         3.04     INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY; RESERVES
         ON EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

         (a)      If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law after the Closing Date,
or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost
to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar
Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of
Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in
connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection
(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or
Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis
of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States
or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under
the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, and (iii)
reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(c)), then from time to time
upon written demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

         (b)      If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending
Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital
of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of
such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with
respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then
from time to time upon written demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand
to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

         (c)      The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender
shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
"Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the

                                       57
<PAGE>

unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs
of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such
Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable
on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least 15 days' prior
notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest
from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant
Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 15 days
from receipt of such notice.

         (d)      If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or
for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.04, then such Lender
agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal
and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the
making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

         3.05     COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES.

         Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for
and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a
result of:

                  (a)      any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment
         of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,
         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than
         the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue
         or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the
         amount notified by the Borrower; or

                  (c)      any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day
         other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of
         a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.16;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

         3.06     MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION.

         (a)      A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such
Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

         (b)      Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under
Section 3.01 or 3.04, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 11.16.

         3.07     SURVIVAL.

         All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article III shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and repayment of all other
Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                    GUARANTY

         4.01     THE GUARANTY.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Swap Contract or a
Treasury Management Agreement with a Loan Party, and the Administrative Agent as
hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment
of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise)
strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further
agree that if any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally,
promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the
case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations,
the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity,
as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension
or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Loan Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management
Agreements, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest
amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under the
Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guaranty of Holdings
hereunder shall be further limited in accordance with Section 4.08.

         4.02     OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.01 are joint and
several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents, Swap
Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, or any other agreement or
instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release, impairment or
exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Obligations, and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other
circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor (other than payment in full), it
being the intent of this Section 4.02 that the obligations of the Guarantors
hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances.
Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation,
indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or any other
Guarantor for amounts paid under this Article IV until such time as the
Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations) have been irrevocably
paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not
alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain
absolute and unconditional as described above:

                  (a)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance
         shall be waived;

                  (b)      any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         any of the Loan Documents, any Swap Contract or Treasury Management
         Agreement between any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a
         Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan
         Documents, such Swap Contracts or such Treasury Management Agreements
         shall be done or omitted;

                  (c)      the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be
         accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented
         or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the Loan
         Documents, any Swap Contract or Treasury Management Agreement between
         any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any
         other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents, such
         Swap Contracts or such Treasury Management Agreements shall be waived
         or any other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security
         therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part
         or otherwise dealt with;

                  (d)      any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of
         the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

                  (e)      any of the Obligations shall be determined to be void
         or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any
         creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of
         any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any
         Guarantor).

                                       60

<PAGE>

         With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby
expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all
notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under
any of the Loan Documents, any Swap Contract or Treasury Management Agreement
between any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any
other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents, such Swap
Contracts or such Treasury Management Agreements, or against any other Person
under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations.

         4.03     REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article IV shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result
of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each
Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender
on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such
costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such
payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

         4.04     CERTAIN ADDITIONAL WAIVERS.

         Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of
recourse to security for the Obligations, except through the exercise of rights
of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.02 and through the exercise of rights of
contribution pursuant to Section 4.06.

         4.05     REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due
and payable as provided in Section 9.02 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section
9.02) for purposes of Section 4.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Obligations from
becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in
the event of such declaration (or the Obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), the Obligations (whether or not due and payable
by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors
for purposes of Section 4.01. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their
obligations hereunder are secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral
Documents and that the Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in
accordance with the terms thereof.

         4.06     RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, in connection
with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have a right of contribution
from each other Guarantor in accordance with applicable Law. Such contribution
rights shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Obligations
until such time as the as the Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full and
the Commitments have expired or terminated, and none of the Guarantors shall
exercise any such contribution rights until the Obligations have been
irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated.

         4.07     GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The guarantee in this Article IV is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations
whenever arising.

         4.08     GUARANTEE OF HOLDINGS TO BE LIMITED RECOURSE.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IV, elsewhere
in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Guaranty of Holdings
provided hereunder and any other obligations relating thereto shall be
non-recourse to Holdings except to the extent of the Collateral of Holdings that
will be pledged by Holdings pursuant to the Holdings Pledge Agreement to secure
the Obligations.

                  as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to the initial
                  Credit Extensions) to adjusted EBITDA is not greater than 4.65
                  to 1.0.

                  (f)      No Material Adverse Change. There shall not have
         occurred a material adverse change since December 31, 2003 in the
         business, assets, liabilities (actual or contingent), operations,
         condition (financial or otherwise) or management of the Holdings and
         its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Agent, as pledgee for the benefit of the Lenders under the Security Agreement
and the Holdings Pledge Agreement together with the delivery of the certificates
pursuant thereto and delivery of appropriate endorsements executed in blank,
constitute first perfected security interests in the Subsidiary Equity and
Pledged Shares (as such terms are defined in the Security Agreement and the
Holdings Pledge Agreement, respectively) pledged under such agreements, subject

on which penalties attach thereto) all taxes shown thereon to be due, together
with applicable interest and penalties (other than de minimus taxes which are
not overdue more than thirty (30) days and any taxes the amount or validity of
which are being contested in good faith and with respect to which the Borrower
or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto in accordance with GAAP).

and foreign tax liability of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries proposed
by any state, local or foreign

company," or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter"
for, an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither the making of any Borrowing, nor the
issuance of any Letters of Credit, nor the application of the proceeds or
repayment thereof by the Borrower, will violate any provision of such Act or any
rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder
or any takeover, disclosure or other federal, state or foreign securities law or
Regulations T, U or X issued by the FRB. The Borrower is not subject to
regulation under any federal, state or foreign statute or regulation which
limits its ability to incur Debt.

under any agreement, ordinance, resolution, decree, bond, note, indenture, order
or judgment to which it is a party or by which it is bound, or any other
agreement or other instrument by which any of the properties or assets owned by
it or used in the conduct of its business is affected, which default could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b)      The Borrower, each of its Subsidiaries, each Related
Professional Corporation and each professional officer, director, employee or
contractor of any of the foregoing (in so far as related to services provided in
respect of the Borrower or any Subsidiary by any such officer, director,
employee or contractor) has complied and is in compliance in all respects with
all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, resolutions, decrees and other
similar documents and instruments of all courts and governmental authorities,
bureaus and agencies, domestic and foreign and all applicable Environmental Laws
and Regulations, non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

the extent the failure to so own or have such rights could not reasonably be

interference with any patent, trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright or
other intellectual property of any other Person except to the extent that could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

authorizations, franchises, certificates, and inspections of all Governmental
Authorities and that are otherwise necessary for such Loan Party to continue to
conduct business and own, use, operate, and maintain its property and assets as
heretofore conducted, owned, used, operated, and maintained which, if not
obtained (whether directly or by lawful and effective assignment) or not
maintained in good standing, would have a Material Adverse Effect. No such
approval, permit, license, consent, authorization, franchise, or certificate is
conditioned or limited (in any material respect) any more so than as is
generally the case with respect to Persons engaged in the same or similar lines
of business. Each such approval, permit, license, consent, authorization,
franchise, or certificate was duly and validly granted or issued, is in full
force and effect, and neither has been suspended, rescinded, revoked, forfeited,
or assigned to a party other than the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
Further, no conditions exist or events have occurred that, with the giving of
notice or lapse of time or both, could result in the amendment, modification,
suspension, rescission, revocation, forfeiture, or non-renewal of any such
approval, permit, license, consent, authorization, franchise, or certificate.

other federal and state funded health care reimbursement programs, where such

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect either individually or
in the aggregate.

         9.01     EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

         If any of the following ("Events of Default") shall occur and be
continuing:

         (a)      Payment. (a) The Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of
any Loan or L/C Obligation when the same shall become due and payable or (b) the
Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or L/C Obligation, or any
Loan Party shall fail to make any other payment under any Loan Document, in each
case under this clause (b) within five (5) Business Days after the same becomes
due and payable (excluding for purposes hereof a Guarantor's failure to pay
obligations arising under Swap Contracts and Treasury Management Agreements as
required by Section 4.01); or

         (b)      Representations and Warranties. Any representation or warranty
made by any Loan Party (or any of its officers) under or in connection with any

observe any term, covenant or agreement contained in Section 7.03(a), 7.09, 7.14

         (d)      Other Covenants. Any Loan Party shall fail to perform any
other term, covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document on its part to
be performed or observed (other than Section 4.01 as such Section applies to a
Guarantor's covenant to pay or perform obligations arising under Swap Contracts
and Treasury Management Agreements if such obligations were not paid or
performed when required) if such failure shall remain unremedied for thirty (30)
days or, in the case of Section 7.01, five (5) Business Days, after the date on
which written notice thereof shall have been given to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent; or

<PAGE>

outstanding in a principal or notional amount of at least $10,000,000 either
individually or in the aggregate (but excluding Debt outstanding hereunder) of
the Borrower or such Subsidiary (as the case may be), when the same becomes due
and payable (whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration,
demand or otherwise); or any other event shall occur or condition shall exist
under any agreement or instrument relating to any such Debt, in each case if the
effect of such event or condition is to accelerate, or to permit the
acceleration of, the maturity of such Debt or otherwise to cause, or to permit
the holder thereof to cause, such Debt to mature; or any such Debt shall be
declared to be due and payable or required to be prepaid or redeemed (other than
by a regularly scheduled required prepayment or redemption), purchased or
defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease such Debt shall be
required to be made, in each case prior to the stated maturity thereof; or

         (f)      Bankruptcy, Etc. The Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries

any proceeding shall be instituted by or against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Immaterial Subsidiaries) seeking to adjudicate it a
bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts
under any Debtor Relief Laws, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the
appointment of a receiver, trustee or other similar official for it or for any
substantial part of its property and, in the case of any such proceeding
instituted against it (but not instituted by it), either such proceeding shall
remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of forty-five (45) days or any of
the actions sought in such proceeding (including, without limitation, the entry
of an order for relief against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee,
custodian or other similar official for, it or any substantial part of its
property) shall occur, or the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
Immaterial Subsidiaries) shall take any corporate action to authorize any of the
actions set forth above in this Section 9.01(f); or

excess of $10,000,000 (other than such a judgment or order which is fully
covered by insurance for which the appropriate insurer has acknowledged
responsibility in writing) shall be rendered against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries and either (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by
any creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) such judgments or orders shall
not have been vacated, discharged, satisfied or bonded pending appeal within
thirty (30) days of entry thereof; or

         (h)      Loan Documents. Any material provision of any Loan Document

                  (i)      Any ERISA Event shall have occurred with respect to a
         Plan and the sum (determined as of the date of occurrence of the last
         such ERISA Event) of the Insufficiency of such Plan and the
         Insufficiency of any and all other Plans with respect to which an ERISA
         Event shall have occurred and then exist (or the liability of the
         Borrower and the ERISA Affiliates related to such ERISA Events) exceeds
         $10,000,000; or

                  (ii)     The Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that it has incurred
         Withdrawal Liability to such Multiemployer Plan in an amount that, when
         aggregated with all other amounts required to be paid to Multiemployer
         Plans by the Borrower and the ERISA Affiliates as Withdrawal Liability
         (determined as of the date of such notification), exceeds $10,000,000;
         or

                  (iii)    The Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
         Plan is in reorganization or is being terminated, within the meaning of
         Title IV of ERISA, and as a result of such reorganization or
         termination the aggregate annual contributions of the Borrower and the
         ERISA Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans that are then in
         reorganization or being terminated have been or will be increased over
         the amounts contributed to such Multiemployer Plans for the plan years
         of such Multiemployer Plans immediately preceding the plan year in
         which such reorganization or termination occurs by an amount exceeding
         $10,000,000; or

         (l)      Subordination Provisions. The subordination provisions
contained in any instrument pursuant to which the Subordinated Debt permitted
under Section 8.02(c)(iii) was created or in any instrument evidencing such
Subordinated Debt shall cease, for any reason, to be in full force and effect or
enforceable in accordance with their terms (other than as the result of payment
or prepayment in accordance with the terms hereof); or

         (m)      Matters Relating to Regulatory Agencies.

                  (i)      Any Regulatory Agency shall commence a hearing on the
         renewal of any material license, consent, authorization, permit,
         certificate, franchise held by any the Borrower, any of its
         Subsidiaries, Related Professional Corporation, or professional
         employee, officer, director or contractor of any the Borrower, any of
         its Subsidiaries or Related Professional Corporation if there is a
         significant probability that result thereof will be the termination,
         revocation, suspension or material adverse amendment of any such
         license, consent, authorization, permit, certificate, franchise that
         would have a Material Adverse Effect; or

                                      103

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     Any Regulatory Agency shall commence an action or
         proceeding seeking the termination, suspension, revocation or material
         adverse amendment of any license, consent, authorization, permit,
         certificate, franchise held by the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries,
         Related Professional Corporation, or professional employee, officer,
         director or contractor of the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower
         or Related Professional Corporation if the result thereof is likely to
         be the termination, suspension, revocation or material adverse
         amendment of any license, consent, authorization, permit, certificate,
         franchise that would have a Material Adverse Effect; or

         (n)      Related Professional Corporation Termination. The Borrower's
or any of its Subsidiaries' contractual arrangements with a material portion of
the Related Professional Corporations shall be terminated and not replaced by
other similar contractual arrangements unless the Borrower shall have elected to
terminate (or permit to expire) those of the Related Professional Corporation
contracts as being unnecessary to the future conduct of its business;

         (o)      Insurance Subsidiary. Any Insurance Subsidiary shall become
subject to any conservation, rehabilitation, liquidation order, directive or
mandate issued by any Regulatory Agency which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect; or

         (p)      Designated Senior Debt. Any of the Obligations for any reason
shall cease to be "Designated Senior Debt" within the meaning and pursuant to
the terms of the Subordinated Notes Indenture or any Contract evidencing or
governing any other Subordinated Debt.

         9.02     REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT.

         If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative
Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required
Lenders, take any or all of the following actions:

                  (a)      declare the commitment of each Lender to make Loans
         and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to
         be terminated, whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be
         terminated;

                  (b)      declare the unpaid principal amount of all
         outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all
         other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan
         Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment,
         demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
         expressly waived by the Borrower;

                  (c)      require that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the L/C
         Obligations (in an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount
         thereof); and

                  (d)      exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all
         rights and remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan
         Documents or applicable law;

                                      104

<PAGE>

         provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed
         entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the
         Bankruptcy Code of the United States, the obligation of each Lender to
         make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit
         Extensions shall automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount
         of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other amounts as
         aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the
         obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as
         aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without
         further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         9.03     APPLICATION OF FUNDS.

         After the acceleration of the Obligations as provided for in Section
9.02(b) (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and
payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash
Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 9.02), any amounts
received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent in the following order:

         First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including Attorney Costs and amounts
payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity
as such;

         Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable
to the Lenders (including Attorney Costs and amounts payable under Article III),
ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second
payable to them;

         Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans, L/C Borrowings and other Obligations,
ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in
this clause Third payable to them;

         Fourth, (a) payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting
unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, (b) payment of breakage,
termination or other amounts owing in respect of any Swap Contract between any
Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, to the extent such Swap
Contract is permitted hereunder, (c) payments of amounts due under any Treasury
Management Agreement between any Loan Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of
a Lender and (d) the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, to
Cash Collateralize that portion of the L/C Obligations comprised of the
aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit, ratably among such parties in
proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by
them;

         Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

         Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the
aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fourth above
shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur.
If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral

                                      105

<PAGE>

after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such
remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order
set forth above.

                                    ARTICLE X
                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         10.01    APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a)      Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

         (b)      The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to
the Administrative Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for
letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative Agent" as used in this Article X and in the definition of
"Agent-Related Person" included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C
Issuer.

         10.02    DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other
consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

                                      106

<PAGE>

         10.03    LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties
expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender
or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by
any Loan Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan
Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party
to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or
any Affiliate thereof.

         10.04    RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a)      The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan
Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (of, if applicable, all of the
Lenders) as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected
in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or
such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any
instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

         (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 5.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
specifying its objection thereto.

                                      107

<PAGE>

         10.05    NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default." The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its
receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance
with Article IX; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative
Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of
the Lenders.

         10.06    CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT.

         Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person
to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have
disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any
Agent-Related Person.

         10.07    INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the
obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro

                                      108

<PAGE>

rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided,
however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required
Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for
purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall
reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any
costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or
any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the
resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         10.08    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates
as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent
shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect
to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though
it were not the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms "Lender"
and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

         10.09    SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' notice to the Lenders; provided that any such resignation by Bank of
America shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swing Line
Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required
Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent
for the Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by
the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default
(which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of
the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor
administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the

                                      109

<PAGE>

acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the
Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and
Swing Line Lender and the respective terms "Administrative Agent," "L/C Issuer"
and "Swing Line Lender" shall mean such successor administrative agent and
Letter of Credit issuer and swing line lender, and the retiring Administrative
Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be
terminated and the retiring L/C Issuer's and Swing Line Lender's rights, powers
and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed
on the part of such retiring L/C Issuer, Swing Line Lender or any other Lender,
other than the obligation of the successor L/C Issuer to issue letters of credit
in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of
such succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C
Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with
respect to such Letters of Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X
and Sections 11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or
Swing Line Lender under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has
accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days
following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
agent as provided for above.

         10.10    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then
be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise

                  (a)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C
         Obligations and all other Obligations (other than obligations under
         Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements to which the
         Administrative Agent is not a party) that are owing and unpaid and to
         file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
         have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including
         any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
         advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
         respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and
         the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.08 and
         11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

                  (b)      to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

                                      110

<PAGE>

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 11.04.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

         10.11    COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS.

         The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its
option and in its discretion,

                  (a)      to release any Lien on any property granted to or
         held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon
         termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and payment in full
         of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations)
         and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that
         is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with
         any Asset Disposition permitted hereunder or under any other Loan
         Document, or (iii) subject to Section 11.01, if approved, authorized or
         ratified in writing by the Required Lenders;

                  (b)      to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or
         held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder
         of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 8.01(d); and

                  (c)      to release any Guarantor from its obligations under
         the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a
         transaction permitted hereunder.

         Subject to Section 11.01, upon request by the Administrative Agent at
any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative
Agent's authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or
items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the
Guaranty pursuant to this Section 10.11.

         10.12    OTHER AGENTS; ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS.

         None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or
signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent," "documentation
agent," "co-agent," "book manager," "lead manager," "arranger," "lead arranger"
or "co-arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, in the case of such
Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the
foregoing, none of the

                                      111

<PAGE>

Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not
relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified
in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action
hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.01    AMENDMENTS, ETC.

         No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan
Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required
Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, and
acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however,

         (a)      no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

                           (i)      extend or increase the Commitment of a
                  Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to
                  Section 9.02) without the written consent of such Lender (it
                  being understood and agreed that a waiver of any condition
                  precedent set forth in Section 5.02 or of any Default or
                  mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not constitute a
                  change in the terms of any Commitment of any Lender);

                           (ii)     postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or
                  any other Loan Document for any payment (excluding mandatory
                  prepayments) of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due
                  to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other
                  Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender
                  directly affected thereby;

                           (iii)    reduce the principal of, or the rate of
                  interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or
                  any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other
                  Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender
                  directly affected thereby; provided, however, that only the
                  consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend
                  the definition of "Default Rate" or to waive any obligation of
                  the Borrower to pay interest or Letter of Credit Fees at the
                  Default Rate;

                           (iv)     change Section 2.13 or Section 9.03 in a
                  manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
                  required thereby without the written consent of each Lender;

                                      112

<PAGE>

                           (v)      change any provision of this Section
                  11.01(a) or the definition of "Required Lenders" without the
                  written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

                           (vi)     except as the result of or in connection
                  with an Asset Disposition not prohibited by Section 8.04,
                  release all or substantially all of the Collateral without the
                  written consent of each Lender; or

                           (vii)    except as the result of or in connection
                  with a dissolution, merger or disposition of a Loan Party not
                  prohibited by Section 8.03 or Section 8.04, release the
                  Borrower or substantially all of the other Loan Parties from
                  its or their obligations under the Loan Documents without the
                  written consent of each Lender;

                  (b)      prior to the termination of the Revolving
         Commitments, without the consent of Lenders (other than Defaulting
         Lenders) holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the Revolving
         Commitments, no such amendment, waiver or consent shall (i) waive any
         Default for purposes of Section 5.02(b), (ii) amend, change, waive,
         discharge or terminate Sections 5.02 or 9.01 without the consent of
         each such Lender directly affected thereby or (iii) amend, change,
         waive, discharge or terminate Section 8.12 (or any defined term used
         therein) or this Section 11.01(b);

                  (c)      without the consent of Lenders (other than Defaulting
         Lenders) holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the
         outstanding Tranche B Term Loan (and participations therein), no such
         amendment, waiver or consent shall (i) amend, change, waive, discharge
         or terminate Section 2.05(b)(vii) so as to alter the manner of
         application of proceeds of any mandatory prepayment required by Section
         2.05(b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) hereof (other than to allow the
         proceeds of such mandatory prepayments to be applied ratably with other
         term loans under this Agreement) or (ii) amend, change, waive,
         discharge or terminate this Section 11.01(c) (other than to provide
         other term loan Lenders with proportional rights under this Section
         11.01(c));

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to the Lenders required above,
affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Letter
of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by
it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; (iii) no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document; and (iv) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges
thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto.

         For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Section 11.01, this Agreement may be amended (or
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Loan Parties and the
Required Lenders to add one or more additional tranches of Loans to the
Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time

                                      113

<PAGE>

outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to
share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and other Loan Documents with
the other then outstanding Obligations.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender
shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent
hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or
extended without the consent of such Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States supersedes the
unanimous consent provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders shall
determine whether or not to allow a Loan Party to use cash collateral in the
context of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and such determination shall be
binding on all of the Lenders.

         11.02    NOTICES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS; FACSIMILE COPIES.

         (a)      General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing

certified or registered mail, faxed or delivered to the applicable address,
facsimile number or (subject to subsection (c) below) electronic mail address,
and all notices and other communications expressly permitted hereunder to be
given by telephone shall be made to the applicable telephone number, as follows:

                  (i)      if to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the L/C
         Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, to the address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number specified for such Person
         on Schedule 11.02 or to such other address, facsimile number,
         electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be designated by
         such party in a notice to the other parties; and

                  (ii)     if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in its
         Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address, facsimile
         number, electronic mail address or telephone number as shall be
         designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender

Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or
registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices sent
by facsimile shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not
given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have
been given at the opening of business on the next business day for the
recipient). Notices delivered through electronic communications to the extent
provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such
subsection (b).

                                      114

         (b)      Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to
the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication
(including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures
approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender has
notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices
under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the
Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other
communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

         (c)      Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the
same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all
Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a
manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request
or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document
or signature.

         (b)      Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any
notices (including telephonic Committed Loan Notices and Swing Line Loan
Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such
notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not
preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the
terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation
thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender
from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by
such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower.
All telephonic notices to and other communications with the Administrative Agent
may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto
hereby consents to such recording.

         11.03    NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.

         No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and
no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

         11.04    ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES.

         The Loan Parties jointly and severally agree (a) to pay or reimburse
the Administrative Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses

execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendment,
waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are
consummated),

                                      115

<PAGE>

and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including all Attorney Costs, and (b) to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or
preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout"
or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding,
including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney
Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include all search, filing,
recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes related
thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
and the cost of independent public accountants and other outside experts
retained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender; provided that such outside
experts were retained with the Borrower's consent or otherwise in accordance
with the terms of the Loan Documents. All amounts due under this Section 11.04
shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

         11.05    INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BORROWER.

         The Loan Parties jointly and severally shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, trustees, advisors, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs)
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out
of or in connection with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance
or administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or
instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment,
Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom
(including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do
not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (c) any actual or
alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
currently or formerly owned or operated by the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any
other Loan Party, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party, or (d) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials
obtained through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in
connection with this Agreement, nor shall any Indemnitee

                                      116

<PAGE>

have any liability for any indirect or consequential damages relating to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its activities in
connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date). All
amounts due under this Section 11.05 shall be payable within ten Business Days
after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the
termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

         11.06    PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.

         To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Loan Party is
made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or
any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of
such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then
(a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b)
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its
applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
time in effect.

         11.07    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this
Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject
to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted
assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this
Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

         (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for
purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and Swing
Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment
and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a
Lender or an Affiliate of a

                                      117

<PAGE>

Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this Section) with
respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this
purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment,
determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is
specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be
less than (A) with respect to an assignment of Revolving Commitment and/or
Revolving Loans, $5,000,000 and (B), with respect to an assignment of Tranche B
Term Loans, $1,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise
consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part
of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii)
shall not apply to rights in respect of Swing Line Loans, (iii) any assignment
of a Revolving Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent, the L/C
Issuer and the Swing Line Lender unless the Person that is the proposed assignee
is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify
as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together
with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and
recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this
Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 11.04 and 11.05 with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon
request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the
assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request
for a consent for a material or other substantive change to the Loan Documents
is pending, any Lender wishing to consult with other Lenders in connection
therewith may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the
Register.

                                      118

<PAGE>

         (d)      Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C
Obligations and Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 11.01(a) that
directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section,
the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 11.09 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender.

         (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
11.15 as though it were a Lender.

         (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

         (g)      As used herein, the following terms have the following
meanings:

                  "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a
         Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a
         natural person) approved by (i) the Administrative Agent and (ii) with
         respect to an assignment of a Revolving Commitment and/or Revolving
         Loans only, the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender and (unless an Event
         of Default has occurred and is continuing) the Borrower (each such
         approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that
         notwithstanding the

                                      119

<PAGE>

         foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall not include the Borrower or any of
         the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

                  "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
         (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise
         investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the
         ordinary course of its business.

                  "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed
         by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an
         Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

         (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to
subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon 30 days' notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30 days' notice
to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such
resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled
to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender
hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any
such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or
Swing Line Lender. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all
the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all
Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C
Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to
require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk
participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of
America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the
Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made
by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including
the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk
participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

         11.08    CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its Affiliates' respective
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and representatives
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it; (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d)
to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible
Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii)
any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or
such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional
advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the
Loan

                                      120

<PAGE>

Parties; (g) with the written consent of the Borrower; (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (i) to the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar
organization. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose
the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market
data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service
providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the
administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their
respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any Person required to maintain
the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

         11.09    SET-OFF.

         In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law,
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default after
obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Lender is
authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the
Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower
(on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other
indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the respective Loan Parties, and each Loan Party hereby grants a
security interest in all such deposits and indebtedness to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, against any
and all Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan
Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the
Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or
unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable
deposit or indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such set-off and application.

         11.10    INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan
Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall
not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law
(the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive
interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall
be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid

                                      121

<PAGE>

principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal
parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder.

         11.11    COUNTERPARTS.

         This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

         11.12    INTEGRATION.

         This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the
complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such
subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement
shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in
favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document
shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was
drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall
be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance
with the fair meaning thereof.

         11.13    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection
herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and
thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by
the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

         11.14    SEVERABILITY.

         If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall
endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         11.15    TAX FORMS.

         (a)      (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" within
         the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign Lender")
         shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, prior to
         receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon
         accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed
         completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto
         (relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to an exemption from,
         or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such
         Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form
         W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to
         such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such
         other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or
         reduction of, U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption pursuant to
         Section 881(c) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each such
         Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent
         and the Borrower such additional duly completed and signed copies of
         one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from
         time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may
         then be available under then current United States laws and regulations
         to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of,
         United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made
         to such Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (B)
         promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of any change
         in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
         exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be
         materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such
         Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the
         re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of
         applicable Laws that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for
         taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

                  (ii)     Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or
         ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any
         sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents
         (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender),
         shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower on the date
         when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect
         to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other
         times as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative
         Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly
         signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be
         provided by such Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of
         any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts
         for its own account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and
         (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any
         successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses
         to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of
         exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not
         acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums
         payable to such Lender.

                                      123

<PAGE>

                  (iii)    The Borrower shall not be required to pay any
         additional amount to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with
         respect to any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld on the basis
         of the information, certificates or statements of exemption such Lender
         transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant to this Section 11.15(a) or
         (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender shall
         have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the date
         such Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with
         respect to any payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this
         Section 11.15(a) shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay
         any amounts pursuant to Section 3.01 in the event that, as a result of
         any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule,
         regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
         administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer
         properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
         subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person
         for the account of which such Lender receives any sums payable under
         any of the Loan Documents is not subject to withholding or is subject
         to withholding at a reduced rate.

                  (iv)     The Administrative Agent may, without reduction,
         withhold any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any
         payment under any of the Loan Documents with respect to which the
         Borrower is not required to pay additional amounts under this Section
         11.15(a).

         (b)      Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that
is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies
of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an
amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code,
without reduction.

         (c)      If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative
Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax
or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all
penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent. The obligation of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate
Revolving Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the
resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         11.16    REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

         (a) Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under Section
3.01 or 3.04 or (b) so long as no Default exists, if any Lender (a
"Non-Consenting Lender") refuses to consent to an amendment, modification or
waiver of this Credit Agreement that, pursuant to Section 11.01, requires 100%
of the Lenders or 100% of the Lenders with Obligations directly affected, then
Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, replace
such Lender

                                      124

<PAGE>

by causing such Lender to assign its Commitment and outstanding Loans (with the
assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) pursuant to Section
11.07(b) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible Assignees procured by the
Borrower. Upon the making of any such assignment, the Borrower shall (x) pay in
full all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such Lender
through the date of replacement (including any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.05), and (y) provide appropriate assurances and indemnities (which may
include letters of credit) to the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender as each
may reasonably require with respect to any continuing obligation to fund
participation interests in any L/C Obligations or any Swing Line Loans then
outstanding. Each Eligible Assignee of a Non-Consenting Lender shall consent, at
the time of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Lender was
a Non-Consenting Lender and the Borrower also requires.

         11.17    GOVERNING LAW.

         (a)      THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, the LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK applicable to agreements made
and to be performed entirely within such State; PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE
Agent AND EACH LENDER SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

         (b)      ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT
