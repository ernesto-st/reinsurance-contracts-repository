                              ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

      THIS ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT"), is made and entered into as
of the 12th day of August, 2002 by and among GAINSCO Service Corp., a Texas
corporation ("SELLER"), and GAINSCO, INC., a Texas corporation that is the
parent company of Seller ("GAINSCO") (collectively, "SELLERS"), Berkeley
Management Corporation, a Texas corporation ("PURCHASER"), Liberty Mutual
Insurance Company, a Massachusetts stock insurance company ("LIBERTY"), and
GAINSCO County Mutual Insurance Company, a Texas county mutual insurance company
(the "COMPANY"), pursuant to which Sellers shall sell and Purchaser shall
acquire the rights to manage and control the Company.

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, the Company is authorized in the State of Texas to do business as
a county mutual insurance company pursuant to Chapter 17 of the Texas Insurance
Code.

      WHEREAS, the Company is managed and controlled pursuant to the terms of a
Management Contract by and between the Company and Seller dated October 12, 1992
(the "MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT").

      WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to acquire from Sellers, and Sellers desire to
sell to Purchaser, the exclusive authority and right to manage and control the
Company under the terms of the Management Agreement.

      WHEREAS, Purchaser's intent in acquiring the Management Agreement is that,
as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.4 hereof), the Company shall be
a "clean shell" and its assets will consist only of the Company's corporate
franchise, its license to transact insurance pursuant to Chapter 17 of the Texas
Insurance Code, and certain other assets as contemplated herein and that the
Company shall have no liabilities that have not been provided for as
contemplated herein.

      WHEREAS, in connection with this Agreement, as of the Closing Date, Seller
is to take the actions provided for herein to (a) cause one hundred percent
(100%) of the Company's existing insurance liabilities and claims under the
GAINSCO Fronting Arrangement (as defined herein) to be reinsured; (b) provide
for the Company's remaining liabilities; and (c) reduce the Company's
policyholder surplus, all as contemplated herein.

      WHEREAS, with respect to certain insurance fronting programs between the
Company and (a) Metropolitan Property & Casualty Insurance Company
("METROPOLITAN") and (b) Omni Insurance Company ("OMNI") (together, the "THIRD
PARTY FRONTING ARRANGEMENTS"), Seller intends that the financial security
provided by Metropolitan and OMNI to the Company (the "FINANCIAL ASSURANCES")
will continue to be held by the Company unaffected by the Closing. The OMNI
fronting program was cancelled in accordance with the applicable contract terms,
statutes and regulations effective January 31, 2002. The Metropolitan fronting
program is continuing and is cancellable by the Company or Metropolitan upon due
notice.


                                       1
<PAGE>
      WHEREAS, each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that all
representations, warranties and covenants made by it herein have been made to
induce the other parties to enter into and perform this Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do
hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1
               TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

      1.1 AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AND SELL. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall, on the terms set
forth herein, acquire by transfer and assignment the Management Agreement from
Seller and Seller shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver all rights
and interests in and to the Management Agreement to Purchaser free and clear of
any and all liens, claims, options, charges, encumbrances, rights or
restrictions of any kind or nature, whether or not of record (hereinafter,
"LIENS").

      1.2 PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT. As consideration for the assignment of the
Management Agreement to Purchaser and the acquisition of control of the Company
by Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay and deliver to Seller the following payments
(collectively, the "PURCHASE PRICE"):

      (a) Closing Date Payment. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay Seller, in
immediately available funds, the sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00),
plus an additional amount equal to the surplus (as defined in Section 1.8(a))
shown on the Closing Pro Forma Balance Sheet (together, the "CLOSING DATE
PAYMENT"). Seller shall designate an account to which the Closing Date Payment
shall be made, and advise Purchaser of same, at least two (2) business days
prior to the Closing Date.

      (b) Additional Consideration. Subject to the conditions described below in
this Section 1.2(b), Purchaser shall pay to Seller an additional sum of Three
Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) on September 15, 2003 and an additional sum of
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) on each September 15th from 2004 through
2009 (the "POST CLOSING PAYMENTS," and each a "POST CLOSING PAYMENT"), unless,
however, the Texas Legislature has enacted legislation, or the Texas Department
of Insurance (the "TEXAS DEPARTMENT") has adopted regulations, prior to the
applicable date of payment that would have the effect of (x) materially and
adversely altering the rights or flexibility afforded at the Closing Date to the
Company as a Texas county mutual insurance company in relation to rate regulated
entities authorized to write automobile insurance in Texas, or (y) granting to
rate regulated entities authorized to write automobile insurance in Texas a
material portion of the rights or flexibility afforded at the Closing Date to
the Company as a Texas county mutual insurance company (any of the foregoing, a
"MATERIAL ADVERSE LEGAL Change"). Examples of a Material Adverse Legal Change
may include, but are not limited to: (i) materially and adversely reducing the
exemption currently afforded to the Company as a Texas county mutual insurance
company from the rate setting requirements generally applicable to rate
regulated entities authorized to write automobile insurance in Texas; (ii)
materially and adversely restricting the Company's ability as a Texas


                                       2
<PAGE>
county mutual insurance company to market to the preferred and standard market
segments; (iii) imposing materially adverse volume constraints on the amount of
business that can be written by the Company as a Texas county mutual insurance
company; or (iv) providing that rate regulated entities authorized to write
automobile insurance in Texas do not have to make benchmark rate and rating
manual filings set or required by the Texas Department. In the event that a
Material Adverse Legal Change occurs, the obligation of Purchaser to make Post
Closing Payments shall be suspended. If the Material Adverse Legal Change is
repealed, rescinded or vetoed by legislative, administrative or executive
action, or finally adjudicated to be invalid, within one (1) year of such
suspension, the obligation of Purchaser to make Post Closing Payments shall be
reinstated, beginning with the next scheduled Post Closing Payment and the dates
for the remaining Post Closing Payments shall be pushed back for a period
commensurate with the time that the obligation to make Post Closing Payments was
suspended but not more than one (1) year. The obligation of Purchaser to make
Post Closing Payments shall terminate, except as set forth in Section 1.2(c)
below, if such Material Adverse Legal Change is not repealed, rescinded or
vetoed by legislative, administrative or executive action, or finally
adjudicated to be invalid within such one (1) year period. Seller shall not be
obligated to refund any Post Closing Payments that have been paid.

      (c) Subsequent Sale. If at any time after the Closing and prior to the
September 15, 2009 Post Closing Payment, (i) any Post Closing Payment is not
made when scheduled on the basis that a Material Adverse Legal Change has
occurred and is continuing; (ii) beneficial ownership or control of the Company
has been, or is thereafter, transferred to an unaffiliated party (excluding any
change in ownership or control due to a de-mutualization, initial public
offering, corporate reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of the
assets or beneficial ownership of Liberty or its affiliates, which sale involves
four or more affiliated companies of Liberty (one of which is the Company), or
any comparable transaction); and (iii) the total consideration in excess of
policyholder surplus for the sale or transfer of the Company's "shell" together
with its license as a Texas county mutual insurance company is greater than the
total of payments previously made to Seller by Purchaser, then Purchaser shall
forthwith after receipt of consideration therefor, pay to Seller an amount equal
to the lesser of (y) the remainder of the Post Closing Payments minus
$1,500,000.00 or (z) the value of consideration received therefor, excluding the
policyholder surplus component, and minus $1,500,000.00. If the criteria
described in (ii) above are met, and the Company has in force business and/or
other assets that will remain with the Company after such transaction, the
purchase agreement shall assign a fair market value to the Company's "shell" and
license as a Texas county mutual insurance company. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, any rights of Seller with respect to such
subsequent sale shall terminate on September 15, 2009.

      (d) Surplus Debentures. Immediately after the Closing, Purchaser shall pay
into the surplus of the Company an amount in cash and other admissible assets
equal to Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00), in exchange for the issuance of a
surplus debenture note in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A,
duly executed and delivered by the Company in favor of Purchaser. The
outstanding principal and interest due under the Seller Debenture, as described
in Section 2.4 hereto, shall be repaid by the Company on or before the Closing,
to the extent allowed by its terms and applicable law, and the remainder of such
principal and interest, if any, shall be waived and/or forgiven by Seller. The
Seller Debenture shall be surrendered to the Company at Closing for
cancellation, along with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser


                                       3
<PAGE>
that any and all Liens encumbering the Seller Debenture have been released. The
only assets existing in the Company as of the Closing Date, and prior to the
contribution to surplus by Purchaser described above in this Section 1.2(d),
shall consist of (i) guaranty funds receivable or on deposit (calculated as the
net present value of the guaranty funds receivable or on deposit (after
deduction of any year 2002 amounts which are due to, or which could become
payable to, Metropolitan, OMNI or GAIC or any of its affiliates) using a 10%
discount rate and a 10-year life of the credits available); and (ii) premium
taxes receivable (the amount of which shall be net of any amounts which are due
to, or which could become payable to, Metropolitan, OMNI or GAIC or any of its
affiliates).

Exhibit B to the GAIC Reinsurance Agreement.

consistent with the format shown in Schedule 1.5, as of the Closing (the
"ADJUSTED BALANCE SHEET") which shall be prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with Statutory Accounting Practices and the principles used in the
preparation of the Closing Pro Forma Balance Sheet. If within thirty (30) days
following delivery of the Adjusted Balance Sheet, Purchaser has not given Seller
written notice of its objection thereto (which notice shall state the basis of
Purchaser's objection), then the Adjusted Balance Sheet shall be binding and
conclusive on the parties. In the event that the surplus of the Company as of
the Closing as shown in the Adjusted Balance Sheet is less than the surplus of
the Company as shown in the Closing Pro Forma Balance Sheet, Sellers shall,
within thirty (30) days of its delivery of the Adjusted Balance Sheet, pay such
shortfall to Purchaser. In the event that the surplus of the Company as of the
Closing Date as shown in the Adjusted Balance Sheet exceeds the surplus of the
Company as shown in the Closing Pro Forma Balance Sheet, Purchaser shall, within
thirty (30) days of Sellers' delivery of the Adjusted Balance Sheet (assuming
Purchaser has not objected thereto), pay such excess to Sellers. As used in this
section, "SURPLUS" in respect of the Company shall mean "surplus as regards
policyholders," calculated pursuant to page 3 of the NAIC Annual Statement
Blank.

      (b) In the event that Purchaser disagrees with the Adjusted Balance Sheet,
Purchaser shall provide notice of such disagreement and the nature or reason
therefor to Sellers no later than twenty (20) days (or the next business day
following such period) after the delivery to Purchaser of the Adjusted Balance
Sheet (the "DISPUTE NOTICE," and the date of its delivery, the "DISPUTE NOTICE
DATE"). Sellers and Purchaser shall use their best efforts to resolve such
disagreement by negotiation for five (5) business days following the Dispute
Notice Date, and if resolution is achieved, payment of any amount required
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) shall be made


                                       7
<PAGE>
by Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, within five (5) business days after
such resolution. In the event no resolution is reached within such period, the
dispute shall be jointly submitted by Purchaser and Sellers to the Dallas office
of a nationally recognized public accounting firm chosen by Sellers, and which
is reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser (the "ARBITER"), the next business day
following the expiration of such period. The Arbiter shall make its
determination of the dispute within fifteen (15) business days after submission
thereof, which determination shall be binding and conclusive on all of the
parties hereto. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate fully in
assisting the Arbiter, as it may require or request, to reach such determination
and shall take all actions necessary to expedite and to cause the Arbiter to
expedite such determination. Upon completion of the Arbiter's review, payment of
any amount required pursuant to Section 1.8(a) shall be made by Sellers or
Purchaser, as the case may be, within five (5) business days after such
determination. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the
total fees and expenses of the Arbiter.

      1.9 ACTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING. At the reasonable request of Purchaser
or Sellers, as applicable, after the Closing, and without further consideration,
Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, shall from time to time execute and deliver
or cause to be executed and delivered such further instruments of transfer,
releases of indebtedness or other liabilities, assignments, assumptions,
consents or documents as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out
the purposes hereof and will make available to the other such books and records
of the other as may be reasonably requested to carry out obligations created or
contemplated hereunder and to report the transactions hereunder to Governmental
Entities.

constitute a breach or default, or permit termination, modification or
suspension under such agreement (without limiting the foregoing, neither Seller
nor the Company are in breach or default of any provision of the Management
Agreement beyond any applicable grace period).

      (c) With the exception of the consents and approvals described in Sections
4.5 and 5.1 hereof, Seller may sell, assign, and transfer all of its rights and
interests under the Management Agreement without the approval of any persons,
including, without limitation, the policyholders of the Company. Upon the

Agreement.

to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to
obligations of Purchaser which are set forth in Article 6, and which are
dependent on the actions of Sellers or the Company, to be fulfilled.

      4.14 NOTICE AND CURE. Sellers will notify Purchaser promptly in writing
of, and contemporaneously will provide Purchaser with true and complete copies
of, any and all information or documents relating to, and will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing, any event,
transaction, or circumstance occurring after the date of this Agreement, that
causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Seller under this Agreement to
be breached, or that renders or will render untrue any representation or
warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement as if the same were made on or as
of the date of such event, transaction, or circumstance. Seller shall promptly
inform Purchaser in writing of any event or condition which has, or is
reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on the Company or the
Management Agreement.

      4.15 NEGOTIATIONS. Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is

consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction with the Company.

policyholder surplus in accordance with the Texas Insurance Code.

      4.17 RATINGS. Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in notifying rating
services of the proposed transaction. No communication to any such service with
regard to this transaction shall be made by one party without a good faith
effort to obtain prior approval from the other.

      4.18 CHARTER AND BYLAW AMENDMENTS. Following the execution of this
Agreement, Sellers shall cause to be called a meeting of the policyholders of
the Company for the purpose of


                                       27
<PAGE>
amending and restating the Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Restated
Bylaws of the Company. The Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Restated
Bylaws shall be amended and restated consistent with the forms attached hereto
as Exhibits I and J. In connection therewith, the Company shall cause all
applicable notices and disclosures to the policyholders of the Company
pertaining to such amendments to be prepared and distributed in accordance with
all applicable laws and regulations. Such notices shall contain the
recommendation of the board of directors of the Company to its policyholders in
favor of the proposed amendments. Upon receipt of such policyholder approval,
the Company shall promptly take all commercially reasonable action necessary to
secure the approval of the Texas Department; provided, however, the Sellers may
request that such approval be conditioned upon the approval by the Texas
Department of Purchaser's Form A Acquisition Statement. Completion of the
amendments contemplated herein may be conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Closing under this Agreement. In the event approvals from the Texas Department
and the policyholders are not received prior to Closing, Sellers hereby grant a
limited license to Purchaser and the Company to continue to use the name

      4.19 NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT. Sellers agree that, for the period

obligation to make Post Closing Payments terminates pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement, Sellers shall not acquire (i) control of a Texas county
mutual insurance company or (ii) greater than a 50% ownership interest in any
entity that writes nonstandard private passenger and/or commercial automobile
insurance in the State of Texas as a significant and material portion of its
business. The parties specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law
for breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that Purchaser, in addition
to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or
posting a bond. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the terms and conditions of
this Section 4.19 are reasonable, are supported by good and sufficient
consideration, and place reasonable restrictions in view of the facts and
circumstances. The agreement set forth in this Section 4.19 shall not apply (i)
to GAINSCO or any successor to GAINSCO, if GAINSCO is sold, consolidated or
merged with or into another entity or entities (except a consolidation or merger
into a subsidiary of GAINSCO, a merger in which GAINSCO is the surviving
corporation (and is not thereafter wholly owned by a previously unrelated
entity), or a transaction in which the holders of GAINSCO's voting securities
outstanding immediately prior to the transaction constitute a majority of the
holders of voting securities immediately following the transaction), or (ii) to
any of GAINSCO's affiliates, if no longer owned or controlled directly or
indirectly by GAINSCO.

reasonable efforts to file a Form A Acquisition Statement with the Texas

authorizations and approvals of appropriate Governmental Entities or other
persons required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by
Purchaser of this Agreement, and (ii) shall assist and cooperate with Sellers in
preparing and filing all documents required to be submitted by or on behalf of
Sellers to any Governmental Entity in connection with such transactions and in
obtaining any governmental or third party consents, waivers, authorizations or
approvals which may be required to be obtained by Sellers in connection with
such transactions.

      5.2 SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS. Purchaser agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to obligations of Sellers which are
set forth in Article 7, and which are dependent upon the actions of Purchaser,
to be fulfilled.

      5.3 ACCESS TO RECORDS. After the Closing, Purchaser will afford Seller and
its employees, agents, counselors and advisors reasonable access to the
Company's books, records and data pertaining to pre-Closing activities for the
purpose of preparing any Statutory Insurance Statements or Tax Returns of the
Company due for periods prior to the Closing Date.

      5.4 USE OF NAMES AND MARKS. Purchaser specifically agrees that from and
after the Closing Date, or upon the approval of a new name for the Company, if
later, neither Purchaser nor the Company will make use of the word "GAINSCO" or
any name, mark or term confusingly similar therewith, except for purposes of
historical identification of any products sold by the Company prior to the
Closing Date and as may be necessary for regulatory reporting requirements.

Accounting Practices, with the assets determined in accordance with the
requirements of Section 1.2(d), and certified by the Company's treasurer, to the
best of his knowledge, as true, accurate and complete. The Closing Pro Forma

                                   ARTICLE 8
                            SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

      8.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, ETC. Except as specified

upon by the party receiving the same and shall survive the Closing for a period
of five (5) years regardless of any investigation by or knowledge of such party
and shall not merge into the performance of any obligation by any party hereto;
provided, however, if at any time prior to September 15, 2005, a Material
Adverse Legal Change occurs that is not subsequently repealed, rescinded or
vetoed within one (1) year, all representations, warranties, agreements,
covenants and obligations shall survive the Closing for a period of three (3)
years; provided further, however, that any and all of the representations,
warranties, agreements, covenants and obligations of the parties contained in
Sections 1.3(a), 2.2, 2.3(a), 2.18(a), 2.32, 5.3, 5.4 and 6.10 shall survive the

Closing for a period of time consistent with the time periods described therein.
The indemnification rights and obligations of the parties set forth in this

      8.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLERS. Sellers jointly and severally agree,
subsequent to the Closing Date, to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser,
its affiliates, its subsidiaries (including the Company after the Closing) and
all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns (individually, a "PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively, the
"PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and against and in respect of all losses,
claims, causes of action, liabilities, obligations, damages, Taxes,
deficiencies, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, orders,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees,
disbursements and expenses of attorneys, accountants and consultants) of any
kind or nature whatsoever (whether or not arising out of third-party claims and
including all amounts paid in investigation, defense and settlement of the
foregoing) (subject


                                       33
<PAGE>
to the provisions of Section 8.8, a "LOSS" or "LOSSES") sustained, suffered or
incurred by or made against any Purchaser Indemnified Party arising out of,
based upon or in connection with:

      (a) conditions, circumstances or occurrences which constitute or result in
any breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers and/or the Company
in this Agreement or in any certificate, agreement, document or other instrument
delivered under or in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any claim,
action or proceeding asserted or instituted arising out of or resulting from an
inaccuracy in any such representations or warranties;

      (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Sellers and/or the
Company in this Agreement or in any certificate, agreement, document or other
instrument delivered under or in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of
any claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted arising out of or
resulting from the breach of any such covenant or agreement;

      (c) liabilities relating to amounts due in connections with any Employee
Benefit Plan under which the Company may incur liability for Pre-Closing
Periods;

      (d) any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to or otherwise
attributable to the Company with respect to periods, or portions thereof,
including but not limited to Taxes allocated to the Company pursuant to any tax
allocation agreement between the Company and any other person, ending on or
before the Closing Date ("PRE-CLOSING PERIODS");

      (e) any and all liabilities or obligations of any kind or nature of the
Company, known or unknown, accrued, contingent or otherwise, to the extent they
relate to or to the extent they result from conditions or circumstances arising
or events occurring before the Closing, but excluding in any event (i) any
liabilities or obligations relating to the Third Party Fronting Arrangements or
the GAINSCO Fronting Arrangement (which for the latter is covered by the GAIC
Reinsurance Agreement and Section 8.2(g) hereof), and (ii) the portion of any
Loss that is caused by the wrongful or negligent actions or inactions of any of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties taken after the Closing Date;

      (f) any and all insurance claims, liabilities and obligations of the
Company, if any, that are not reinsured pursuant to the GAIC Reinsurance
Agreement or the Third Party Fronting Arrangements; and

      (g) any and all insurance claims, liabilities and obligations of GAIC
under the GAIC Reinsurance Agreement, in the event (i) GAIC fails to timely
perform its obligations, covenants and agreements as required under the terms of
the GAIC Reinsurance Agreement, or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction or
Governmental Entity shall have declared or found GAIC to be insolvent, or places
GAIC in supervision, conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation; provided,
however, with respect to the event described in (g)(i) above, if the parties to
the GAIC Reinsurance Agreement have a disagreement with respect to any amount
that is owed by GAIC to the Company thereunder and such dispute is subject to
the arbitration provisions of the GAIC Reinsurance Agreement, Sellers shall not
be required to satisfy their indemnification obligations set forth above under
(g)(i) until the decision in the arbitration proceeding has become final and
GAIC has had a reasonable period of time (not to exceed seven (7) business days)
to pay any amount owed to the Company pursuant thereto.


                                       34
<PAGE>
      Provided, however, that Sellers' obligations to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless as provided in Sections 8.2(a) through (e) (but excluding (f) and
(g))shall not apply until the cumulative amount of all Losses to Purchaser
Indemnified Parties exceeds $50,000.00, whereupon Sellers shall be responsible
for the full amount of all Losses including the first $50,000.00; and provided,
further, that the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is sought shall
be net of any amount actually recovered with respect thereto by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Parties under insurance policies and that the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Parties shall have attempted in good faith to recover any
Losses that are so insured.

      8.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER. Purchaser agrees, subsequent to the
Closing Date, to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, their affiliates, their
subsidiaries and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from and
against and in respect of all Losses sustained, suffered or incurred by or made
against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of, based upon or in
connection with (a) conditions, circumstances or occurrences which constitute or
result in any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this
Agreement or in any certificate, agreement, document or other instrument
delivered under or in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any claim,
action or proceeding asserted or instituted arising out of or relating to any
inaccuracy in such representations or warranties; (b) any breach of any covenant
or agreement made by Purchaser in this Agreement or in any certificate,
agreement, document or other instrument delivered under or in connection with
this Agreement, or by reason of any claim, action or proceeding asserted or
instituted arising out of or relating to a breach of any such covenant or
agreement; (c) any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to or otherwise
attributable to the Company with respect to periods, or portions thereof,
including but not limited to Taxes allocated to the Company pursuant to any tax
allocation agreement between the Company and any other person, beginning after
the Closing Date; and (d) any and all liabilities or obligations of any kind or
nature of the Company, known or unknown, accrued, contingent or otherwise, to
the extent they relate to or to the extent they result from conditions or
circumstances arising or events occurring after the Closing, but excluding in
any event (i) any liabilities or obligations relating to the GAINSCO Fronting
Arrangement, and (ii) the portion of any Loss that is caused by the wrongful or
negligent actions or inactions of any of the Seller Indemnified Parties.

      8.4 NOTICE; DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

      (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of any Loss
to which the indemnification obligations hereunder would apply, the indemnified
party shall give notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party (the
Purchaser with respect to claims by the Seller Indemnified Parties and Sellers
with respect to claims by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties), but the omission
to so notify the indemnifying party promptly will not relieve the indemnifying
party from any liability except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall
have been prejudiced as a result of the failure or delay in giving such notice.
Such notice shall state the information then available regarding the amount and
nature of such Loss and shall specify the provision or provisions of this
Agreement under which the liability or obligation is asserted.

      (b) In the event an indemnification claim relates to any suit, action, or
proceeding brought by any third party against an indemnified party, if within
twenty (20) days after


                                       35
<PAGE>
receiving such notice, the indemnifying party gives written notice to the
indemnified party stating that the indemnifying party (i) would be liable under
the provisions hereof for indemnity in the amount of such claim if such claim
were successful, (ii) shall be fully responsible (with no reservation of any
rights) for all liabilities relating to such Loss and that it will provide full
indemnification (whether otherwise required hereunder) to the indemnified party
with respect to such Loss, and (iii) disputes the third party claim and intends
to defend against Loss at its own cost and expense, then counsel for the defense
shall be selected by the indemnifying party (subject to the consent of the
indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the
indemnifying party shall not be required to make any payment to the indemnified
party with respect to such Loss if and so long as the indemnifying party is
conducting a good faith and diligent defense at its own expense; provided,
however, that the assumption of defense of any such matters by the indemnifying
party shall relate solely to the claim, liability or expense that is subject or
potentially subject to indemnification, and provided further that prior to such
assumption of defense the indemnifying party shall enter into an agreement with
the indemnified party in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party pursuant to which the indemnifying party unconditionally
guarantees the payment and performance of any liability or obligation which may
arise out of or in any way relating to such Loss or the facts giving rise
thereto. The indemnifying party shall have the right, with the consent of the
indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to settle
all indemnifiable matters related to claims by third parties which are
susceptible to being settled, provided its obligation to indemnify the
indemnifying party therefor will be fully satisfied. The indemnifying party
shall keep the indemnified party apprised of the status of the Loss and any
resulting suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish the indemnified
party with all documents and information that the indemnified party shall
reasonably request and shall consult with the indemnified party prior to acting
on major matters, including settlement discussions. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 8.4 (b) to the contrary, the indemnified party shall at all times
have the right to fully participate in such defense at its own expense directly
or through counsel; provided, however, if the named parties to the action or
proceeding include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
representation of both parties by the same counsel or of the indemnified party
by counsel representing the indemnifying party would be inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct, the expense of separate counsel
for the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying party and the rights
of the indemnifying party to control the defense and settle the claims shall not
apply.

      (c) If no notice of intent to dispute and defend is given by the
indemnifying party as provided in Section 8.4(b), or if such diligent good faith
defense is not being or ceases to be conducted, the indemnified party shall have
the right, at the expense of the indemnifying party, to undertake the defense of
(with counsel selected by the indemnified party), and shall have the right to
compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) such Losses
applicable to either party. If such Loss is one that by its nature cannot be
defended solely by the indemnifying party or otherwise at the reasonable request
of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall make available all
information and assistance that the indemnifying party may reasonably request
and shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in such defense.

      (d) The requirements of Sections 8.4(a), (b) and (c) shall not apply to
the indemnification obligations under Section 8.2(g).


                                       36
<PAGE>
      8.5 RECOVERIES. The amount of any Losses suffered, sustained, incurred or
required to be paid by any indemnifying party shall be reduced by the amount of
any insurance proceeds paid to the indemnified party by any person not a party
to this Agreement.

      8.6 SATISFACTION OF INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. Except as provided in
Section 8.4(b) hereof, any indemnity payable pursuant to this Article 8 shall be
paid within twenty (20) business days after the indemnified party's written
request therefor accompanied by reasonably satisfactory documentation supporting
the claim for indemnification, including the amount of Losses and the
calculation of and justification therefor; provided, however, any indemnity
payable pursuant to Section 8.2(g)(i) shall be paid within seven (7) business
days after the decision in the arbitration proceeding referred to therein, if
any, has become final, or if there is no arbitration proceeding initiated
thereunder, then payment will be made upon three (3) business days to notice to
Sellers. Purchaser shall be entitled to offset any indemnity payable to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article 8 against any of the Post
Closing Payments owed by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of this Agreement;
provided, however, with respect to such right of offset, (a) the amount of any
indemnity payable must be based upon a good faith estimate by Purchaser of the
Losses to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, and supported by reasonably
satisfactory documentation; (b) if it is determined through a judicial or
arbitration proceeding (and such determination has become final) that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties were ultimately entitled to an amount under
Section 8.2 that was less than the amount Purchaser offset against the Post
Closing Payment(s) pursuant to this section, Sellers shall be entitled to
recover from Purchaser, within seven (7) business days from the date of the
determination, both the difference between the two amounts and interest on the
difference between the two amounts at twelve percent (12%) per annum, subject to
the maximum rate of interest allowed by law, which interest shall accrue from
the date Purchaser exercised its right of offset until the date reimbursement is
made to Sellers (and such interest shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to,
interest awarded pursuant to the judicial or arbitration proceeding); and (c)
unless either of Sellers is insolvent or the subject of bankruptcy or
receivership proceedings, any amounts which Purchaser seeks to offset against
the Post Closing Payment(s) for claims for Losses asserted by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, which
amounts are disputed in good faith by Sellers, shall be deposited into an escrow
account pursuant to an escrow agreement, in all material respects in form
attached hereto as Exhibit O, and with an independent escrow agent selected by
Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to Sellers, and released to the appropriate
party upon final resolution of the dispute. The requirements under (a), (b) and
(c) above shall not apply to any indemnity owed to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under Section 8.2(g)(i), and Purchaser may exercise its right of offset
with respect to all Losses under Section 8.2(g)(i) without complying with such
requirements. Any subsequent reimbursement to Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.5
hereof shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

      8.7 SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Following the Closing, recourse under the
provisions of this Article 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any party
to this Agreement for Losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or
incurred by such party, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from
any breach by any other party of any of such other party's representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant hereto, but excluding
claims related to fraud and claims for injunctive or other equitable relief for
which monetary damages covered by


                                       37
<PAGE>
an indemnity obligation set forth herein are not available. The foregoing
limitation does not foreclose or otherwise limit the rights and remedies of the
parties to the Liability Assumption Agreement or the GAIC Reinsurance Agreement.

      8.8 EXCLUSIONS FROM LOSSES. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"LOSSES" shall have the meaning assigned to it in Section 8.2; provided,
however, with respect to indemnification under this Article 8, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall have any
liability for, and the definition of Losses explicitly excludes, any amounts
that are claimed by any indemnified party arising from, relating to, or
including, in whole or in part, any consequential, special, incidental, or
punitive damages, whether awarded by a court or an arbitrator. The foregoing
exclusion does not apply to amounts paid or owed by an indemnified party with
respect to any claim, suit, action or proceeding brought by any third party.

                                   ARTICLE 9
                                     TAXES

      9.1 COOPERATION AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. The Company and its
affiliates will not, unless otherwise required by law, rule or regulation or
unless doing so would have no effect on any Taxes for which Sellers are or may
be liable under Sections 8.2(d), 9.5 and 9.9 hereof, adopt a Tax treatment of
any material item that is inconsistent with the past treatment of similar items
of the Company in any previously filed Tax Return. Sellers and Purchaser will
provide, or cause to be provided, to each other prompt notice of and copies of
all correspondence received from any taxing authority by Sellers or Purchaser in
connection with any liability for Losses relating to Taxes for which the other
party is or may be liable under Sections 8.2(d), 9.5 and 9.9 hereof. The parties
will provide each other with the cooperation and information as they may
reasonably request of each other in preparing or filing any Return, amended
Return, or claim for refund, in determining a liability or a right to refund or
in conducting any audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding in
respect of Taxes imposed on the parties, the Company or their respective
affiliates, or for which a party may be required to indemnify another party
pursuant to this Agreement. Sellers shall have the right to participate in the
conduct of any Tax audit, assessment or proceeding with respect to Taxes
attributable solely to any Pre-Closing Period at their own expense and with
their own counsel; Purchaser shall agree to any reasonable settlement thereof
recommended by Sellers. If the effect of such settlement would be to increase
the liability of Purchaser or the Company for any post-Closing period, Sellers
agree to pay to Purchaser the full amount of any such increase.

      9.2 SELLERS' ACCESS. Purchaser will grant or cause to be granted to
Sellers access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books and
records relating to the Company within its possession or control (including,
without limitation, Tax work papers, Tax Returns and correspondence with Tax
authorities), including the right to take extracts therefrom and make copies
thereof at Sellers' expense, to the extent reasonably necessary in connection
with Taxes and Tax disputes to which this Agreement applies and shall furnish
the assistance and cooperation of such personnel and affiliates of Purchaser as
Sellers may reasonably request in connection therewith.


                                       38
<PAGE>
      9.3 PURCHASER'S ACCESS. Sellers will grant or cause to be granted to
Purchaser, the Company or their representatives access at all reasonable times
to all of the information, books and records relating to the Company within
Sellers' possession or control (including, without limitation, Tax work papers,
Tax Returns and correspondence with Tax authorities), including the right to
take extracts therefrom and make copies thereof at the expense of the Company,
to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes and Tax disputes to
which this Agreement applies and shall furnish the assistance and cooperation of
such personnel and affiliates of Sellers as Purchaser may reasonably request in
connection therewith.

      9.4 CONFIDENTIALITY. Any information obtained by a party hereto or its
affiliates from another party hereto or its affiliates in connection with any
Tax matters to which this Agreement applies shall be kept confidential, except
as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

      9.5 PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS. Sellers shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns, including premium
Tax Returns, for the Company that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall
permit Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by Purchaser. Sellers shall be liable for and shall
reimburse Purchaser for all Taxes of the Company with respect to all Pre-Closing
Periods, within fifteen (15) days after payment by Purchaser or the Company of
such Taxes. To the extent a short-period Tax Return is not required for the
period from January 1, 2002 through the Closing Date, Sellers shall be
responsible for the portion of such Taxes allocable to the period prior to
Closing and shall reimburse Purchaser with respect to such Taxes. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns, including premium Tax Returns, for
the Company that are required to be filed after the Closing Date for all periods
ending after the Closing Date.

      9.6 ALLOCATION BETWEEN PERIODS. All Taxes shall be determined on the basis
of an interim closing of the books of the Company as though its Tax year ended
on the Closing Date; provided, that the allocable portion of any periodic Tax
that is not based on income, receipts or transactions shall be determined by
apportioning the Tax for the entire taxable year based upon the number of days
in the Pre-Closing Period and post-Closing period. The books and records of the
Company shall be closed at the end of business on the Closing Date, and for
purposes of this Agreement, a short Tax-year period shall end for the period
January 1, 2002 through the Closing Date. Sellers shall prepare or cause to be
prepared, and shall execute on behalf of the Company and file or cause to be
filed in a timely manner all federal Tax Returns for the Company for all periods
ending on the Closing Date.

      9.7 TAX TREATMENT OF TRANSACTIONS. Sellers and Purchasers agree that for
Tax purposes the transfer of the rights and interests in the Management
Agreement is a sale by Sellers of all of their interests in the Management
Agreement. Except pursuant to any judicial proceeding that has become final,
Sellers and Purchaser agree not to take any position inconsistent with this
position for Tax purposes.


                                       39
<PAGE>
      9.8 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. The parties agree that the consideration
payable pursuant to Article 1 relates to an applicable asset acquisition as
defined in Treas. Reg. 1.1060-1(b) and shall be allocated in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the underlying Treasury Regulations entirely to the
Management Agreement. Each party agrees to file with its federal income Tax
Returns an initial asset acquisition statement and any supplemental statements
on IRS Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement), consistent with the preceding
sentence.

      9.9 TRANSFER TAXES. Sellers shall pay the cost of any and all sales, use,
transfer or other similar Taxes imposed as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Purchaser and the Company shall
have no obligation or liability of any kind to Sellers with respect to such
Taxes.

      9.10 TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. All tax sharing or indemnification agreements
and all power of attorney arrangements, or any similar agreements of any kind
involving the Company, shall be terminated on or before the Closing, and all
payment obligations thereunder shall be paid, settled, and satisfied prior to
the Closing.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

      10.1 METHODS OF TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

      (a) by the mutual written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;

      (b) by Purchaser, if all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 of this
Agreement shall not have been satisfied or waived within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the date hereof;

      (c) by Sellers, if all of the conditions set forth in Article 7 of this

thereof from Seller;

      (f) if a court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which order, decree

the parties hereto with reference to the transactions set forth herein, and no
representations, warranties or covenants have been made in connection with this
Agreement, either express or implied, other than those expressly set forth
herein, in the Schedules or Exhibits hereto or in the certificates, agreements
and other documents delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement supersedes all prior negotiations, discussions,
correspondence, communications, understandings and agreements between the
parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and all prior drafts of
this Agreement, all of which are merged into this Agreement; provided, however,
the parties hereto shall remain subject to and bound by that certain
Confidentiality Agreement dated April 8, 2002 between GAINSCO and Liberty, in
accordance with its terms, until the Closing hereunder, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate in its entirety, with the exception of
the provisions in Sections 4 and 8 thereof which shall survive the Closing for
the periods of time indicated therein.

      11.7 WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES. This Agreement may be amended,
superseded, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a
written instrument signed by each of the parties hereto or, in the case of a
waiver, by the party(ies) waiving compliance. No delay on the part of any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such right, power
or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
such right, power or privilege.

      11.8 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
unlawful, invalid, or unenforceable by any court or administrative agency, it
shall be deemed severable and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and be interpreted so as to carry out the intent of the
parties in an equitable manner, unless severance of the provision held unlawful,
invalid or unenforceable would substantially impair the benefits to the parties
of the remaining portions of this Agreement.

together shall be considered one and the same agreement.

      11.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is made under and shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard

      11.12 EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES. The Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto
are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references herein
to Articles, Sections, clauses, Exhibits and Schedules shall be deemed
references to such parts of this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise
require. Disclosure of any matter in any Schedule or Exhibit, as the case may

parties hereto. The language used in this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated herein shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to

      Liberty hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the performance
of all of Purchaser's obligations hereunder, subject to any defenses available
to Purchaser under this Agreement. If any of such obligations of Purchaser are
not complied with in any material respect whatsoever, and without the necessity
of any notice from either of Sellers to Liberty, Liberty agrees to timely
perform such obligations. Sellers each will have the right to proceed directly
against Liberty without first exhausting any other remedy it may have against
Purchaser.

                                SURPLUS DEBENTURE


$10,000,000                                                    ___________, 2002


NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY PROVISION HEREIN, IT IS AGREED AND UNDERSTOOD THAT
THE OBLIGATION TO PAY EITHER INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL UNDER THIS SURPLUS DEBENTURE
IS CONTINGENT UPON LIBERTY MUTUAL COUNTY INSURANCE COMPANY HAVING POLICYHOLDER
SURPLUS IN THE AMOUNT HEREIN SPECIFIED. IN THE EVENT THAT SAID COMPANY DOES NOT
HAVE THE REQUISITE POLICYHOLDER SURPLUS ON THE MATURITY DATE OF THIS SURPLUS
DEBENTURE OR ANY OTHER DATE PRESCRIBED FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST,
THE DEBT, EITHER AS TO PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST, SHALL NOT BE DISCHARGED, BUT SHALL
BE DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH DATE THAT POLICYHOLDER SURPLUS EXISTS IN THE REQUISITE
AMOUNT.

1.    For value received, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Liberty
      Mutual County Insurance Company of Dallas County, Texas (the "Company"),
      subject to all of the terms and contingencies set out herein, promises to
      pay to the order of Berkeley Management Corporation, a Texas corporation
      (the "Holder"), its successors and assigns, the sum of _________ Million
      and No/100 Dollars ($___________________) (or the balance of the principal
      sum from time to time advanced and remaining unpaid) together with
      interest at 10% per annum; provided, however, that the interest rate as
      calculated hereunder shall never exceed the maximum rate of interest which
      could be lawfully charged to the Company under the applicable laws of the
      State of Texas or of the United States of America then in effect and as
      construed by the courts having jurisdiction thereof. Interest shall be
      computed on a per annum basis of a year of 365 days and for the actual
      number of days (including the first but excluding the last day) elapsed.

2.    This Surplus Debenture is a draw note on which the Company may draw in
      accordance with the following terms and conditions:

            (a) From and after the date of this Surplus Debenture, the Holder
            may advance up to Ten Million and No/100 Dollars ($10,000,000) to
            the Company hereunder.

            (b) The initial advance under this Surplus Debenture shall be the
            sum of Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) (the "Initial
            Advance") and shall be funded as of ___________, 2002.

            (c) If no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing,
            the Company shall be entitled to draw down, upon thirty (30) days
            prior written notice to the Holder, one or more additional advances
            of not less than Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000)
            each; provided, however, that in no event shall all of such
            additional advances, when taken together with the Initial Advance,
            exceed


                                       1
<PAGE>
            the aggregate principal sum of ____________ Million
            _________________ and No/100 Dollars ($___________________).

            (d) The Holder is hereby authorized by the Company to endorse on
            Schedule "A" (or a continuation thereof) attached to this Surplus
            Debenture, the amount and date of any advance that shall be made by
            the Holder hereunder, and the amount and date of each payment of
            principal or interest that shall be received by the Holder
            hereunder, provided that any failure by the Holder to make any such
            endorsement shall not affect the rights of the Holder or the
            obligations of the Company under this Surplus Debenture.

3.    The principal and interest of this Surplus Debenture shall be payable only
      out of policyholder surplus of the Company in excess of the minimum
      surplus floor defined below. For purposes of this Surplus Debenture,
      policyholder surplus shall be defined as all assets of the Company
      remaining after deduction of all liabilities, in accordance with the
      accounting procedures applicable to the Company under the laws of the
      State of Texas, and which is reported as its total policyholder surplus in
      its annual statement filed with the Texas Department of Insurance, and
      currently entered on line 32 of page 3 of the annual statement form. The
      minimum surplus floor, as referred to in this Surplus Debenture, shall be
      $2,000,000.00.

4.    Subject to the restrictions in paragraph 2 above, the principal of this
      Surplus Debenture shall be due and payable on demand, but if no demand be
      sooner made, all principal and accrued interest then remaining unpaid
      shall be due and payable on or before January 3, 2046, unless an extension
      is granted by the Holder in its sole discretion. In the event that the
      Company is not possessed, at the time when payments of either principal or
      interest are due hereunder, of the requisite policyholder surplus from
      which to make such payments in accordance with the terms hereof, such
      payments shall be deferred but not extinguished. If the policyholder
      surplus is not sufficient to discharge all of the obligations as to both
      principal and interest, partial payments shall be made to the extent that
      the requisite policyholder surplus does exist, with each such payment to
      be applied first to accrued and unpaid interest, and the balance, if any,
      to principal.

5.    This Surplus Debenture shall bear interest as provided herein to be
      calculated from the date of issuance until paid. Interest, computed on the
      unpaid principal balance of this Surplus Debenture, shall be due and
      payable in quarterly installments, as it accrues, on the first day of each
      calendar quarter commencing October 1, 2002.

6.    No payment shall be made on this Surplus Debenture as to principal or
      interest which shall reduce the policyholder surplus of the Company as
      herein provided, at the time of payment, below the surplus requirements
      set forth in Article 2.20 of the Texas Insurance Code. The Company
      reserves the right to prepay this Surplus Debenture in whole or in part at
      any time without penalty, but no payment shall be made except from
      policyholder surplus in excess of the minimum surplus floor stated herein.

7.    This Surplus Debenture represents and evidences a loan to the Company by
      the Holder of such funds as are necessary for the purposes of its business
      and further to enable the


                                       2
<PAGE>
      Company to comply with the surplus requirements of the Texas Insurance
      Code. Pursuant to Article 17.17 of the Texas Insurance Code, this Surplus
      Debenture represents and evidences an advance to the Company by the
      Holder, a policyholder of the Company, of such funds as are necessary for
      the purposes of its business and further to enable the Company to comply
      with the surplus requirements of Articles 2.20 and 17.11 of the Texas
      Insurance Code.

8.    This Surplus Debenture is and shall be binding upon the successors and
      assigns of the Company to the extent herein stated; provided, however,
      this Surplus Debenture shall not create a lien upon or claim against any
      reserves or premiums due in respect of those insurance policies of the
      Company which are reinsured, or the liability of which is assumed, by
      another insurer pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of the
      Company. In the event of any liquidation, receivership, or winding up,
      which is involuntary in nature, this Surplus Debenture shall be
      subordinate and inferior to the rights attributable to the insurance
      policies of the Company; but otherwise, such Surplus Debenture shall be
      prior and superior in entitlement to distribution of assets remaining
      after reinsurance, transfer, or extinguishment of obligations under
      insurance policies and payment of expenses of liquidation or sale, whether
      such distribution be pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary liquidation.
      In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation of the Company,
      the obligations of this Surplus Debenture shall become a fully matured
      liability of the Company, as to both principal and interest.

9.    It is understood that this Surplus Debenture, including principal and
      interest, shall not be a liability of the Company or a claim against any
      of its assets except as to the excess of its policyholder surplus over and
      above the minimum surplus floor as herein specified. Furthermore, it shall
      be reflected as a balance sheet liability only to the extent of any amount
      of principal and interest which is due and payable but unpaid. In the
      event of a consolidation or merger of the Company in a manner such that it
      is not the surviving company, this Surplus Debenture shall be and become
      the obligation of the surviving company to the full extent of the
      principal and interest owing hereunder.

10.   The Company further obligates itself, so long as any sums remain unpaid on
      this Surplus Debenture, to conduct its affairs in accordance with
      applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those embodied in the
      Texas Insurance Code and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant
      thereto.

11.   This Surplus Debenture is a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
      enforceable in accordance with its terms. The execution, delivery and
      performance of this Surplus Debenture has been duly authorized by all
      necessary action, corporate and otherwise, and will not violate or
      constitute a default under any law, requirement or restriction imposed
      upon the Company, or any judicial, arbitral or governmental
      instrumentality, the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or
      any agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it
      or its property may be bound or affected.

12.   The Company has not offered this Surplus Debenture or any part hereof for
      sale to, or solicited any offers to buy this Surplus Debenture or any part
      hereof from anyone other than the Holder. The Holder shall not sell or
      offer for sale this Surplus Debenture or any


                                       3
<PAGE>
      part hereof, or solicit any offer to buy this Surplus Debenture or any
      part hereof, or any similar obligation or similar security of the Company
      from any person or persons so as to bring the issuance or sale of this
      Surplus Debenture within the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act
      of 1933, as amended.

13.   No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, or the
      interest on, this Surplus Debenture, or for any claims based hereon or
      otherwise in respect hereof, against any past, present, or future member,
      officer, or director of the Company, such liability being, by acceptance
      and as a part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly
      released.

14.   No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Surplus
      Debenture, nor consent to any departure by the Company therefrom, shall be
      effective unless the same shall be in writing, signed by a duly authorized
      representative of the Company and the Holder, and then only in the
      specific instance and for the purpose for which it is given.

15.   The substantive laws of the State of Texas shall govern the validity,
      construction, enforcement, and interpretation of the provisions of this
      Surplus Debenture. Wherever possible, each provision of this Surplus
      Debenture shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and
      valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Surplus Debenture
      shall be prohibited or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall
      be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition and/or validity without
      invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions
      of this Surplus Debenture.

16.   This Surplus Debenture shall be binding upon the Company and the Holder
      and their respective legal representatives, successors, and permitted
      assigns. The Holder may not assign this Surplus Debenture or any of its
      rights hereunder without the express prior written consent of the Company.

17.   This Surplus Debenture is performable in Irving, Dallas County, Texas. The
      venue for any action relating to this Surplus Debenture shall be proper
      only in Dallas County, Texas.

18.   This Surplus Debenture has been approved by the Commissioner of Insurance
      of Texas pursuant to Article 1.39 and Article 21.49-1, Section 4(d)(1) of
      the Texas Insurance Code.

19.   In the event this Surplus Debenture is placed in the hands of an attorney
      for collection, or if the Holder incurs any costs incident to the
      collection of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, the Company agrees to pay
      to the Holder an amount equal to all such costs, including without
      limitation, all actual reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and all
      court costs.

20.   All agreements between the Company and the Holder hereof, whether now
      existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby
      expressly limited so that in no event, whether by reason of acceleration
      of the payment obligations hereunder or otherwise, shall the amount paid
      or agreed to be paid to the Holder hereof for the use, forbearance, or
      detention of money hereunder or otherwise exceed the maximum amount


                                       4
<PAGE>
      permissible under applicable law. If fulfillment of any provision hereof,
      at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve
      transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law, then, ipso facto,
      the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such
      validity; and if the Holder hereof shall ever receive anything of value
      deemed interest under applicable law which would exceed interest at the
      highest lawful rate, an amount equal to any excessive interest shall be
      applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing hereunder and not
      to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the
      unpaid balance of principal hereof, such excess shall be refunded to the
      Company. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Holder hereof for the
      use, forbearance, or detention of the indebtedness of the Company to the
      Holder hereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
      amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full term of
      such indebtedness until payment in full so that interest on the account of
      such indebtedness is uniform throughout the term thereof.

21.   To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, for itself
      and its successors and assigns, expressly waives presentment, protest,
      notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of demand, and nonpayment
      thereof, and the benefit of any exemption or insolvency laws.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Surplus Debenture is executed by the officers of

It is understood that the Company, the Reinsurer and the General Agent
(hereinafter identified collectively as the "Parties") wish to enter into a
reinsurance arrangement through which the Company is to bear no business, credit
or insurance risk whatsoever with respect to any and all Policies reinsured
hereunder. The Reinsurer shall hold the Company harmless and indemnify it for
these and all risks with respect to the business reinsured hereunder. The sole
consideration provided by the Company, in exchange for the fees as agreed to, is
to permit the Policies which are reinsured 100% under this Agreement to be
issued in the name of the Company. All provisions of this Agreement shall be
interpreted so as to be in accordance with this Preamble.

                                    ARTICLE I

Business, and the Post-Effective Date Business (collectively, the "Policies").

1.02 The General Agent shall have no authority to solicit new business on behalf
of the Company. The General Agent's authority to issue insurance in the
Company's name or to otherwise bind the Company is limited solely to offers to
renew and/or renewal of the In Force Business where such offer to renew and/or
renewal is required by state law or regulation. Subject to the requirements
imposed by law, all such renewals shall be further subject to terms and limits
of liability that are no greater than, and deductibles that are no less than, as
provided in each Policy that is in force as of the Effective Date.

renewal or extension (whether before or after termination of this Agreement)
required by statute or by rule or regulation of the Texas Department of
Insurance, or other authority having competent jurisdiction, with respect to any
Policy ceded hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                   EXCLUSIONS

insurance coverage with respect to any risk not specifically described as
business covered under Sections 1.01 and 1.02 of this Agreement.

                            COMMENCEMENT OF LIABILITY

with that of the Company as soon as the Company becomes liable, and the premium
on account of such liability shall be credited to the Reinsurer from the
original date of the Company's liability.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                      REINSURANCE FOLLOWS PRIMARY POLICIES

All reinsurance for which the Reinsurer shall be liable, by virtue of this
Agreement, shall be subject, in all respects, to the same rates, terms,
conditions, interpretations, waivers, the exact proportion of premiums paid to
the Company without any deduction for brokerage, and to the same modifications,
alterations and cancellations, as the respective insurance of the Company to
which such reinsurance relates. The intent of this Agreement is that the
Reinsurer shall, in every case to which this Agreement applies and in the
proportion specified herein, follow the fortunes of the Company.

      Reinsurer all payments of premiums due hereunder, provided, however, that
      in the event such payment is received by the Reinsurer prior to the date
      of cancellation stated in the Reinsurer's written notice this Agreement
      shall not be so terminated and said written notice shall be of no further
      force or effect;

      (e) Immediately, upon written notice by the Company, if the Reinsurer or
      General Agent is found to be insolvent by a state insurance department or
      court of competent jurisdiction, or is placed in supervision,
      conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation, or has a receiver or
      supervisor appointed;


                                       3

      (f) By the Reinsurer, upon thirty (30) days written notice, if the Company
      or General Agent is found to be insolvent by a state insurance department
      or court of competent jurisdiction, or is placed in supervision,
      conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation, or has a receiver or
      supervisor appointed;

      (g) By the Company, upon ten (10) days prior written notice, should the
      Texas Department of Insurance require cancellation or disallow credit for
      this reinsurance; or

      (h) After thirty (30) days written notice by the Company in the event that
      there is a change of control, sale, transfer, merger or consolidation
      involving the Reinsurer with an insurance company or insurance group that
      has an A.M. Best Company rating that is not "A-" or higher, or if the
      performance of, or liability for, any obligation hereunder is to be
      assumed by an insurance company that has an A.M. Best Company rating that
      is not "A-" or higher.

5.03 When this Agreement terminates for any reason, reinsurance hereunder shall
continue to apply to the business in force at the time and date of termination
until expiration or cancellation of such business. It is understood that any
Policies with effective dates prior to the termination date but issued after the
termination date are covered under this Agreement. Additionally, the reinsurance
hereunder shall continue to apply as to Policies which must be issued or
renewed, as a matter of state law or regulation or because the appointment of a
producing agent has not been timely canceled, until the expiration dates on said
Policies. The General Agent agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, its appointment by the Company to produce business terminates when
this Agreement terminates unless the General Agent's authority has been
terminated earlier. The Company may provide the General Agent with the limited
agency authority needed to service the run-off of the business, e.g., issue,
cancel, or offer renewal where required by law.

5.04 Upon termination of this Agreement, the Reinsurer and the General Agent
shall not be relieved of or released from any obligation created by or under
this Agreement in relation to payment, expenses, reports, accounting or
handling, which relate to insurance business reinsured under this Agreement. The
Parties hereto expressly covenant and agree that they will cooperate with each
other in the handling of all such run-off insurance business until all Policies
have expired either by cancellation or by the terms of such Policies and all
outstanding losses and loss adjustment expenses have been settled. While by law
and regulation the Company recognizes its primary obligations to its
policyholders, the Reinsurer and General Agent recognize that to the extent
possible there shall be no cost to or involvement by the Company in servicing
this run-off. Upon termination of this Agreement, the General Agent shall
service the run-off of the business, and its duties for such run-off shall
include, but not be limited to, handling all claims, and handling and servicing
all policies through their natural expiration, together with any policy
renewals, required to be made by provisions of applicable law, whether or not
the effective date of such renewal is subsequent to the effective date of
cancellation of this Agreement. All costs and expenses associated with the
handling of such run-off business following the cancellation or termination of
this Agreement shall be borne solely by the General Agent; however, the
Reinsurer


                                       4
<PAGE>
shall be ultimately responsible for the run-off and shall pay directly any such
costs and/or expenses if the General Agent does not for any reason pay or cause
to be paid such costs and expenses. If for any reason the General Agent fails or
is unable to service any such run-off business (or any business while the
Agreement is still in effect), including the payment of claims, then consistent
with this Agreement, the Reinsurer's obligation with respect to such run-off
business shall continue and the Reinsurer shall appoint a successor to the
General Agent, subject to the approval of the Company, to administer and
otherwise handle the run-off as provided herein. Such successor shall perform
all of the duties and obligations of the General Agent with respect to servicing
such run-off business, including the payment of claims. In addition, the Company
in its sole discretion may terminate the authority of the General Agent or a
successor thereto to handle such run-off business and the Reinsurer shall then
appoint a successor to handle the run-off, subject to the Company's approval, at
no cost to the Company.

5.05 In the event this Agreement is terminated, the Reinsurer shall remain
liable to and shall, immediately upon request, reimburse the Company for any
assessment made upon the Company by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State
of Texas under Article 21.28-C (Texas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty
Act) of the Texas Insurance Code, which applies to the risks reinsured
hereunder. The Company shall likewise remain liable for, and account to the
Reinsurer for, any recovery of such assessment or any credit allowed against its
premium tax applicable to the risks reinsured hereunder.

5.06 The title and ownership of all undelivered Policies, books, supplies or
other property related to the reinsured business is in the Company. Such
materials shall be delivered, within thirty (30) days of the termination hereof,
by the Reinsurer and/or General Agent to the Company, without compelling the
Company to resort to any legal proceedings to secure the aforesaid described
property of the Company.

5.07 This Agreement provides for termination on a run-off basis. The relevant
provisions of the Agreement shall apply to the business being run-off and shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                             RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

Nothing herein shall in any manner create any obligations, establish any rights
or create any direct right of action against the Reinsurer in favor of any third
party, or other person not party to this Agreement or create any privity of
contract between the policyholders and the Reinsurer.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                              RETENTION AND LIMIT

The Company shall cede and the Reinsurer shall accept 100% of the Company's
gross liability on each Policy reinsured hereunder and with respect to each risk
insured under each Policy.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                         COMMISSIONS, PAYMENTS AND FEES

8.01 In consideration of the acceptance by the Reinsurer of one hundred percent
(100%) of the Company's liability on insurance business reinsured hereunder, the
Reinsurer is entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Premiums (as
hereinafter defined) plus policy fees received by the General Agent or the
Company on Policies reinsured less (i) the ceding fee allowed the Company
pursuant to Section 8.02 hereof, (ii) the commission paid to the General Agent,
and (iii) premium taxes on Policies subject to reinsurance hereunder. "Net
Premiums" shall mean the gross premiums (excluding policy fees) charged on all
original and renewal Policies written on behalf of the Company, less return
premiums.

8.02 The Reinsurer shall pay the Company directly a fee, within forty-five (45)
days following the end of each month (as a ceding fee), equal to 2 1/2% of Net
Premiums, plus the amount of assessments and state premium taxes as provided in
this Article VIII. The ceding fee payable to the Company for all periods after
December 31, 2003 shall be 5%. For these purposes, a Policy's entire premium
shall be applied to the period in which the Policy is written.

8.03 The Reinsurer shall allow and pay within forty-five (45) days of the end of
each month to the Company an amount equal to the state premium tax on the net
written premiums reinsured hereunder for the past month. Should any additional
premium tax be assessed at any time on written premium reinsured hereunder, the
Reinsurer shall pay the Company such additional premium tax within fifteen (15)
days of being informed by the Company of such additional premium tax. The
Parties acknowledge that, at the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Texas
Comptroller of Public Accounts (or other state agency responsible for collecting
premium taxes) requires the payment of estimated premium taxes in advance on a
semi-annual basis. The Reinsurer shall, therefore, pay to the Company within
five days prior to the due date of any such estimated premium tax payment, the
amount that would be due based upon the business reinsured hereunder.

8.04 The Reinsurer hereby guarantees that the Company will receive the ceding
fee provided hereunder irrespective of any events, losses or developments for
the term of this Agreement. Such payment is not dependent upon the performance
of the General Agent, underwriting experience, loss experience, whether premium
is collected or not, or any other event foreseen or unforeseen by the parties at
the inception of this Agreement.

8.05 In consideration of the Reinsurer's assumption of the In Force Business, on
or before the Effective Date, the Company shall transfer to the Reinsurer the
assets listed in Schedule 8.05 hereto in an amount equal to (a) statutory loss
reserves (including incurred but not reported loss reserves), (b) loss
adjustment expense reserves, and (c) unearned premium reserves, for the In Force
Business, determined as of the Effective Date. The Reinsurer shall be required
to record and maintain the reserves on the In Force Business, consistent with
the reserving practices previously utilized by the Company, and the Company may
account for the reserves on its balance sheet as net of the reserves ceded to
the Reinsurer.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                         COMMISSION TO THE GENERAL AGENT

The General Agent shall receive direct from the Reinsurer, in full compensation
for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder and under the General
Agency Agreement, a commission based on Net Premium. Nothing in this Agreement
alters the Reinsurer's obligations to pay to the Company directly its ceding
fee, premium taxes and assessments as provided in the Agreement. The commission
owed the General Agent is an obligation owing directly between the Reinsurer and
the General Agent. The General Agent shall not seek to recover from the Company
any commissions due, and the Reinsurer shall not seek to recover from the
Company any return commissions due. No funds shall be due the General Agent from
the Company.

                                   ARTICLE X
          ASSIGNMENTS, ASSESSMENTS, PREMIUM TAXES, FINES AND PENALTIES

10.01 This Agreement shall apply to risks assigned to the Company under any
assigned risk plan if, in the sole discretion of the Company, such risks were
assigned to the Company because of the business written and reinsured hereunder.

10.02 With respect to the business reinsured hereunder, this Agreement shall
apply to and the Reinsurer shall immediately reimburse the Company 100% for any
assessments made against the Company pursuant to those laws and regulations
creating obligatory funds (including, but not limited to, insurance guaranty and
insolvency funds), pools (including catastrophe pools), board and bureau fees,
joint underwriting associations, FAIR plans and similar plans, or any
assessments made pursuant to the provisions of Article 21.28-C (Texas Property
and Insurance Guaranty Act) of the Texas Insurance Code, or successor statute
thereto. Amounts owed by the Reinsurer under this Article shall be payable
directly by the Reinsurer to the Company. The Reinsurer shall be entitled to
receive from the Company on or prior to the 31st day of March of each year
thereafter (or such date on which such premium taxes are paid) a sum equal to
the premium tax credit that is allowed to the Company with respect to such
assessments. The premium tax credit allowed the Reinsurer hereunder is to be on
a pro rata and first-in, first-out basis. The Company shall promptly return to
the Reinsurer any amount of assessment refunded to or credited to the Company
pursuant to the provisions of Article 21.28-C of the Texas Insurance Code.

10.03 The Reinsurer shall also pay promptly and directly to the Company any
fines, penalties, and/or any other charge incurred by the Company as respects
the business reinsured hereunder unless such fines, penalties and/or any other
charge was a direct result of any actual fraud or violation of criminal law by
the Company, which has been finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction after the exhaustion of all appeals.

10.04 The Reinsurer is responsible for and shall promptly pay all expenses
attributable to the facilities provided and services rendered under this
Agreement, which are not otherwise paid by the General Agent. These expenses
include, but are not limited to, salaries and all other benefits of all
employees of the Reinsurer; transportation, lodging, and meals of employees of
the Reinsurer; postage, and other delivery charges; advertising relating to the
Policies; printing of all


                                       7
<PAGE>
policies, forms and endorsements; EDP hardware, software, and programming;
countersignature fees or commissions; license and appointment fees for general
agents, agents, brokers, and solicitors; agent's taxes, including, but not
limited to, state and local sales taxes, if any; all taxes on premium and policy
fees produced for the business administered hereunder; adjustment expenses (both
allocated and unallocated) arising from claims on insurance written under this
Agreement; provision of office space, equipment and other facilities necessary
for the operation of Reinsurer; and reasonable legal and auditing expenses
incurred at the direction of the Reinsurer or resulting from the Texas Insurance
Code and/or any regulations affecting the Company with respect to the business
reinsured hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                PREMIUM FINANCING

With respect to Policies covered under the provisions of this Agreement, if any
premiums are financed, the General Agent shall receive and accept on behalf of
the Company all notices required by statute, contract or otherwise to be given
to the Company, including, without limitation, notices of the existence of
premium finance agreements or of cancellation of policies the premiums of which
are financed. No producing agent or any other agent shall be entitled to receive
or accept any notice on behalf of the Company, and the General Agent shall be
responsible for and will indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, claims, damages and expenses incurred
by reason of or arising out of any action taken or inaction suffered as a result
of receipt of any notice by any person, firm or entity other than the General
Agent or the Company. Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this
Agreement, the General Agent agrees to return and pay over to any premium
finance company (whether affiliated with the Company or not) which has sent
notice of cancellation of a financed policy to the General Agent pursuant to
Chapter 24 of the Texas Insurance Code, on behalf of the Company, within 30 days
of receipt of such notice of cancellation, any and all unearned commissions as
of the date of cancellation, together with any and all unearned premiums due any
premium finance company. The General Agent agrees to and does hereby relinquish
any and all rights to any unearned commissions for any such financed policy as
of the date of cancellation. The obligation of the General Agent to refund
unearned commissions and unearned premiums on a canceled financed policy shall
survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement for so long as any
Policy written under the terms of this Agreement remains in force. If the
General Agent does not fulfill its obligations to refund unearned commissions
and unearned premiums as provided in this Article XI and/or to indemnify the
Company as provided in this Article XI, then the Reinsurer shall pay the amount
of the refund owed and/or shall indemnify the Company even if the premium
finance company is an affiliate of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                              ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS

reports with respect to the business reinsured under this Agreement as needed by
the Company to prepare its monthly, quarterly and annual statements to
regulatory authorities.

<PAGE>
within eighteen (18) months of the effective date of termination, or at such
date at which all claims and liabilities reinsured hereunder have been

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                        LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE

13.01 The Reinsurer shall assume 100% of the risks covered by this Agreement and
shall be liable for and pay directly to the insureds on behalf of the Company
100% of all claims, losses, judgments, interest on judgments, settlements
whether under strict policy conditions or because of compromise, and expenses
incurred by the Company and/or General Agent (including, but not limited to,
costs, expenses and fees, including attorneys' fees and expenses, resulting from
a declaratory judgment or injunctive action brought by an insured or other
person). The Reinsurer shall be credited with 100% of any amount received by the
Company as salvage or recovery.

13.02 The Company hereby empowers the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer may, in its
discretion, and under its supervision appoint the General Agent, to accept
notice of and investigate any claim arising under any of the Policies, to pay,
adjust, settle, resist, or compromise any such claim, unless the Company with
reasonable justification specifically directs to the contrary with respect to
any individual claim. In the latter event, the Reinsurer and/or General Agent
shall follow the instructions of the Company as respects such claim. All such
loss settlements, whether under strict policy conditions or by way of
compromise, shall be unconditionally binding upon the Reinsurer. However, should
the Company be ordered or instructed by the Texas Department of Insurance or any
other regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to take any action or refrain
from taking any action with regard to any claim, and prompt notice of such order
or instruction is provided by the Company to the Reinsurer and General Agent,
the Reinsurer and/or the General Agent shall be bound by and shall follow the
order or instructions of such regulatory agency as though the Reinsurer and/or
the General Agent were the object of such order or instruction. The Reinsurer
and/or the General Agent will exercise the authority granted hereunder in good
faith and toward the end of paying any and all valid claims.

13.03 The Company will promptly notify the Reinsurer or the General Agent of any
claim, suit or action brought against the Company under any of the Policies when
actually notified of a claim, suit or action against the Company, and will
promptly furnish to the Reinsurer or the General Agent all summons, citations,
complaints, petitions, counterclaims and other pleadings and legal instruments
served upon the Company in connection therewith. The Company hereby further
empowers the Reinsurer to dispose of any salvage received as the result of any
loss settlement hereunder, and to enforce any right of the Company against any
person or organization for damages or equitable relief for any loss under any of
the Policies, employing legal counsel where necessary, and all sums received as
a result thereof will be treated as current loss recoveries by the Company and
the Reinsurer. The Company further agrees to furnish the Reinsurer, on request,
any and all legal instruments necessary to implement the foregoing
authorizations. Upon reasonable request, the Reinsurer shall furnish to the
Company any or all documents and correspondence relating to the subject matter
hereof.

<PAGE>
13.04 All records pertaining to claims arising under the Policies shall be
deemed to be jointly owned records of the Company and the Reinsurer, and shall
be made available to the Company or the Reinsurer or their respective
representatives or any duly appointed examiner for any state within the United
States. The Company, the Reinsurer and the General Agent agree that they will
not destroy any such records in their possession without the prior written
approval of the others, except that the Company and the Reinsurer shall not be
required to retain files longer than required by the guidelines set by the Texas
Department of Insurance.

13.05 The Reinsurer shall, or shall cause the General Agent to, establish a
separate claim register or method of registering claims arising under the
Policies covered by this Agreement so that all claims may be segregated and
identified separate and apart from other records of the Reinsurer or General
Agent, with such claims register to identify each claim on an individual case
basis both as to identify the insured(s) and the claimant and the reserve for
loss and adjusting expense. Such claim register shall be kept in a form whereby
the Company can, at any time, determine the status of any claim arising under
Policies covered by this Agreement. Such records shall reflect the amount of
reserves established for the individual claim and the date when such reserve was
established, and if closed, whether such claim was closed with or without
payment, and if with payment, the amount paid thereon.

13.06 The Reinsurer shall be liable for 100% of the loss adjustment expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with claims and settlements under Policies
subject hereto, including, but not limited to, all attorney's fees, other
litigation expenses and interest on judgments and all other expenses (including
but not limited to attorney's fees and costs incurred in a declaratory judgment
or injunctive action with an insured or other), but not including office
expenses or salaries of the Company's regular employees. The Reinsurer shall be
credited with 100% of any recoveries of such loss adjustment expense.

                                   ARTICLE XIV
                       LOSS IN EXCESS OF POLICY LIMITS/ECO

14.01 In the event the Company pays or is held liable to pay an amount of loss
in excess of its policy limit, but otherwise within the terms of its Policy
(hereinafter called "loss in excess of policy limits") or any punitive,
exemplary, compensatory or consequential damages other than loss in excess of
policy limits (hereinafter called "extra contractual obligations") in relation
to handling a claim reinsured hereunder or anything else related to the business
reinsured hereunder, 100% of the loss in excess of policy limits and/or 100% of
the extra contractual obligations shall be added to the Company's loss, if any,
under the Policy involved, and the sum thereof shall be reinsured 100% under
this Agreement.

14.02 An extra contractual obligation shall be deemed to have occurred on the
same date as the loss covered or alleged to be covered under the Policy
involved.

14.03 Notwithstanding any provision herein, this Agreement shall not apply to
any loss incurred by the Company as a result of any actual fraud and/or
violation of a criminal law, which has been finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction after the exhaustion of any appeals, by an


                                       11
<PAGE>
officer or director of the Company acting individually or collectively in
collusion with any individual, corporation or any other organization or party
involved in the presentation, defense or settlement of any claim covered
hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XV
                              ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

The Company shall not be prejudiced, in any way, by any omission through
clerical error, accident or oversight to cede to the Reinsurer any Policy, loss
or liability of any kind rightly falling under the terms of this Agreement, or
by erroneous cancellation, either partial or total, of any cession, or by
omission to report, or by erroneously reporting any losses, or by any other
error or omission, but any such error or omission shall be corrected immediately
upon discovery.

                                   ARTICLE XVI
                                ACCESS TO RECORDS

The Reinsurer or its duly appointed representatives shall have access at any and
all reasonable times to such books and records of the Company or the General
Agent, its departmental or branch offices, as shall reflect premium and loss
transactions of the Company and/or the business produced hereunder, for the
purpose of obtaining any and all information concerning this Agreement or the
subject matter thereof. Likewise, the Company or its duly appointed
representatives shall have access at any and all reasonable times to such books
and records of the Reinsurer and/or General Agent, its departmental or branch
offices as shall reflect premium and loss transactions of the Company and/or the
business produced hereunder, for the purpose of obtaining any and all
information concerning this Agreement or the subject matter hereof.

                                  ARTICLE XVII
                           REINSURER SALE OR TRANSFER

The Reinsurer agrees to give the Company ninety (90) days advance written notice
of any change of control, any sale or transfer of such party's business, or such
party's merger or consolidation with a successor firm, in order that the Company
may, in its sole discretion:

      (a)   Allow assignment of this Agreement to the successor;

      (b)   Enter into a new reinsurance agreement with the successor; or

      (c)   Terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 5.02(h) of this
            Agreement.

Provided, however, if the transaction involving a change of control, sale,
transfer, merger or consolidation of the Reinsurer is with an insurance company
or insurance group that has an A.M. Best Company rating of "A-" or higher, and
the performance of, or liability for, any obligation hereunder is to be assumed
by an insurance company with an A.M. Best Company rating of "A-" or higher, then
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement and shall allow the assignment


                                       12

and/or delegation of the duties, obligations and liabilities hereunder as long
as the terms thereof are no less favorable to the Company than as set forth
herein.

                                 ARTICLE XVIII
                                  INSOLVENCY

18.01 In the event of insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be
payable directly to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or
statutory successor on the basis of the liability of the Company without
diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or because the liquidator,
receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has failed to pay
all or a portion of any claims.

18.02 It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or
statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of
the pendency of a claim against the Company (indicating the Policy reinsured),
which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer,
within thirty (30) days after such claim is filed in the insolvency,
conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during
the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claims and
interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be
adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company
or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense
thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of
the Court, against the Company as part of the expense of conservation or
liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the benefit which may accrue to
the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.

18.03 Where two or more reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority
in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be
apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as though such
expense had been incurred by the Company.

18.04 It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency
of the Company, the reinsurance under this Agreement shall be payable directly
by the Reinsurer to the Company or to its liquidator, receiver or statutory
successor, except (i) as provided by applicable law, (ii) where this Agreement
specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the
insolvency of the Company, and (iii) where the Reinsurer with the consent of the
direct insured or insureds has assumed such Policy obligations of the Company as
direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such Policies and in
substitution for the obligation of the Company to such payees.

                                   ARTICLE XIX
                                THE GENERAL AGENT

19.01 The Company and the General Agent have entered into the Amendment to
General Agency-Company Agreement effective , 2002 (together with the General
Agency-Company Agreement dated October ____, 1992, the "General Agency
Agreement"), a complete copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and
incorporated herein


                                       13
<PAGE>
by reference. The Reinsurer has selected the General Agent to administer the
business reinsured hereunder. While for regulatory purposes, the General Agent
will need to be appointed as the Company's agent, it is recognized that the
General Agent is acting on behalf of the Reinsurer. The Company has no
obligation to furnish reports or statistics to the Reinsurer. The Company shall
file with the State of Texas all reports requested, based upon information
received from the General Agent and the Reinsurer.

19.02 The General Agent will not establish any sub-general agencies or any
agencies with the authority of a general agency.

19.03 The General Agent shall be responsible for the control of the producing
agents appointed by the Company at the request of and on behalf of the
Reinsurer, including compliance with state licensing laws and the financial
condition of such agents.

19.04 The Reinsurer shall guarantee payment to the Company of any amounts due
the Company from business produced by and/or Policies issued by or through the
producing agents appointed by the Company at the request of and on behalf of the
General Agent and the Reinsurer. The Reinsurer and the General Agent shall be
solely responsible for notifying such agents of this Agreement and of any
termination hereof, and the Reinsurer shall be responsible for the consequences
of any failure to provide such notification.

19.05 The General Agent shall not sue, or seek arbitration, against the Company
for any acts of the Reinsurer and shall indemnify and hold the Company harmless
from and against any damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by reason of the
Reinsurer's acts or failures to act.

19.06 The Company shall conduct or have conducted the examinations of the
General Agent as provided in the General Agency Agreement. The Reinsurer shall
indemnify and hold the Company harmless as respects any liability, damage,
charge, cost, fine, or penalty the Company may incur as a result of such
examinations.

                                   ARTICLE XX
                            HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS

20.01 Notwithstanding any provision contained herein, as respects all matters
related to this Agreement, in addition to those specific provisions insulating
the Company from specific risks hereunder, the Reinsurer hereby covenants and
agrees to reimburse and hold the Company harmless from and against every claim,
demand, liability, loss, damage, cost, charge, attorneys' fees, expense, suit,
order, judgment and adjudication of whatever kind or character regarding (i)
this Agreement and/or (ii) the business reinsured hereunder (including, but not
limited to, underwriting loss, credit loss, run-off expenses and all legal fees
and expenses incurred by the Company in asserting its rights under this
Agreement) whether or not such claim, demand, loss, damage, cost, charge,
attorneys' fees, expense, suit, order, judgment or liability is within the terms
of Policies written and reinsured hereunder. The Reinsurer's obligation hereto
relates to, but is not limited to the following: all liability for agents'
balances; return premiums and commissions; deceptive trade practice liability;
premiums, policy fees or other charges (whether collected or


                                       14
<PAGE>
not); costs, liability, damages, fees and/or expenses incurred by the Company
due to a lawsuit between the Reinsurer and/or the General Agent; all actions or
inactions of the General Agent or any other agent relating to performance under
this Agreement, under the General Agency Agreement or under any agreement with a
premium finance company; and all fees and/or commissions owing to the General
Agent under this and the aforementioned related agreements.

20.02 The Company shall not be liable to the Reinsurer for premiums unless the
Company itself has actually received those premiums and wrongfully not remitted
them to the Reinsurer. The Reinsurer may not offset any balances on account of
losses, loss adjustment expenses or any other amounts due except as to premiums
actually received by the Company itself (as distinct from premiums not
collected, premiums collected by the General Agent, or premiums placed in the
premium trust account pursuant to the General Agency Agreement) which have
wrongfully not been transmitted to the Reinsurer.

20.03 If for any reason the General Agent fails or is unable to administer the
Policies reinsured hereunder (whether the Agreement is still in effect or the
business is being run-off), the Reinsurer shall appoint a party (acceptable and
approved by the Company) to administer the business and the Reinsurer shall be
responsible for 100% of the cost of said administration. If return premiums or
other funds need to be returned to premium finance companies, policyholders or
sub-agents, the Reinsurer shall pay these amounts if the successor or
administrator does not.

20.04 The Reinsurer shall not sue, or seek arbitration, against the Company for
any acts of the General Agent for any monies which the General Agent owes unless
the Company has actually received those monies and has wrongfully not remitted
them to the Reinsurer; and the Reinsurer shall indemnify the Company for any
damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by reason of the General Agent's acts
or failure to act. The Company is not responsible for any commissions or other
monies payable to the General Agent in connection with this Agreement and the
General Agent shall not sue, or seek arbitration against, the Company for any
actions by, or debts owing from, the Reinsurer. The Reinsurer shall not seek to
recover from, or offset against, the Company any sums, whether premiums or other
monies, which the General Agent was unable or unwilling to remit to the Company
or the Reinsurer.

20.05 In the event the Reinsurer, or any agent appointed pursuant to this
Agreement, binds the Company for insurance coverage on insurance risks contrary
to the restrictions and limitations set forth in this Agreement, whether
intentional or not, the Reinsurer and General Agent will do such things and take
such actions as may be necessary to reduce the Company's exposure to such risks
and to hold the Company harmless against any liability or loss which may be
incurred by the Company in excess hereof. At the Company's request, the General
Agent in accordance with applicable law, and policy terms, shall cancel or not
renew any risk bound which is not in conformance with this Agreement. Any such
insurance coverage on insurance risks bound contrary to the restrictions and
limitations set forth in this Agreement, whether intentional or not, shall be
100% reinsured and subject to this Agreement.

                              TRUST FUND AGREEMENT

The Reinsurer shall immediately secure its obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to a trust account established under a Reinsurance Trust Agreement, to
be executed by the Reinsurer and the Company, which Reinsurance Trust Agreement
shall be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The assets deposited in the
trust account shall be valued according to their current fair market values and
shall consist only of cash and other types of assets identified in the
Reinsurance Trust Agreement; provided, however, none of the assets deposited
into the trust account shall consist of investments issued by the parent,
subsidiary or affiliate of either the Reinsurer or the Company. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement, the assets held in the trust account shall only
be withdrawn, utilized and applied in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Reinsurance Trust Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XXII
                               REGULATORY MATTERS

22.01 It is the Parties' understanding that the Texas Department of Insurance
views premiums which are over 90 days due (aged by item and effective date) to
the Company as non-admitted assets. In confirmation of the liabilities assumed
by the Reinsurer under this Agreement, the Reinsurer hereby assumes 100% of all
liability and responsibility for all premiums in the course of collection.

22.02 The Reinsurer shall agree, at no cost to the Company, to take those
actions (including, but not limited to, modifications in how funds are handled
and how accounts are cleared and settled) and agree to those arrangements
necessary to ensure that the Company suffers no adverse impact because of this
reinsurance program and is in compliance with the laws of the State of Texas and
regulations promulgated by any governmental entity thereof, including the Texas
Department of Insurance, in so far as this reinsurance program is concerned.

22.03 If at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Reinsurer shall no
longer be licensed or accredited to transact the business of insurance or
reinsurance in the State of Texas, the Reinsurer agrees that it shall submit to
a court of competent jurisdiction within the United States, shall agree to
comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction, shall
designate an agent upon whom service of process may be effected, and shall agree
to abide by the final decision of such court or an appellate court to which such
court's decision is appealed.

                                   ARBITRATION

24.01 As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of
any dispute or difference of opinion hereafter arising between the Company and
the Reinsurer with respect to this Agreement, or with respect to these Parties'
obligations hereunder, it is hereby mutually agreed that such dispute or
difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.

24.02 One arbiter (an "Arbiter") shall be chosen by the Company and one Arbiter
shall be chosen by the Reinsurer and an umpire (an "Umpire") shall be chosen by
the Arbiters, all of whom shall be active or retired disinterested executive
officers of property and casualty insurance or reinsurance companies.

24.03 In the event that a party fails to choose an Arbiter within thirty (30)
days following a written request by either party to the other to name an
Arbiter, the party who has chosen its Arbiter may choose the unchosen Arbiter.
Thereafter, the Arbiters shall choose an Umpire before entering upon
arbitration. If the Arbiters fail to agree upon the selection for the Umpire
within thirty (30) days following their appointment, each Arbiter shall name
three nominees, of whom the other shall decline two, and the decision shall be
made by drawing lots.

24.04 Each party shall present its case to the Arbiters and Umpire within a
reasonable amount of time after selection of the Umpire, unless the period is
extended by the Arbiters and the Umpire in writing and/or at a hearing in
Dallas, Texas. The Arbiters and Umpire shall consider this Agreement as an
honorable engagement, as well as a legal obligation, and they are relieved of
all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law
regarding entering of evidence. The decision in writing by a majority of the
Arbiters and Umpire when filed with the Parties shall be final and binding on
the parties. Judgment upon the final decision of the Arbiters and Umpire may be
entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

24.05 In the event of a dispute between the Company and the Reinsurer concerning
this Agreement and the General Agency Agreement (regardless of whether either
party has claims against the General Agent), the entire dispute between the
Company and the Reinsurer shall be subject to arbitration as provided in this
Article XXIV.

24.06 The costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators and
the umpire, shall be borne equally unless the Arbiters and Umpire shall decide
otherwise.

24.07 This Agreement shall be interpreted under the laws of Texas and the
arbitration shall be governed and conducted according to the Texas General
Arbitration Act.

                                   ARTICLE XXV
                                 SAVINGS CLAUSE

If any law or regulation of any federal, state or local government of the United
States of America, or the ruling of officials having supervision over insurance
companies, should prohibit or render illegal this Agreement, or any portion
hereof, as to risks or properties located in the jurisdiction of such authority,
either the Company or the Reinsurer may upon written notice to the other suspend
or abrogate this Agreement insofar as it relates to risks or properties located
within such


                                       17
<PAGE>
jurisdiction to such extent as may be necessary to comply with such law,
regulations or ruling. Such illegality shall in no way affect any other portion
hereof, provided however, that the Company may terminate or suspend this
Agreement insofar as it relates to the business to which such law or regulation
may apply.

                                  ARTICLE XXVI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

26.10 The Parties hereto intend all provisions of this Agreement to be enforced
to the fullest extent permitted. Accordingly, should a court of competent

the Company, and in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and the

another Company, except upon specific written instructions from the Company.
When directed by the Company, the Reinsurer will cancel any and all Policies
produced by it for any reason the Company deems necessary.

               insurance contracts with respect to risks located in the State of

               Agent is legally authorized, which is listed in Schedule A which
               is incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement for all
               intents and purposes;

          2.   Bind and execute insurance contracts on those lines of insurance
               as provided in Schedule A and, subject to all written manuals,
               releases and underwriting directions of the Company. The General
               Agent agrees to notify the Company of any binders, insurance
               contracts, endorsements and certificates. If the General Agent
               fails to do so within the number of days for which binding
               authority is indicated in Schedule A, said binders or insurance
               contracts shall be invalid. The General Agent's binding authority
               may not be delegated;

          3.   Provide all usual and customary services of an insurance agent on

               Company, subject to the limitations provided for herein;

          4.   Collect and receipt for premiums. The General Agent shall not
               receive any commission or other form of compensation for
               performing its duties hereunder. The General Agent agrees to
               refund return commissions on policy cancellations or reductions,
               in each case at the same rate at which such commissions were
               originally retained on behalf of any producing agent;

          5.   Exercise his authority personally or through his authorized
               employees;

          6.   Represent other companies;

                    (ii) the increase of liability, or (iii) the assignment of

               provisions of this Agreement, including those modified by this

               acceptable to all interested parties the reinsurance of all
               existing policies with another company selected by the General
               Agent and approved by the Company, which approval shall not be

               bordereau of the business insured.

     c.   The Company may, by notice to the General Agent, suspend the General
          Agent's authority to write any new or renewal business or issue any
          endorsements or otherwise restrict the authority of the General Agent
          if:

               insurance coverage as required by Section XII; or

          7.   There exists any of the circumstances under which the General
               Agent may be terminated under Section IX.a., above.

     d.   In the event of suspension of the General Agent's authority or
          termination of this Agreement:

          1.   The General Agent's records, and use and control of expirations
               shall remain the property of the General Agent and shall be left
               in his undisputed possession, provided the General Agent has then
               rendered and continues to render timely accounts and payments of
               all amounts due the Company, or provides security therefor
               acceptable to the Company. Otherwise, the records, use and
               control of all expirations of business placed with the Company
               shall become vested in the Company.

               shall remain liable for the balance of such indebtedness. Any
               amount realized in excess of indebtedness, less expense of
               disposing of such records and expiration shall be returned to the
               General Agent.

            GAINSCO County Mutual Insurance Company, and any other insurance
            companies which are now, or which may hereafter become, affiliated
            with any of the foregoing insurance companies and all proceeds and
            products of all of the foregoing ("Collateral"). The General Agent
            will sign any papers, that the Company considers necessary to
            obtain, maintain and perfect this security interest or to comply
            with any relevant law.

        b.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as hereinafter
            defined), the General Agent at his own expense shall take all
            necessary action promptly to collect his Accounts and shall pay
            all proceeds to the Company immediately upon receipt in the exact
            form received without commingling with other property. Upon the
            occurrence of an Event of Default, the General Agent shall (i)
            deposit the proceeds with the Company immediately upon receipt or
            (ii) notify account debtors that their accounts have been assigned
            to the Company and shall be paid directly to the Company. Upon the
            occurrence of an Event of Default, the Company may, at its option,
            notify account debtors to pay the Accounts directly to the Company,
            and may collect, sue, compromise on terms it considers proper,
            endorse, sell or otherwise deal with the Accounts either in its own
            name or that of the General Agent.

        c.  The Expirations constitute confidential business information and
            trade secrets which are used by the General Agent in its business
            to obtain a competitive advantage over the General Agent's
            competitors who do not know or have use thereof. The protection of
            the Expirations against unauthorized disclosure and use is of
            critical importance to the Company and the General Agent therefore
            agrees that it shall not at any time sell, copy or have copies made
            of, assign, distribute or disclose the Expirations, or any part
            thereof, to any other person or organization except as specifically
            authorized in writing by the Company and further agrees that it
            shall employ reasonable efforts to confine knowledge and use of the
            Expirations only to its officers and employees who require such
            knowledge and use in the ordinary course and scope of their
            employment by the General Agent. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
            Default, the General Agent, in addition to the foregoing, shall
            make no further use of the Expirations or exercise any rights with
            respect thereto, including use of the Expirations for the purpose
            of solicitation of renewal policies, except at otherwise consented
            to in writing by the Company.

        d.  The General Agent will be in default upon any of these events or
            conditions ("Events of Default"): (i) failure to make payment when
            due of any of the Obligations; or (ii) the termination of the
            Agreement pursuant to paragraphs a.1, a.2 or a.4 of Section IX of
            the Agreement; or (iii) at any time that, in the opinion of
            Company, the financial condition of the General Agent becomes
            impaired or the Collateral becomes insufficient or unsafe.

        e.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and at any time
            thereafter, the Company may, upon written notice to the General
            Agent, declare all or


                                       5

                                    [STAMP]
<PAGE>
          any of the Obligations immediately due and payable and will have, in
          addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of
          a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code, as enacted in the
          State of Texas, and under all other applicable laws. The General Agent
          recognizes that irreparable injury and damage will result to the
          Company in the event of the breach by the General Agent of any
          warranty, representation, or agreement of the General Agent contained
          in this Agreement. The Company shall be entitled, in addition to any
          legal or equitable remedies and damages available, to an injunction to
          restrain the violation of any such warranty, representation or
          agreement by the General Agent and any and all other persons acting
          for or in behalf of the General Agent.

          longer.

     e.   This Agreement supersedes all previous agency agreements, whether
          written or oral, between the Company and the General Agent and shall
          remain in full force and effect until terminated as provided herein.

                           REINSURANCE TRUST AGREEMENT

      Trust Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of the effective date
("Effective Date") set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto ("Schedule 1") by and
among the grantor identified on Schedule 1 (the "Grantor"), the beneficiary as
identified on Schedule 1 (together with any successor thereof by operation of
law, including, without limitation, any liquidator, rehabilitator, receiver or
conservator the "Beneficiary") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as trustee ("Trustee").
(The Grantor, the Beneficiary and the Trustee are hereinafter each sometimes
referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties").

                                   WITNESSETH:

      WHEREAS, the Grantor and the Beneficiary have entered into the reinsurance
agreement listed in Exhibit A hereto (the "Reinsurance Agreement");

      WHEREAS, the Beneficiary desires the Grantor to secure payments of all
amounts at any time and from time to time owing by the Grantor to the
Beneficiary under or in connection with the Reinsurance Agreement and desires to
create a trust arrangement that complies with TEX.INS.CODE Article 5.75-1(d) and
28 TEX. ADMIN. CODE Section  7.609;

      WHEREAS, the Grantor desires to transfer to the Trustee for deposit to a
trust account (the "Trust Account") assets in order to secure payments under or
in connection with the Reinsurance Agreement;

      WHEREAS, the Trustee has agreed to act as Trustee hereunder, and to hold
such assets in trust in the Trust Account for the sole use and benefit of the
Beneficiary as described herein; and

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is made for the sole use and benefit of the
Beneficiary and for the purpose of setting forth the duties and powers of the
Trustee with respect to the Trust Account;

      NOW, THEREFORE, for and consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the
Parties hereby agree as follows:

1. DEPOSIT OF ASSETS TO THE TRUST ACCOUNT.

      (a) The Grantor shall establish the Trust Account and the Trustee shall
administer the Trust account in its name as Trustee for the Beneficiary. The
Trust Account shall be subject to withdrawal by the Beneficiary solely as
provided herein.

      (b) Upon the establishment of the Trust Account, the Grantor shall
transfer to the Trustee, for deposit to the Trust Account, the assets listed in
Exhibit B hereto in the amount of $_______ [105% of actuarially determined
reserves for losses, IBNR, loss expenses and unearned premium as


                                       1
<PAGE>
of June 30, 2002 less the lesser of aggregate claims paid and aggregate case
reserves with respect to claims closed prior to Closing], and thereafter may
transfer to the Trustee, for deposit to the Trust Account, such other assets as
it may from time to time desire (all such assets actually received in the Trust
Account are herein referred to individually as an "Asset" and collectively as
the "Assets"). The Assets shall consist only of cash (United States legal
tender) and Eligible Securities (as hereinafter defined).

      (c) The Grantor agrees to deposit with the Trustee additional Assets
necessary to maintain an amount in the Trust Account (based on the market value
of the Assets as of the end of each calendar quarter and including accrued
interest as of the end of each calendar quarter) equal to 105% of the amount of
the Obligations (as hereinafter defined) as of the end of each calendar quarter
(the amount of such Obligations, the "Quarterly Obligations Amount"). The
Quarterly Obligations Amount shall be determined in accordance with Section 1(d)
below. The deposit of any such necessary additional Assets by Grantor will be
made within ten (10) Business Days after the calculation of the Quarterly
Obligations Amount becomes operative for purposes of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 1(d) (or, in the limited case of the calendar quarter
ending December 31, 2003, in accordance with Section 1(e)). Upon delivery of
such Assets, the Grantor shall advise the Beneficiary in writing that such
delivery has been effected.

      (d) Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, the
Grantor shall deliver to Beneficiary all actuarial data reasonably necessary to
calculate the Quarterly Obligations Amount (including updated case reserves and,
at Grantor's sole option and expense, either its own or an independent third
party analysis or calculation of the Quarterly Obligations Amount). Within ten
(10) Business Days after its receipt of such data, Beneficiary shall deliver to
Grantor its calculation of the Quarterly Obligations Amount, including
supporting schedules and analysis. If Grantor objects in writing to
Beneficiary's calculation of the Quarterly Obligations Amount, Grantor and
Beneficiary shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
objection within five (5) Business Days after receipt by Grantor of
Beneficiary's calculation of the Quarterly Obligations Amount. If Grantor and
Beneficiary cannot mutually agree on a calculation of the Quarterly Obligations
Amount within such five (5) Business Day period, then Beneficiary's calculation
of the Quarterly Obligations Amount (as modified by any partial agreement
reached between Grantor and Beneficiary during such five (5) Business Day
period) shall be operative for purposes of this Agreement. If Beneficiary does
not deliver the calculation of the Quarterly Obligations Amount to Grantor
within ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of the data set forth in the
first sentence of this Section 1(d), any reasonable calculation by Grantor of
the Quarterly Obligations Amount thereafter delivered to Beneficiary shall be
operative for purposes of this Agreement. All calculations of the Quarterly
Obligations Amount, whether made by Grantor or Beneficiary, shall be made (i) in
accordance with the Standards of Practice issued by the Actuarial Standards
Board (including the Casualty Actuarial Society's Statement of Principles
Regarding Property and Casualty Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves) as
those standards may exist from time to time and (ii) after analysis of the
claims insured under the Reinsurance Agreement only on their own merits, without
a view to any extraneous factors. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 1(d), the calculation of the Quarterly Obligations Amount for the
calendar quarter ended December 31, 2003 shall be made in accordance with
Section 1(e) below, and this Section 1(d) shall not apply to such calculation.


                                       2
<PAGE>
      (e) On or before January 31, 2004, Grantor shall submit to
Tillinghast-Towers Perrin or another independent actuarial firm selected by
Grantor and reasonably acceptable to Beneficiary (Tillinghast-Towers Perrin or
such other independent actuarial firm, the "Independent Actuary") such
information as the Independent Actuary shall reasonably require to make a
calculation of the Quarterly Obligations Amount for the calendar quarter ended
December 31, 2003. The Independent Actuary's calculation of the Quarterly
Obligations Amount for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2003 shall be
operative for purposes of this Agreement. All fees, costs, charges and expenses
of the Independent Actuary shall be borne equally between Grantor and
Beneficiary. Grantor and Beneficiary may at any time, by mutual written consent,
waive the provisions of this Section 1(e) and instead choose to calculate the
Quarterly Obligations Amount for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2003
pursuant to Section 1(d).

      (f) The Grantor hereby represents and warrants (i) that any Assets
transferred by the Grantor to the Trustee for deposit to the Trust Account will
be in such form that the Beneficiary whenever necessary may, and the Trustee
upon direction by the Beneficiary will, negotiate any such Assets without
consent or signature from the Grantor or any person in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and (ii) that all Assets transferred by the Grantor to the
Trustee for deposit to the Trust Account consist only of cash and Eligible
Securities, which are free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances.

      (g) The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine whether the
Assets in the Trust Account are sufficient to secure the Grantor's liabilities
under the Reinsurance Agreement.

2. WITHDRAWAL OF ASSETS FROM THE TRUST ACCOUNT.

      (a) The Beneficiary shall have the right, at any time and from time to
time, to withdraw from the Trust Account, upon written notice to the Trustee
with a copy to the Grantor (the "Withdrawal Notice"), such Assets as are
specified in such Withdrawal Notice. The Withdrawal Notice may designate a third
party (the "Designee") to whom Assets specified therein shall be delivered. The
Beneficiary need present no statement or document in addition to a Withdrawal
Notice in order to withdraw any Assets, nor is said right of withdrawal or any
other provision of this Agreement subject to any conditions or qualifications
not contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that subsequent to any
withdrawal, upon Grantor's written request, Beneficiary shall furnish Grantor
with an explanation and reasonably specific supporting documentation for such
withdrawal.

      (b) Upon receipt of a Withdrawal Notice, the Trustee shall immediately
take any and all steps necessary to transfer the Assets specified in such
Withdrawal Notice and shall deliver such assets to or for the account of the
Beneficiary, the Grantor, or such Designee as specified in such Withdrawal
Notice.

      (c) Subject to paragraph (a) of this Section 2 and to Section 4 of this
Agreement, in the absence of a Withdrawal Notice, the Trustee shall allow no
substitution or withdrawal of any Asset from the Trust Account. Subject to this
Section 2, in the absence of a Withdrawal Notice the Trustee shall allow no
withdrawal of any Asset from the Trust Account.


                                       3
<PAGE>
      (d) The Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine that
any Assets withdrawn from the Trust Account pursuant to this Section 2 will be
used and applied in the manner contemplated by Section 3 of this Agreement.

      (e) Within five (5) Business Days after the end of each calendar month,
Grantor shall deliver to Beneficiary a notice substantially in the form of
Exhibit C hereto (the "Claims Closed Notice") setting forth the following
information with respect to each individual claimant claim covered by the
Reinsurance Agreement and closed during the last completed calendar month: (A)
the amount of case indemnity reserve (as reported by Grantor pursuant to Section
1(d) above for the most recently evaluated calendar quarter), (B) the amount of
case loss adjustment expense reserve (as updated by Grantor as of the end of the
most recently ended calendar quarter), (C) the amount of indemnity paid and (D)
the amount of allocated loss expense paid. The Claims Closed Notice also shall
set forth, with respect to each individual claimant claim contained therein,
evidence that such claim is closed. Within ten (10) Business Days after its
receipt of the Claims Closed Notice, Beneficiary may object to some or all of
the information contained in the Claims Closed Notice by delivering to Grantor a
notice (the "Claims Objection Notice") providing (i) a reasonably detailed
explanation specifying the reasons for Beneficiary's objections and (ii) a
revised Claims Closed Notice acceptable to Beneficiary. If Beneficiary does not
deliver a Claims Objection Notice to Grantor within such ten (10) Business Day
period, Grantor's Claims Closed Notice shall be operative for purposes of this
Agreement. If Beneficiary does deliver a Claims Objection Notice on a timely
basis, Grantor and Beneficiary shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve the disagreements within four (4) Business Days after receipt by Grantor
of the Claims Objection Notice. If Grantor and Beneficiary cannot mutually agree
within the four (4) Business Day period, then Beneficiary's Claims Closed Notice
as set forth in Beneficiary's Claims Objection Notice (as modified by any
partial agreement reached between Grantor and Beneficiary during such four (4)
Business Day period) shall be operative for purposes of this Agreement. Subject
to the provisions of the immediately following sentence, within fifteen (15)
Business Days after receipt by the Beneficiary of the Grantor's initial Claims
Closed Notice, Beneficiary shall deliver a Withdrawal Notice to Trustee naming
Grantor as the Designee and instructing the Trustee to pay Grantor an amount
withdrawn from the Trust Account equal to the lesser of (i) the sum of the
aggregate amount of case indemnity reserves plus the aggregate amount of case
loss adjustment expense reserves as set forth in the final Claims Closed Notice
or (ii) the sum of the aggregate amount of indemnity paid plus the aggregate
amount of allocated loss expense paid as set forth in the final Claims Closed
Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the calculation of a
Quarterly Obligations Amount in accordance with Section 1(d) or (e) is not
operative for purposes of this Agreement within forty-five (45) days after the
end of a given calendar quarter, Beneficiary's obligation to cause Trustee to
make the payment to Grantor pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall
be suspended until such time as the calculation of a Quarterly Obligations
Amount in accordance with Section 1(d) or (e) becomes operative for purposes of
this Agreement.

      (f) Within five (5) Business Days after the calculation of each Quarterly
Obligations Amount becomes operative for purposes of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 1(d) (or, in the limited case of the calendar quarter
ending December 31, 2003, in accordance with Section 1(e)), to the extent that
the amount of Assets in the Trust Account exceeds 105% of the Quarterly
Obligations Amount, Beneficiary shall deliver a Withdrawal Notice to Trustee
naming Grantor as the Designee


                                       4
<PAGE>
and instructing the Trustee to pay Grantor an amount withdrawn from the Trust
Account equal to such excess.

3. APPLICATION OF ASSETS.

      (a) The Beneficiary hereby covenants to the Grantor that it shall use and
apply any withdrawn Assets, without diminution because of the insolvency of the
Beneficiary or the Grantor, for the following purposes only:

            (i)   to pay or reimburse the Beneficiary for the Grantor's share
      under the Reinsurance Agreement regarding any losses and allocated and
      commercially reasonable unallocated loss expenses paid by the Beneficiary
      but not recovered from the Grantor, or for unearned premiums due to the
      Beneficiary, if not otherwise paid by the Grantor in accordance with the
      terms of the Reinsurance Agreement;

            (ii)  to pay Grantor pursuant to Section 2(e) or (f); or

            (iii) where the Beneficiary has received a Termination Notice (as
      hereinafter defined) pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement and where
      the Grantor's entire Obligations remain unliquidated and undischarged ten
      days prior to the Termination Date (as hereinafter defined), to withdraw
      amounts equal to such Obligations and deposit such amounts in a separate
      account, in the name of the Beneficiary, in any United States bank or
      trust company, apart from its other assets, in trust for the uses and
      purposes specified in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section as may
      remain executory after such withdrawal and for any period after such
      Termination Date.

      (b) The existence of the Trust Account, as security for the Obligations,
shall not affect the Grantor's liabilities under the Reinsurance Agreement, nor
shall the Assets of the Trust Account be used as an offset by the Grantor
against any Obligations to the Beneficiary.

4. REDEMPTION, INVESTMENT AND SUBSTITUTION OF ASSETS.

      (a) The Trustee shall surrender for payment all maturing Assets and all
Assets called for redemption and deposit the principal amount of the proceeds of
any such payment to the Trust Account.

      (b) From time to time, at the written order and direction of the Grantor
or its designated representative, the Trustee shall invest Assets in the Trust
Account in Eligible Securities.

      (c) From time to time the Grantor or its designated representative may
direct the Trustee to substitute Eligible Securities for other Eligible
Securities held in the Trust Account at such time. The Trustee shall have no
responsibility whatsoever to determine the value of such substituted securities
or that such substituted securities constitute Eligible Securities.

      (d) All investments and substitutions of securities referred to in
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 4 shall be in compliance with the
definition of "Eligible Securities" in Section 12 of this Agreement. The Trustee
shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine that any Assets in the


                                       5
<PAGE>
Trust Account are or continue to be Eligible Securities. Any instruction or
order concerning such investments or substitutions of securities shall be
referred to herein as an "Investment Order." The Trustee shall execute
Investment Orders and settle securities transactions by itself or by means of an
agent or broker. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any act or omission,
or for the solvency, of any such agent or broker unless said act or omission is
the result, in whole or in part, of the Trustee's negligence, willful misconduct
or lack of good faith. Unless otherwise instructed by Grantor, Trustee shall
invest and reinvest the Assets in the JPMorgan Prime #835 Money Market Fund (the
"Money Market Fund") and the Trustee or any of its affiliates may receive
compensation with respect to Assets invested or reinvested in the Money Market
Fund; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be permitted to
invade the trust corpus in excess of 1.00% of the corpus per annum for the
purpose of paying compensation to, or reimbursing the expenses of, the Trustee.

      (e) Any loss incurred from any investment pursuant to the terms of this
Section 4 shall be borne exclusively by the Trust Account. The Trustee shall
have no liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment in an
investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any
liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the
Parties to give the Trustee instructions to invest or reinvest the Trust
Account. Grantor shall make additional deposits pursuant to Section 1(c) in the
event such loss is incurred.

5. INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS. The Trustee shall collect, receive and hold in the
Trust Account in accordance with this Agreement any dividends, interest or other
income received in respect of the Assets in the Trust Account, but shall have no
responsibility with respect to the collection of such income beyond the exercise
of due care.

6. RIGHT TO VOTE ASSETS. The Trustee shall forward all annual and interim
stockholder reports and all proxies and proxy materials relating to the Assets
in the Trust Account to the Grantor. The Grantor shall have the full and
unqualified right to exercise any voting rights associated with the Assets in
the Trust Account.

7. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE TRUSTEE.

      (a) The Trustee shall notify the Grantor and the Beneficiary in writing
within ten days following each deposit to, or withdrawal from, the Trust
Account.

      (b) Before accepting any Asset for deposit to the Trust Account, the
Trustee shall determine that such Asset is in such form that the Beneficiary
whenever necessary may, or the Trustee upon direction by the Beneficiary will,
negotiate such Asset without consent or signature from the Grantor or any person
or entity other than the Trustee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

      (c) The Trustee may deposit any Assets in the Trust Account in a
book-entry account maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or in
depositories such as the Depository Trust Company. Assets may be held in the
name of a nominee maintained by the Trustee or by any such depository.

      (d) The Trustee shall accept and open all mail directed to the Grantor or
the Beneficiary in care of the Trustee.

      (e) The Trustee shall furnish to the Grantor and the Beneficiary a
statement of all Assets in the Trust Account upon the inception of the Trust
Account and at least the end of each calendar quarter thereafter.

      (f) Upon the request of the Grantor or the Beneficiary, the Trustee shall
promptly permit the Grantor or the Beneficiary, their respective agents,
employees or independent auditors to examine, audit, excerpt, transcribe and
copy, during the Trustee's normal business hours, any books, documents, papers
and records relating to the Trust Account or the Assets.

      (g) The Trustee is authorized to follow and rely upon all instructions
furnished to the Trustee from time to time by the Grantor and the Beneficiary,
respectively, and by attorneys-in-fact acting under written authority furnished
to the Trustee by the Grantor or the Beneficiary, including, without limitation,
instructions given by letter, facsimile transmission, telegram, teletype,
cablegram or electronic media, if the Trustee believes such instructions to be
genuine and to have been signed, sent or presented by the proper party or
parties. The Trustee shall not incur any liability to anyone resulting from
actions taken by the Trustee in reliance in good faith on such instructions. The
Trustee shall not incur any liability in executing instructions (i) from an
attorney-in-fact prior to receipt by it of notice of the revocation of the
written authority of the attorney-in-fact or (ii) from any officer of the
Grantor or the Beneficiary.

      (h) The duties and obligations of the Trustee shall only be such as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement, as it may from time to time be
amended, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement
against the Trustee. The Trustee shall only be liable for its own negligence,
willful misconduct or lack of good faith.

      (i) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Trustee to take any
action which, in the Trustee's reasonable judgment, would result in any
violation of this Agreement or any provision of law.

      (j) The Trustee may confer with counsel of its own choice in relation to
matters arising under this Agreement and shall have full and complete
authorization from the other Parties hereunder with respect to any action taken
or suffered by it under this Agreement or under any transaction contemplated
hereby in good faith and in accordance with opinion of such counsel.

8. THE TRUSTEE'S COMPENSATION, EXPENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION.

      (a) The Grantor shall pay the Trustee, as compensation for its services
under this Agreement, a fee computed at rates determined by the Trustee from
time to time and communicated in writing to the Grantor and initially as shown
on Schedule 3 attached hereto. The Grantor shall pay or reimburse the Trustee
for all of the Trustee's expenses and disbursements in connection with its
duties under this Agreement (including attorney's fees and expenses), except any
such expense, or disbursement as may arise from the Trustee's negligence,
willful misconduct or lack of good faith. The Grantor also hereby indemnifies
the Trustee for, and holds it harmless against, any loss, liability,


                                       7
<PAGE>
costs or expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred or made
without negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the
Trustee, arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including any loss,
liability, costs or expenses arising out of or in connection with the status of
the Trustee and its nominee as the holder of record of the Assets. In no event
shall the Trustee be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even
if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action.

      (b) Except as set forth in Section 4(d), no Assets shall be withdrawn from
the Trust Account or used in any manner for paying compensation to, or
reimbursement or indemnification of, the Trustee.

9. TINS. The Grantor and the Beneficiary each represent that its correct
Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") assigned by the Internal Revenue Service
or any other taxing authority is set forth in Schedule 1. Upon execution of this
agreement, the Grantor shall provide the Trustee with a fully executed W-8 or
W-9 Internal Revenue Service form, which shall include the Grantor's Tax
Identification Number (TIN), as assigned by the Internal Revenue Service. All
interest or other income earned under this Agreement shall be deposited pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement and reported by the recipient to the Internal
Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. Notwithstanding such written
directions, Trustee shall report and, as required withhold any taxes as it
determines may be required by any law or regulation in effect at the time of the
distribution. In the event that any earnings remain undeposited at the end of
any calendar year, Trustee shall report to the Internal Revenue Service or such
other authority such earnings as it deems appropriate or as required by any
applicable law or regulation or, to the extent consistent therewith, as directed
in writing by the Grantor. In addition, Trustee shall withhold any taxes it
deems appropriate and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

10. RESIGNATION OF THE TRUSTEE.

      (a) The Trustee may resign at any time by giving not less than 90 days'
written notice thereof to the Beneficiary and to the Grantor, such resignation
to become effective on the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee and
the transfer to such successor trustee of all Assets in the Trust Account in
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section 10.

      (b) Upon receipt of the Trustee's notice of resignation, the Grantor and
the Beneficiary shall appoint a successor trustee. Any successor trustee shall
be a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System and shall not be a
Parent, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of the Grantor or the Beneficiary. Upon the
acceptance of the appointment as trustee hereunder by a successor trustee,
payment of all fees due the Trustee and the transfer to such successor trustee
of all Assets in the Trust Account, the resignation of the Trustee shall become
effective. Thereupon, such successor trustee shall succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Trustee, and the
Trustee shall be discharged from any future duties and obligations under this
Agreement, but the Trustee shall continue after its resignation to be entitled
to the benefits of the indemnities provided herein for the Trustee.

11. TERMINATION OF THE TRUST ACCOUNT.

      (a) The Trust Account and this Agreement, except for the indemnities
provided herein, may be terminated only after (i) the Grantor or the Beneficiary
has given the Trustee written notice of its intention to terminate the Trust
Account (the "Notice of Intention"), (ii) the Trustee has given the Grantor and
the Beneficiary the written notice specified in paragraph (b) of this Section
11, (iii) the Reinsurance Agreement shall have terminated, and (iv) the
Beneficiary has given the Trustee written notice that all Obligations of the
reinsurer under the Reinsurance Agreement have been extinguished. The Notice of
Intention shall specify the date on which the notifying Party intends the Trust
Account to terminate (the "Proposed Date").

      (b) Within ten Business Days following receipt by the Trustee of the
Notice of Intention, the Trustee shall give written notification (the
"Termination Notice") to the Beneficiary and the Grantor of the date (the
"Termination Date") on which the Trust Account shall terminate. The Termination
Date shall be (a) the Proposed Date (or if not a Business Day, the next Business
Day thereafter), if the Proposed Date is at least 30 days but no more than 45
days subsequent to the date the Termination Notice is given; (b) 30 days
subsequent to the date the Termination Notice is given (or if not a Business
Day, the next Business Day thereafter), if the Proposed Date is fewer than 30
days subsequent to the date the Termination Notice is given; or (c) 45 days
subsequent to the date the Termination Notice is given (or if not a Business
Day, the next Business Day thereafter), if the Proposed Date is more than 45
days subsequent to the date the Termination Notice is given.

      (c) On the Termination Date, upon receipt of written approval of the
Beneficiary, the Trustee shall transfer to the Grantor any Assets remaining in
the Trust Account, at which time all liability of the Trustee with respect to
such Assets shall cease.

Parties, and there are no understandings or agreements, conditions or
qualifications relative to this Agreement which are not fully expressed in this

that Party's duties.

to Manager full and complete power and authority to:

         1.  establish and maintain a complete record of each policyholder of
             Company, the same to be maintained in compliance with any
             requirements of the Texas Department of Insurance;
<PAGE>
         2.  establish and maintain an adequate, complete and detailed
             accounting system with respect to the funds of Company and the

         3.  employ all necessary and required personnel deemed proper by

subject to the limitations herein. The Manager shall be paid the Net Income
monthly, on or before the 30th day of each month, such amounts from the Net
Income of the Company from the previous month. Should there be no Net Income of
the Company, there shall be no compensation paid to the Manager, and the
Manager shall forego all compensation until the company has Net Income after
offset for prior net losses. On or before April 1st of each year, the Net
Income paid to the Manager shall be adjusted to the actual Net Income of the
Company reflected in its Annual Statement filed with the Texas Department of
Insurance for the previous year and any sum due the Manager or the Company as a
result of such adjustment shall be paid on or before April 30th.
<PAGE>
         For purposes of this Agreement, Net Income shall be calculated on the
basis of the formula currently contained on Page 4 of the Annual Statement form
("Annual Statement"), Lines 1 through 16, excluding the management fee and
adjusted for gains/losses in surplus (Annual Statement, Page 4, Lines 19
through 23) and less ten percent (10%) of net income reflected on Line 16 of
the Annual Statement which the Company shall retain. The 10% of net income so
retained by the Company shall be paid to the Manager as soon as reasonably
possible after the Annual Statement of the Company has been filed for the
previous year, provided the Company has received prior approval of the
Commissioner of Insurance.

         However, in no event shall the management fee reduce the policyholder
surplus of the Company as calculated utilizing the formula on Page 3 of the
current Annual Statement form with all required adjustments for past due
receivables and unauthorized reinsurance below the greatest of the following:
(1) Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00); (2) one-third (1/3) of net retained
writings of the Company over the previous twelve (12) months; or (3) the
minimum surplus required by law.

SECTION V - DURATION, ASSIGNMENT

         This Contract shall become effective as of the date hereof and shall
continue in force for a duration of twenty-five (25) years unless terminated in

transferring this Contract in whole or in part, or any benefits thereunder, to
any person, persons, firm, corporation or legal entity of whatever nature, with
the consent of the board of directors of the Company. This Contract shall be
automatically renewed for additional 25-year periods unless either party gives
the other notice of termination six (6) months in advance of the conclusion of
the 25-year period.

SECTION VI - TERMINATION

         In the event the Manager fails to comply with its obligations under
this Contract, after notice of such failure to Manager, Company may cancel this
Contract on sixty (60) days written notice to Manager. The parties may cancel
this Contract at anytime, without cause, by mutual agreement. In the event it
shall ever be held, pursuant to any law of the State of Texas or any proper
rule of the Texas Department of Insurance, that this contract is contrary to
any such law, rule or regulation, then it is nevertheless declared to be the
intent of the parties to this contract that Manager, or its successor or
assignee, shall continue the exclusive direction of the affairs of Company
indefinitely until this Contract is terminated.

SECTION VII - GENERAL

A change in the number or names of the directors shall not require an amendment
to these articles. The board of directors shall have full power and authority to
manage the affairs of the Company and to elect such officers as may be provided
for in the Constitution and Bylaws.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                     INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,

                       EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS OF CORPORATION

         The Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the


ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION - PAGE 3


<PAGE>

Company) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
to, the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

         The Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or
suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company;
provided however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,
issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable
for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Company
except to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability but
in view of all circumstances of the


ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION - PAGE 4

<PAGE>

case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which such court shall deem proper.

         The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good
faith or in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was not unlawful.

         Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of
such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of a written representation by or
on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Company as authorized in this article.

         The indemnification hereunder shall be made only upon a determination
in the specific case that indemnification is proper under the substantive
standards established hereunder. Such determination shall be made (1) by the
board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who
were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is
not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the
members of Company.

         The Company shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and
incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such,
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against
such liability under the provisions of this article.

         The indemnification provided by this article shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be
entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of members or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person.

         EXECUTED to be effective the 27th day August, 1992.

the Company on all matters which come before any such meeting when any member or
policyholder does not attend the meeting, but subject to the right of each
policyholder to give notice to the contrary, in writing, to the Company prior to
any such meeting or meetings. Provided however, that no such proxy however
granted shall prevent any member or policyholder from casting his individual
vote on all matters which come before any such meeting at which he is attending.

                                   ARTICLE VII

         All premium income of the Company shall be allocated to the appropriate

basis or for any other term not exceeding five years.

policy the Company has in force a valid contract of reinsurance for the excess
risk.

         Section D. The Company shall have the authority to issue non-assessable
and non-contingent policies covering all such risks which it may insure under

      The purpose for which this Company is organized is to transact the
business of a county mutual insurance company on a statewide basis; namely, to
transact the business of insurance against loss or damage from fire, lightning,
gas explosion, theft, windstorm, hail, or any other hazard that any other fire
and windstorm insurance company operating in Texas may write on property
described in Article 17.01 of the Texas Insurance Code, as amended, all lines of
automobile insurance, including but not limited to automobile liability, bodily
injury, medical payments, property damage, automobile physical damage, fire,
theft, collision and comprehensive, and any other lines of insurance which a
county mutual insurance company may transact under the laws of the State of
Texas; and to issue non-assessable and non-contingent policies covering such
risks.

                                    ARTICLE V

      The number of directors of this Company shall be not less than five, and
all of them shall carry insurance in the Company in an amount not less than
$1,000.00 each. The powers of the Company shall be exercised by or under the
authority of, and the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under
the direction of, the board of directors of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE VI

A. In this article:

(1) "Company" includes any domestic or foreign predecessor entity of the Company
in a merger, consolidation, or other transaction in which the liabilities of the
predecessor are transferred to the Company by operation of law and in any other
transaction in which the Company assumes the liabilities of the predecessor but
does not specifically exclude liabilities that are the subject matter of this
article.

(2) "Director" means any person who is or was a director of the Company and any
person who, while a director of the Company, is or was serving at the request of
the Company as a director,
<PAGE>
officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar
functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint
venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise.

(3) "Expenses" includes court costs and attorneys' fees.

(4) "Official capacity" means:

(a) when used with respect to a director, the office of director in the Company;
and

(b) when used with respect to a person other than a director, the elective or
appointive office in the Company held by the officer or the employment or agency
relationship undertaken by the employee or agent in behalf of the Company; but

(c) in both Paragraphs (a) and (b) does not include service for any other
foreign or domestic corporation or any partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise.

(5) "Proceeding" means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or
investigative, any appeal in such an action, suit, or proceeding, and any
inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit, or proceeding.

B. The Company shall indemnify a person who was, is, or is threatened to be made
a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding because the person is or was a
director only if it is determined in accordance with Section F of this article
that the person:

(1) conducted himself in good faith;

(2) reasonably believed:

(a) in the case of conduct in his official capacity as a director of the
Company, that his conduct was in the Company's best interests; and

(b) in all other cases, that his conduct was at least not opposed to the
Company's best interests; and

(3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe
his conduct was unlawful.

C. Except to the extent permitted by Section E of this article, a director may
not be indemnified under Section B of this article in respect of a proceeding:

(1) in which the person is found liable on the basis that personal benefit was
improperly received by him, whether or not the benefit resulted from an action
taken in the person's official capacity; or

(2) in which the person is found liable to the Company.

D. The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction
or on a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not of itself determinative
that the person did not meet the requirements set forth in Section B of this
article. A person shall be deemed to have been found liable in respect of any
claim, issue or matter only after the person shall have been so adjudged by a
court of competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom.

E. A person shall be indemnified under Section B of this article against
judgments, penalties (including excise and similar taxes), fines, settlements,
and reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with the
proceeding; but if the person is found liable to the Company or is found liable
on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received by the person, the
indemnification (1) is limited to reasonable expenses actually incurred by the
person in connection with the proceeding, and (2) shall not be made in respect
of any proceeding in which the person shall have been found liable for willful
or intentional misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Company.

F. A determination of indemnification under Section B of this article must be
made:

(1) by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who at the time of
the vote are not named defendants or respondents in the proceeding;

(2) if such a quorum cannot be obtained, by a majority vote of a committee of
the board of directors, designated to act in the matter by a majority vote of
all directors, consisting solely of two
<PAGE>
or more directors who at the time of the vote are not named defendants or
respondents in the proceeding;

(3) by special legal counsel selected by the board of directors or a committee
of the board by vote as set forth in Subsection (1) or (2) of this section, or,
if such a quorum cannot be obtained and such a committee cannot be established,
by a majority vote of all directors; or

(4) by the members in a vote that excludes the vote of directors who are named
defendants or respondents in the proceeding.

G. Authorization of indemnification and determination as to reasonableness of
expenses must be made in the same manner as the determination that
indemnification is permissible, except that if the determination that
indemnification is permissible is made by special legal counsel, authorization
of indemnification and determination as to reasonableness of expenses must be
made in the manner specified by Subsection (3) of Section F of this article for
the selection of special legal counsel. This provision shall be deemed to
constitute authorization of indemnification in the manner required by applicable
law.

H. The Company shall indemnify a director against reasonable expenses incurred
by him in connection with a proceeding in which he is a named defendant or
respondent because he is or was a director if he has been wholly successful, on
the merits or otherwise, in the defense of the proceeding.

I. If, in a suit for the indemnification required by Section H of this article,
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the director is entitled to
indemnification under that section, the court shall order indemnification and
shall award to the director the expenses incurred in securing the
indemnification.

J. If, upon application of a director, a court of competent jurisdiction
determines, after giving any notice the court considers necessary, that the
director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the
relevant circumstances, whether or not he has met the requirements set forth in
Section B of this article or has been found liable in the circumstances
described by Section C of this article, the court may order the indemnification
that the court determines is proper and equitable; but if the person is found
liable to the Company or is found liable on the basis that personal benefit was
improperly received by the person, the indemnification shall be limited to
reasonable expenses actually incurred by the person in connection with the
proceeding.

K. Reasonable expenses incurred by a director who was, is, or is threatened to
be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding shall be paid or
reimbursed by the Company, in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding
and without the determination specified in Section F of this article or the
authorization or determination specified in Section G of this article, after the
Company receives a written affirmation by the director of his good faith belief
that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this
article and a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the
amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that he has not met
that standard or if it is ultimately determined that indemnification of the
director against expenses incurred by him in connection with that proceeding is
prohibited by Section E of this article. This provision shall be deemed to
constitute authorization of that payment or reimbursement.

L. The written undertaking required by Section K of this article must be an
unlimited general obligation of the director but need not be secured. It may be
accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

M. This article shall be valid only to the extent it is consistent with
applicable law as limited by these articles of incorporation, if such a
limitation exists.

N. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the Company may pay or
reimburse
<PAGE>
expenses incurred by a director in connection with his appearance as a witness
or other participation in a proceeding at a time when he is not a named
defendant or respondent in the proceeding.

O. An officer of the Company shall be indemnified as, and to the same extent,
provided by Sections H, I, and J of this article for a director and is entitled
to seek indemnification under those sections to the same extent as a director.
The Company may indemnify and advance expenses to an officer, employee, or agent
of the Company to the same extent that it may indemnify and advance expenses to
directors under this article.

P. The Company may indemnify and advance expenses to a person who is not or was
not an officer, employee, or agent of the Company but who is or was serving at
the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner, venturer,
proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign
or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust,
employee benefit plan, or other enterprise to the same extent that it may
indemnify and advance expenses to directors under this article.

Q. The Company may indemnify and advance expenses to an officer, employee,
agent, or person identified in Section P of this article and who is not a
director to such further extent, consistent with law, as may be provided by its
bylaws, general or specific action of its board of directors, or contract or as
permitted or required by common law.

R. (1) The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company or who is
or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner,
venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of
another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against him and incurred by him in such a capacity or arising
out of his status as such a person, whether or not the Company would have the
power to indemnify him against that liability under this article.

(2)(a) In addition to the powers described in Subsection (1), the Company may
purchase, maintain, or enter into other arrangements on behalf of any person who
is or was a director, officer, or trustee of the Company against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in such capacity or arising out of his
status as such a person, whether or not the Company would have the power to
indemnify him against that liability under this article.

(b) If the other arrangement is with a person or entity that is not regularly
engaged in the business of providing insurance coverage, the arrangement may
provide for payment of a liability with respect to which the Company would not
have the power to indemnify a person only if coverage for that liability has
been approved by the Company's members.

(c) Without limiting the power of the Company to procure or maintain any kind of
other arrangement, the Company, for the benefit of persons described in
Subsection (2)(a) may:

(i) create a trust fund;

(ii) establish any form of self-insurance;

(iii) secure its indemnity obligation by grant of a security interest or other
lien on the assets of the Company; or

(iv) establish a letter of credit, guaranty, or surety arrangement.

(3) The insurance may be procured or maintained with an insurer, or the other
arrangement may be procured, maintained, or established within the Company or
with any insurer or other person considered appropriate by the board of
directors, regardless of whether all or part of the stock or other securities of
the insurer or other person are owned in whole or part by the Company. In the
absence of fraud, the judgment of the board of directors as to the terms and
conditions of the insurance or other arrangement and the identity of the insurer
or other person participating in an arrangement is conclusive, and the insurance
or arrangement is not voidable and does not subject
<PAGE>
the directors approving the insurance or arrangement to liability, on any
ground, regardless of whether directors participating in the approval are
beneficiaries of the insurance or arrangement.

S. For purposes of this article, the Company is deemed to have requested a
director to serve an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by him of
his duties to the Company also imposes duties on or otherwise involves services
by him to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan. Excise taxes
assessed on a director with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to
applicable law are deemed fines. Action taken or omitted by him with respect to
an employee benefit plan in the performance of his duties for a purpose
reasonably believed by him to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of the plan is deemed to be for a purpose which is not opposed to
the best interests of the Company.

                                   ARTICLE VII

A director of the Company shall not be held liable to the Company or its members
for monetary damages for any act or omission in the director's capacity as a
director, except to the extent that exculpation from liability is not permitted
under Texas law as in effect at the time such liability is determined.

Directors consisting of not less than five members of the Company, the exact
number to be determined from time to time by vote of a majority of the whole
Board, who shall be elected annually by the members and shall hold office until
their successors are elected and qualified, or until their death, resignation,
or removal. At least sixty days prior to the annual meeting of the Company, the
Board shall nominate candidates for the office of director to succeed the
directors whose term of office will expire on the date of such annual meeting
and shall thereupon file the names of such candidates with the secretary. At
least one thousand of the members may also nominate candidates to succeed the
directors whose term of office will expire on the date of such annual meeting by
filing with the secretary at least sixty days before such meeting a certificate
signed and acknowledged by each of such members setting forth the full names and
addresses of such members and giving the names and addresses of the candidates
nominated and by filing with such certificate the written acceptance of such
nominations by each nominee named in such certificate. No person shall be
eligible for election as a director unless nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth above. The names of all candidates shall be made known by
the secretary to any member upon written request of such member. Any vacancy in
the Board may be filled for the unexpired term by a majority of the remaining
directors, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The Board
of Directors may, by contract or otherwise, give general or limited or special
power and authority to the officers and employees of the Company to transact the
general business or any special business of the Company, and may give powers of
attorney to agents of the Company to transact any special business requiring
such authorization.

      Section B. The entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be
removed from office with or without cause by vote of a majority of the members
of the Company, at any regular or special meeting of such members of the
Company.

      Section C. All meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the
home office of the Company or at any such place within or without the State of
Texas as may be designated from time to time by resolution of the Board or by
written consent of all the directors. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be held, without call or notice, immediately following each annual meeting
of the members of the Company, and at such times as the directors may determine.
Special meetings of the Board of Directors for any purpose shall be called at
any time by the President or, if he is absent or unable or refuses to act, by
any Vice President or any two directors. Notice of the special meeting, stating
the time, and in general terms the purpose thereof, shall be given in writing to
each director either personally or by mail or other means of written
communication no later than two days before the day selected for the meeting.
<PAGE>
      Section D. A majority of the directors shall be necessary to constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. Every act or decision done or made by a
majority of the directors shall be regarded as the act of the Board of
Directors, unless a greater number is required by law or by the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company. Any action required or permitted to be taken by
the Board of Directors, may be taken without a meeting, and with the same force
and effect as a unanimous vote of directors, if all directors individually or
collectively consent in writing to such action.

      Section E. The President, or in his absence, any director selected by the
directors present, shall preside at meetings of the Board of Directors. The
Secretary of the Company shall act as Secretary at meetings of the Board of
Directors.

      Section F. Directors and members of committees appointed by the Board of
Directors may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, and such
reimbursement for expenses, as may be fixed or determined by the Board of
Directors.

                                    OFFICERS

      Section A. The officers of the Company shall be a President, a Vice
President and such additional Vice Presidents as the Board of Directors shall
elect with such special duties, if any, as the Board of Directors shall
determine, a Secretary and such Assistant Secretaries as the Board of Directors
shall elect with such special duties, if any, as the Board of Directors shall
determine, a Treasurer and such Assistant Treasurers as the Board of Directors
shall elect, with such special duties, if any, as the Board of Directors shall
determine. Any two offices mentioned above may be combined and held by one
person, except the offices of president and secretary.

      Section B The President of the Company shall be the chief executive
officer and manager of the Company, shall preside at all meetings of the
directors and of the Membership, shall sign all policies, subject to the
condition that his signature may be in facsimile if the policies are
countersigned at time of issuance by a person or persons designated to
countersign under rules established by the Board of Directors or the President,
and shall perform all such other duties and shall have all such other powers and
authority as may in any way reasonably pertain to and be exercised by the chief
executive officer of a company.

      Any person appearing as the primary insured in a policy shall, while any
such policy is in force, be a member of the Company. As used in these Bylaws,
"policy" shall mean any policy or contract of insurance (other than a
reinsurance contract), including any binder or renewal certificate issued in the
course of business and not terminated.

                                   ARTICLE VI

above date of the regular annual meeting. No other notice of the regular annual
meeting of the members shall be necessary.
<PAGE>
      Section C. Notice of special meetings of the members must be given to all
members at least ten (10) days prior to the date of any such special meeting but
no more than fifty (50) days before such meeting. Notwithstanding the
immediately foregoing, if the Company shall have more than one thousand (1,000)
members entitled to vote, the Company may give notice of such special meeting by
publication in any newspaper of general circulation in the community in which
the principal office of the Company is located.

      Section D. Special meetings of the members may be held at the call of the
President, the General Manager, one-third of the Directors of the Company, or by
members having not less than one-tenth (1/10) of the votes entitled to be cast
at such meeting.

      Section E. Voting at either the regular annual meeting or at special
meetings may be either in person or by proxy. All policies of the Company shall
contain a provision in substance providing that each member or policyholder
appoints the President of the Company, with full power of substitution, to be
his lawful attorney-in-fact and in his absence that said attorney-in-fact is
authorized and empowered to vote for him at any meeting unless the member gives
notice to the contrary, in writing, to the Company prior to any such meeting.
Provided also, that applications for Company's insurance may, at the will of the
Board of Directors, contain a substantially similar provision. Provided also,
that such appointment, whether accomplished in the policy and/or in the
application, shall be binding upon each policyholder and shall effectively grant
to the President of the Company, with full power of substitution, the right to
vote as the proxy of each such member or policyholder, at any regular annual
meeting or special meeting of the members of the Company on all matters which
come before any such meeting when any member or policyholder does not attend the
meeting, but subject to the right of each policyholder to give notice to the
contrary, in writing, to the Company prior to any such meeting or meetings.
Provided however, that no such proxy however granted shall prevent any member or
policyholder from casting his individual vote on all matters which come before
any such meeting at which he is attending.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                    RESERVES

      The Company shall maintain at all times such unearned premium reserves and
other reserves as may be required by law, and the Board of Directors may
authorize any other type of reserves.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                           POLICIES ISSUED BY COMPANY

      Section A. Policy forms used by the Company for insurance risks it is
authorized to assume shall conform to applicable laws and rules and regulations
of the Texas Department of Insurance. Policy forms shall also include the
conventionally required provisions that policies are issued subject to the

so filed by the Company may provide for premium payment schedules on a monthly,
quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis or for any other term not exceeding five
years.

      Section C. No policy shall be issued to provide a greater amount of
insurance for any one hazard than the amount of statutory deposit posted by the
Company with the State Treasurer of Texas, unless at the time of issuance of the
policy the Company has in force a valid contract of reinsurance for the excess
risk.

      Section D. No member shall be liable to any assessment by the Company.

paid in accordance with the terms of the policy and in accordance with the
applicable laws of the State of Texas and any rules and regulations promulgated

      These Bylaws may be amended at any annual meeting of the members of the
Company or at any meeting called for that purpose. These Bylaws may also be
amended by unanimous vote of the Board of Directors at any meeting called for
that purpose. Any amendment by the Board of Directors shall be presented for
ratification at the next annual meeting of the members. Notice of the meeting,
whether regular or special, at which amendments to these Bylaws are to be
considered, shall be mailed or delivered personally to all members. If required
by law at the time of the amendment, amendments to these Bylaws shall not be
effective until approved by the Texas Department of Insurance as being in
conformity with applicable law.

Berkeley Management Corporation
175 Berkeley Street
Boston, Massachusetts 02117
Attn:  General Counsel

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 6.8 of the
Acquisition Agreement dated _________, 2002 (the "Purchase Agreement"), among
GAINSCO Service Corp., a Texas corporation ("Seller"), and GAINSCO, Inc., a
Texas corporation that is the parent company of Seller ("GAINSCO")
(collectively, "Sellers"), Berkeley Management Corporation, a Texas corporation
("Purchaser"), Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, a Massachusetts stock insurance
company ("Liberty") and GAINSCO County Mutual Insurance Company, a Texas county
mutual insurance company (the "Company"). Capitalized terms defined in the
Purchase Agreement are used herein with the same meaning unless otherwise
defined herein.

                               DOCUMENTS EXAMINED

         In our capacity as counsel for the Sellers, we have examined the
originals, copies or forms, certified or otherwise identified to our
satisfaction, of the following documents:

                  (i) the Purchase Agreement;

                  (ii) the Liability Assumption Agreement of even date herewith
between the Company and GAINSCO (the "Liability Assumption Agreement");

                  (iii) the Assignment Agreement of even date herewith among

                  (iv) the 100% Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement dated

                  (v) the Management Agreement dated October 12, 1992 by and
between the Company and Seller (the "Management Agreement");

                  (vi) the Articles of Incorporation of each of the Company,
GAINSCO and Seller; and

                  (vii) the Bylaws of each of the Company, GAINSCO and Seller.


<PAGE>


         In addition, we have examined and relied upon such certificates of
public officials and other certificates, corporate minutes, opinions and
instruments as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for our opinion
hereinafter set forth. As to matters of fact material to our opinion, we have,
when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the
foregoing certificates of representatives of the Sellers and representations and
warranties set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Liability Assumption
Agreement, the Assignment Agreement and the Reinsurance Agreement (collectively,
the "Agreements"), and have not conducted any special inquiry or investigation
in respect of such matters.

                                   ASSUMPTIONS

         In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent and
without any independent investigation, all of the following:

         (A) the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic original
documents of all documents submitted as certified, conformed or photostatic
copies;

         (B) that each of the parties to the Agreements other than the Sellers
(the "Other Parties") is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and has full
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each
of the Agreements to which it is a party, that each of the Agreements has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the parties thereto, that
each of the Agreements constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of
each of the Other Parties thereto and is enforceable against the Other Parties
in accordance with its terms that each of the Other Parties has fulfilled and
complied with its obligations under the Agreements to the extent required
thereunder to date, and that the Sellers have received or will concurrently
herewith receive the consideration provided in the Agreements to be received at
or prior to the date hereof;

         (C) that all of the Agreements will be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms thereof; and

         (D) that the representations and warranties as to factual matters
contained in the Agreements are true and correct.

                                     OPINION

         Based upon the foregoing and having due regard for the legal
considerations we deem relevant, and subject to the further qualifications and
limitations hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that:

         1. Each of the Sellers is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas, and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform the Agreements
to which it is a party and all transactions and agreements contemplated therein
to which it is a party.


                                        2

<PAGE>


         2. Each of the Agreements to which Sellers or the Company is a party
has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the
Sellers and the Company, as the case may be, and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each of the Sellers and the Company, as the case may be,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, in each case except as
enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject to general equity principles
and to limitations on availability of equitable relief including specific
performance.

         3. The Company is a county mutual insurance company authorized and
formed under Chapter 17 of the Texas Insurance Code and currently holds a valid
certificate of authority and corporate charter to do the business of insurance
described therein, and has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into and perform the Agreements to which it is a party and all transactions and
agreements contemplated therein to which it is a party.

         4. The execution and delivery of the Agreements and consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby will not result in the breach of, or
constitute a default under, the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the
Sellers and the Company or the Management Agreement.

         5. The Management Agreement is a valid, binding and enforceable
agreement that, to our knowledge, is in full force and effect, and, to our
knowledge, Seller is not in breach or default thereof

         6. Except for the approval of the Texas Department of Insurance which,
to our knowledge, has been obtained and is final and in effect (as set forth in
Commissioner's Order No. ___________, dated___________, 2002), no approval,
license or permit of any governmental body or officer of the State of Texas is
required in order to consummate the Purchaser's acquisition of the Management
Agreement in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.

                     FURTHER QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS

         The opinions expressed above are expressly subject to the following
qualifications and limitations:

         (a) The enforceability of the Agreements and all transactions and

principles and limitations on the availability of equitable remedies, as such,
in connection with the enforcement of rights granted under such documents,
including but not limited to specific performance, or as to the effects of the
application of principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
considered in proceedings in law or in equity). We express no opinion as to (i)
the specific remedy that any Governmental Entity might grant in connection with
the enforcement of rights under any of the Agreements and all transactions and
agreements contemplated therein or (ii) the effect of any antitrust,
environmental, securities or tax laws.

         (b) We express no opinion herein as to the validity or enforceability
of(i) any provisions purporting to entitle a party to indemnification in respect
of any matters arising in whole or in part by reason of any illegal, wrongful or
negligent act or omission of such party, (ii) any provisions that

                                        3

purport to restrict access to or waive remedies or defenses, to waive any rights
to notices or to establish evidentiary standards, (iii) any provisions relating

facts, (ii) we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine
the existence or absence of such facts and (iii) no inference as to our

relates only to the laws of the State of Texas and the federal laws of the
United States, and we express no opinion with regard to any matters that may be
governed or affected by any other laws.

         (e) This opinion is limited solely to the matters stated herein and no
opinion is to be inferred or may be implied beyond the matters expressly stated
herein.

         The opinions expressed herein are solely for your benefit in connection

OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR PURCHASER

GAINSCO, INC.
GAINSCO Service Corp.
500 Commerce Street
Fort Worth, Texas 76102

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Acquisition
Agreement dated ___, 2002 (the "Agreement"), among GAINSCO Service Corp., a
Texas corporation ("Seller"), and GAINSCO, INC., a Texas corporation that is the
parent company of Seller ("GAINSCO") (collectively, "Sellers"), Berkeley
Management Corporation, a Texas corporation ("Purchaser"), Liberty Mutual
Insurance Company, a Massachusetts stock insurance company ("Liberty"), and
GAINSCO County Mutual Insurance Company, a Texas county mutual insurance company
(the "Company"). Capitalized terms defined in the Agreement are used herein with
the same meaning unless otherwise defined herein.

We have examined the documents listed in Exhibit "A" attached to this opinion
letter (despite any contrary definition contained in the Agreement, the
"TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS"). We have also examined those certificates and other
documents listed in Exhibit "B" attached to this opinion letter (the "DUE
DILIGENCE DOCUMENTS"). We have made no other investigations or inquiry.

We have made no special investigation or review of any laws, rules, regulations,
judgments, decrees, franchises, certificates, permits or the like, other than a
review of the Due Diligence Documents and the Included Laws, as defined below.

We have relied as to factual matters solely on the following, each of which we
have assumed, without independent investigation, to be true, correct and
complete: (i) Purchaser's representations and warranties set forth in the
Transaction Documents, (ii) certificates of the officers of Purchaser, and (iii)
the Due Diligence Documents.

We have been retained by Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated in the Agreement, and while we have no current actual knowledge of
anything that would cause our opinion set forth below to be untrue, it is
expressly acknowledged that we have not represented Purchaser prior to this
engagement, and do not have knowledge of legal issues related to Purchaser's
actions prior to that date.

You are hereby notified that (i) we do not consider you to be our client in the
transaction to which this opinion letter relates, (ii) neither the Disciplinary
Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility governing members of the State
Bar of Texas nor current case law clearly articulates the circumstances under
which an attorney may give a legal opinion to a person other than the attorney's
own client, (iii) a court might determine that it is improper for us to issue,
and for you to rely upon, a legal opinion issued by us when we have acted as
counsel to Purchaser in connection with its execution and delivery of the
Agreement, and (iv) you may wish to obtain a legal opinion from your own legal
counsel as to the matters addressed in this opinion letter. Furthermore,
<PAGE>

Purchaser has not waived, nor should anything be construed as a waiver of, the
attorney-client privilege as to any communications between Purchaser and us (or
any other legal counsel for Purchaser) or with respect to any attorney work
product in connection with its execution and delivery of the Agreement or any
other matter.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other assumptions,
qualifications, exceptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion
that:

1.    Purchaser is a corporation, validly existing and in good standing under
      the laws of the state of Texas.

2.    Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
      and perform the Transaction Documents and all transactions and agreements
      contemplated therein.

3.    The Transaction Documents and all transactions and agreements contemplated
      therein have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Purchaser,
      and constitute valid and binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable
      against Purchaser in accordance with their terms.

Our opinions expressed herein are further qualified and limited as follows.
These specific qualifications, limitations, exceptions and assumptions are in
addition to and do not supersede or limit the qualifications and limitations
contained elsewhere herein.

      A. We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
Included Laws. We have made no special investigation or review of any published
constitutions, treaties, laws, rules or regulations or judicial or
administrative decisions ("LAWS"), other than a review of the Laws of the State
of Texas. For purposes of this opinion, the term "INCLUDED LAWS" means the Laws
described in the preceding sentence and specifically excludes (i) Laws of any
counties, cities, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions and

OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR LIBERTY

GAINSCO, INC.
GAINSCO Service Corp.
500 Commerce Street
Fort Worth, Texas 76102

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Acquisition
Agreement dated ___, 2002 (the "Agreement"), among GAINSCO Service Corp., a
Texas corporation ("Seller"), and GAINSCO, INC., a Texas corporation that is the
parent company of Seller ("GAINSCO") (collectively, "Sellers"), Berkeley
Management Corporation, a Texas corporation ("Purchaser"), Liberty Mutual
Insurance Company, a Massachusetts stock insurance company ("Liberty"), and
GAINSCO County Mutual Insurance Company, a Texas county mutual insurance company
(the "Company"). Capitalized terms defined in the Agreement are used herein with
the same meaning unless otherwise defined herein.

I have examined the documents listed in Exhibit "A" attached to this opinion
letter (despite any contrary definition contained in the Agreement, the
"TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS"). I have also examined those certificates and other
documents listed in Exhibit "B" attached to this opinion letter (the "DUE
DILIGENCE DOCUMENTS"). I have made no other investigations or inquiry.

I have made no special investigation or review of any laws, rules, regulations,
judgments, decrees, franchises, certificates, permits or the like, other than a
review of the Due Diligence Documents and the Included Laws, as defined below.

I have relied as to factual matters solely on the following, each of which I
have assumed, without independent investigation, to be true, correct and
complete: (i) Liberty's representations and warranties set forth in the
Transaction Documents, (ii) certificates of the officers of Liberty, and (iii)
the Due Diligence Documents.

You are hereby notified that (i) I do not consider you to be my client in the
transaction to which this opinion letter relates, (ii) neither applicable rules
of professional conduct governing members of the Board of Bar Overseers of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts nor current case law clearly articulates the
circumstances under which an attorney may give a legal opinion to a person other
than the attorney's own client, (iii) a court might determine that it is
improper for me to issue, and for you to rely upon, a legal opinion issued by me
when I have acted as counsel to Liberty in connection with its execution and
delivery of the Agreement, and (iv) you may wish to obtain a legal opinion from
your own legal counsel as to the matters addressed in this opinion letter.
Furthermore, Liberty has not waived, nor should anything be construed as a
waiver of, the attorney-client privilege as to any communications between
Liberty and me (or any other legal counsel for Liberty) or with respect to any
attorney work product in connection with its execution and delivery of the
Agreement or any other matter.
<PAGE>
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the other assumptions,
qualifications, exceptions and limitations stated herein, I am of the opinion
that:

1.    Liberty is a corporation, validly existing and in good standing under the
      laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2.    Liberty has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and
      perform the Transaction Documents and all transactions and agreements
      contemplated therein.

3.    The Transaction Documents and all transactions and agreements contemplated
      therein have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Liberty, and
      constitute valid and binding obligations of Liberty, enforceable against
      Liberty in accordance with their terms.

The opinions expressed herein are further qualified and limited as follows.
These specific qualifications, limitations, exceptions and assumptions are in
addition to and do not supersede or limit the qualifications and limitations
contained elsewhere herein.

      A. I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
Included Laws. I have made no special investigation or review of any published
constitutions, treaties, laws, rules or regulations or judicial or
administrative decisions ("LAWS"), other than a review of the Laws of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. For purposes of this opinion, the term "INCLUDED
LAWS" means the Laws described in the preceding sentence and specifically
excludes (i) Laws of any counties, cities, towns, municipalities and special
political subdivisions and any agencies thereof, (ii) Laws relating to land use,
zoning and building code issues, taxes, ERISA, environmental issues,
intellectual property Laws, securities Laws (including without limitation state
securities and "blue sky" Laws) and antitrust issues.

      B. This letter and the matters addressed herein are as of the date hereof
or such earlier date as is specified herein, and I undertake no, and hereby
disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in any matter set forth
herein, whether based on a change in the law, a change in any fact relating to
Liberty, or any other person or entity, or any other circumstance. This opinion
letter is limited to the matters expressly stated herein and no opinions are to
be inferred or may be implied beyond the opinions expressly set forth herein.

      C. The opinion expressed in Paragraph 1 above is given solely on the basis
of the Certificates listed in Exhibit "B", item 3, and speaks only as of the
date indicated thereon rather than as of the date hereof. Such opinion is
limited to the meaning ascribed to such certificates by each applicable State
agency and applicable law.

      D. I express no opinion as to (i) the financial condition or solvency of
Liberty, (ii) the ability (financial or otherwise) of Liberty or any other party
to meet their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents, and (iii)
the compliance of the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby with, or as to the effect on any of the foregoing of, antifraud
provisions of the federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations.

      E. This letter is solely for the benefit of Sellers, and no other persons
or entities shall be entitled to rely upon this letter. Without my prior written
consent, this letter may not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise
<PAGE>
referred to in any document and may not be furnished or otherwise disclosed to

closing file, and (iii) after written notice to me, use hereof in any legal
proceeding arising out of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents filed against any addressee hereof.

      F. I render no opinion with respect to the accuracy or adequacy of any
disclosure made by Liberty to you, including, without limitation, any
representations, warranties or exhibits to the Agreement. I render no opinion
with respect to compliance with any state securities or blue sky statutes or
regulations.

      G. The opinions expressed in this letter are subject to and qualified and
limited by: (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer and
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights and remedies generally including court decisions interpreting such Laws;
(ii) general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of

      Re:   Acquisition Agreement between GAINSCO Service Corp. and GAINSCO,
            Inc. ("Sellers"), Berkeley Management Corporation ("Purchaser") and
            Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty") regarding the
            Acquisition of Control of GAINSCO County Mutual Insurance Company
            (the "Company") dated July ___, 2002 (the "Acquisition Agreement")

Dear Sirs:

      The undersigned are duly authorized representatives of OMNI Insurance
Company ("OMNI") and Omni General Agency, Inc. ("OMNI MGA"), and they provide
this letter with the understanding that it will be relied upon by Purchaser and
Liberty in consummating the transactions contemplated in the Acquisition
Agreement. OMNI and OMNI MGA acknowledge the receipt and sufficiency of good and
valuable consideration in exchange for the covenants and agreements provided
herein.

      OMNI and the Company are parties to a 100% Quota Share Reinsurance
Agreement dated as of July 24, 1995, as amended (the "Reinsurance Agreement").
The Reinsurance Agreement reinsures all business produced by OMNI MGA, a wholly
owned subsidiary of OMNI Insurance Company, pursuant to the terms of that
certain Agency Agreement dated July 24, 1995 (the "General Agency Agreement").
The financial obligations of OMNI under the Reinsurance Agreement are secured by
the terms of a certain Trust Agreement dated August 8, 1995, which was amended
and restated as of May ___, 2002 (the "Trust Agreement"). The financial
obligations of OMNI MGA are guaranteed by OMNI Insurance Company pursuant to a
letter of guaranty dated July 13, 1995 (the "Guaranty"). The Reinsurance
Agreement, the General Agency Agreement, the Guaranty and the Trust Agreement
are referred to herein as the "Fronting Agreements."

      OMNI and OMNI MGA agree that the transactions contemplated in the
Acquisition Agreement shall have no effect upon the financial security and
guarantees provided by or on behalf of OMNI and/or OMNI MGA in connection with
the Reinsurance Agreement and the General Agency Agreement. From the date of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Acquisition Agreement, the
Company shall continue to have the same rights, remedies, interests, and
obligations under the Fronting Agreements, and OMNI and OMNI MGA shall continue
to honor and perform any and all terms, conditions, covenants and agreements
contained in the Fronting Agreements. OMNI and OMNI MGA further acknowledge that
the Fronting Agreements are and shall remain in full force and effect, valid and
enforceable against the parties in accordance with their terms, notwithstanding
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Acquisition Agreement,
and without prejudice to, or causing any adverse effect upon, the rights of the
Company under or with respect to its rights, remedies and interests under the
Fronting Agreements. Furthermore, the change of the Company's name, the
amendment of its charter and bylaws, as well as the assignment of the Management
Contract pertaining to the Company, shall have no effect upon the Company's
rights, remedies, interests and obligations under the Fronting Agreements.
<PAGE>
      To OMNI's and OMNI MGA's knowledge, the Company is not in default of any
provision of the Fronting Agreements and has committed no breach or repudiation
with respect thereto. Notwithstanding Section VII.I. thereof, nor any other term
to the contrary set forth therein, the General Agency Agreement has remained
continuously in effect from July 24, 1995, as amended on April 1, 1996, through
January 31, 2002, when it was terminated in accordance with its terms. All
terms, conditions, covenants and agreements of the General Agency Agreement
remained valid and enforceable against the parties thereto through January 31,
2002, and all such terms, conditions, covenants and agreements which were to
survive the termination of such agreement (as required by the terms thereof)
remain valid and enforceable against the parties thereto as of the date hereof.
OMNI MGA agrees that, in no event, nor under any circumstances, shall it claim
or assert that the General Agency Agreement terminated, was cancelled or expired
prior to January 31, 2002.

      OMNI and OMNI MGA acknowledge that neither they nor any of their officers,
directors, agents, employees or representatives have any rights or interests
with respect to the management and control of the Company nor with respect to
any voting interest pertaining to the affairs of the Company. Furthermore, the
Company's applications for insurance utilized by OMNI and OMNI MGA or their
agents or representatives include a proxy granting to the President or Vice
President of the Company the right to vote on behalf of the policyholder at any
meeting of the policyholders of the Company. Each policyholder solicited by
OMNI, OMNI MGA, or their agents or representatives has signed such an
application. Upon request by the Company or Purchaser, OMNI shall produce copies
of all proxies granted by the policyholders solicited by OMNI, OMNI MGA or their
agents or representatives.

      The statements made herein are made as of the date first set forth above
for the benefit of Purchaser and Liberty. The statements may not be used or
relied upon by any other person or entity.

                                     Sincerely,

exchange for the covenants and agreements provided herein.

      Met P&C and the Company are parties to a 100% Quota Share Reinsurance

financial obligations of Met P&C under the Reinsurance Agreement are secured by
a certain Letter of Credit issued by Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. dated April 25,
1996, as amended (the "Letter of Credit"). The obligations of Met MGA are
guaranteed by Met P&C pursuant to that certain Guaranty and Indemnity Agreement
dated April 24, 1996 (the "Guaranty"). The Reinsurance Agreement, the General
Agency Agreement, the Guaranty and the Letter of Credit are referred to herein

upon, the rights of the Company under or with respect to its rights, remedies
and interests under the Fronting Agreements. Furthermore, the change of the
Company's name, the amendment of its charter and bylaws, as well as the
assignment of the Management Contract pertaining to the Company, shall have no
effect upon the Company's rights, remedies, interests and obligations under the

      To Met P&C's and Met MGA's knowledge, the Company is not in default of any
provision of the Fronting Agreements and has committed no breach or repudiation
with respect thereto. Notwithstanding Section VII.I. thereof, nor any other term
to the contrary set forth therein, the General Agency Agreement has remained
continuously in effect from May 1, 1996 to the present, and the parties agree it
shall continue in force until terminated in accordance with Section V,

interests with respect to the management and control of the Company nor with
respect to any voting interest pertaining to the affairs of the Company.
Furthermore, the Company's applications for insurance utilized by Met P&C and

certain Post Closing Payments to Seller; (ii) Sellers have agreed to indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to certain matters, and (iii)
Purchaser may, under certain circumstances and from time to time beginning after

Acquisition Agreement by depositing all or a portion of a Post Closing Payment
(in an amount equal to the amount of the Loss alleged to have been incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties) that otherwise would be payable to Seller
into an escrow account to be held by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Account"),
all as more particularly set forth in the Acquisition Agreement; and

      WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to establish the Escrow Account and to
make certain provisions related thereto.

      NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                              TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      1.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW ACCOUNT. The parties hereto hereby establish
the Escrow Account with the Escrow Agent. Any amounts that may be deposited into
the Escrow Account by Purchaser from time to time, if any, are referred to
herein as the "Escrowed Funds".

      1.2 TREATMENT OF ESCROWED FUNDS. The monies constituting the Escrowed
Funds shall be deposited from time to time and maintained in a segregated,
interest-bearing account pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

      1.3 INTEREST. Any and all interest earned with respect to the Escrowed

                                   ARTICLE II
                          PROVISIONS AS TO ESCROW AGENT

      2.1 LIMITATION OF ESCROW AGENT'S CAPACITY.

            A. This Agreement expressly and exclusively sets forth the duties of
      Escrow Agent with respect to any and all matters pertinent hereto, and no
      implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against
      Escrow Agent. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the
      Escrow Agent and the other parties hereto in connection with the subject
      matter of this escrow, and no other agreement entered into among the
      parties, or any of them, shall be considered as adopted or binding, in
      whole or in part upon the Escrow Agent notwithstanding that any such other
      agreement may be deposited with the Escrow Agent or the Escrow Agent may
      have knowledge thereof.

            B. Escrow Agent acts hereunder as a depository only, and is not
      responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the sufficiency,
      correctness, genuineness or validity of the subject matter of this
      Agreement or any part thereof, or for the form of execution thereof, or
      for the identify or authority of any person executing or depositing such
      subject matter except as provided in Section 1.4 hereof. Escrow Agent
      shall in no way be responsible for notifying, nor shall it be its duty to
      notify, any party hereto or any other party interested in this Agreement
      of any payment required or maturity occurring under this Agreement or
      under the terms of any instrument deposited herewith.

      2.2 AUTHORITY TO ACT.

            A. Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed by the undersigned
      to deliver the Escrowed Funds only in accordance with the provisions of
      Article I of this Agreement.

            B. In the event that Escrow Agent shall, in good faith, be in doubt
      as to what action it should take hereunder, Escrow Agent may, at its
      option, refuse to comply with any claims or demands on it, or refuse to
      take any other action hereunder, so long as such doubt exists, and in any
      such event, Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable in any way or to
      any person for its failure or refusal to act, and Escrow Agent shall be
      entitled to continue to refrain from acting until (i) the rights of all
      interested parties shall have been fully and finally adjudicated by a
      court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) all disagreements shall have been
      resolved and all doubt resolved by agreement among all of the interested
      persons, and


                                       2
<PAGE>
      Escrow Agent shall have been notified thereof in writing signed by all
      such persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall obey
      the order, judgment, decree or levy of any court, whether with or without
      jurisdiction, or of any agency of the United States or any political
      subdivision thereof, or of any agency of the State of Texas or of any
      political subdivision thereof. The rights of Escrow Agent under this
      sub-paragraph are cumulative of all other rights which it may have by law
      or otherwise.

            C. In the event that any controversy should arise among the parties
      with respect to this Agreement, or should the Escrow Agent resign and the
      parties fail to select another Escrow Agent to act in its stead, the
      Escrow Agent shall have the right to institute a bill of interpleader in
      any court of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the
      parties.

      2.3 COMPENSATION/INDEMNIFICATION.

            A. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation as set forth in
      Exhibit "A" attached hereto and incorporated herein (the "Fee") as well as
      reimbursement for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
      with the performance by it of service under this Agreement (including
      reasonable fees and expenses of Escrow Agent's counsel). The Fee shall be
      paid by Purchaser and Seller, split equally between them. All
      reimbursements for Escrow Agent's reasonable costs and expenses as set
      forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid by Purchaser and
      Seller, split equally between them.

            B. The parties to this Agreement (other than Escrow Agent) hereby
      jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless
      from all losses, costs, claims, demands, expenses, damages, and attorney's
      fees suffered or incurred by Escrow Agent as a result of anything which it
      may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or any
      litigation or cause of action arising from or in conjunction with this
      Agreement or involving the Escrowed Funds, except that this
      indemnification shall not apply to the willful misconduct or gross
      negligence of the Escrow Agent. This indemnity shall include, but not be
      limited to, all costs incurred in conjunction with any interpleader action
      brought by the Escrow Agent regarding this Agreement.

      2.4 MISCELLANEOUS.

            A. Escrow Agent may resign at any time by giving sixty (60) days
      prior written notice to the other parties hereto, whereupon the other
      parties hereto will immediately appoint a successor Escrow Agent.

            B. All representations, covenants, and indemnification obligations
      contained in this Article II shall survive the termination of this
      Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                  Voting Rights


The Company proxy is included either in the application form itself or as a form
accompanying the application (See Schedule 2.22). Policyholders grant their
right to vote at any meeting of the policyholders of the Company under the
proxy.

Of 305 policies in force under the GAINSCO Fronting Arrangement, as of July 26,
2002, at least 55% of these policies are signed by the policyholder and grant
the proxy as indicated.

The Company has been informed by Metropolitan that Metropolitan currently does
not have signed proxies for a majority of its policies in force and that not all
of the applications for policies in force include a form of proxy.

The representations in Section 2.32 and this Schedule 2.32, as regards policies
issued and in force and related proxies under the Third Party Fronting
Arrangements, rely solely on oral or verbal representations from Metropolitan
and OMNI. Neither Sellers nor the Company have made any independent
investigation in this regard.
