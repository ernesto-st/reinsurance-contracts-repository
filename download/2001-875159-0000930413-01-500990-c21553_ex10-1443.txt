       1.     AUTHORIZATION OF NOTES AND GUARANTEE.

       The Company has authorized the issue and sale of $255,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of its 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes due April 12, 2011 (the
"NOTES," such term to include any such notes issued in substitution therefor
pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement or the Other Agreements (as hereinafter
defined)). The Notes shall be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1A,
with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by you and the Company.
Each of XL Capital, XL Insurance and XL Re has authorized the unconditional and
irrevocable guarantee of the Notes (the "GUARANTEE"). The Guarantee shall be

name in Schedule A at the purchase price of 100% of the principal amount

obligation hereunder and the obligations of the Other Purchasers under the Other

closing (the "CLOSING") on April 12, 2001 or on such other Business Day
thereafter on or prior to April 30, 2001 as may be agreed upon by the Company

shall fail to tender such Notes to you as provided above in this Section 3, or
any of the conditions specified in Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to
your reasonable satisfaction or shall not have been waived by you, you shall, at
your election, be relieved of all further obligations under this Agreement,
without thereby waiving any rights you may have by reason of such failure or
such nonfulfillment.

       4.     CONDITIONS TO CLOSING.

the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to your reasonable satisfaction, prior

       5.1    ORGANIZATION; POWER AND AUTHORITY.

              The Company and each Guarantor is a corporation or company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation, or in the case of XL Insurance, its jurisdiction of
continuation, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law,
other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Guarantor has
the corporate power and authority to own or hold under lease the material
properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it
transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Agreement, the
Other Agreements, the Notes and the Guarantee, as applicable, and to perform the

       5.2    AUTHORIZATION, ETC.

              This Agreement, the Other Agreements, the Notes and the Guarantee
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and the Guarantors, as applicable, and this Agreement constitutes, and,
upon execution and delivery thereof, each Other Agreement, each Note and the
Guarantee will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
and each Guarantor, as applicable, enforceable against the Company and each
Guarantor, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

              5.3    DISCLOSURE.

              The Company, through its agents, Lehman Brothers Inc. and Banc of
America Securities LLC, has delivered to you and each Other Purchaser a copy of
a Private Placement Memorandum, dated March 2001 (the "MEMORANDUM"), relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.3, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement and the related schedules
thereto, the Memorandum (other than the materials and information set forth
under the caption "Preliminary Summary of Terms" and in Appendices A, G, H and I
thereof, including, without limitation any reports or other statements prepared
by third parties), the documents, certificates or other writings identified in
Schedule 5.3 and the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a
whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed in
the Memorandum or as expressly described in Schedule 5.3, or in one of the
documents, certificates or other writings identified therein, or in the
financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 2000, there has
been no change in the financial condition, operations, business or properties of
the Company, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries except
changes that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

       stock or similar equity interests outstanding owned directly or
       indirectly by XL Capital. XL Capital does not hold directly or indirectly
       in partnerships, associations or other similar non-corporate entities any
       amounts of assets or business which, in the aggregate, would be Material.

              (b)    All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar

       by XL Capital, directly or indirectly, have been validly issued, are
       fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by XL
       Capital free and clear of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in
       Schedule 5.4).

              (c)    Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation
       or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
       standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, or in the
       case of XL Insurance, its jurisdiction of continuation, and is duly
       qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good
       standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by
       law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so
       organized, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in
       the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
       Each such Subsidiary has the corporate power and authority to own or hold
       under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to
       transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact except where
       the failure to have such corporate power and authority would not,
       individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
       Material Adverse Effect.

              5.5    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

              The Company has delivered to each Purchaser copies of the
financial statements of the Company and the Guarantors listed in Schedule 5.5.

Governmental Authority applicable to the Company, any Guarantor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which contravention, breach, default, Lien, conflict or

       their respective Subsidiaries in any court or before any arbitrator of

       knowledge, is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or
       regulation of any Governmental Authority, which default or violation,

              The Company, the Guarantors and their respective Subsidiaries have
filed all income tax returns that are required to have been filed in any

Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by the Company, any Guarantor or
any of their respective Subsidiaries after said date (except as sold or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and
clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement, except for those defects in title
and Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All Material leases are valid and
subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material respects.

              5.11   LICENSES, PERMITS, ETC.

              Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.11, the Company, the Guarantors
and their respective Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses, permits,

trade names, or rights thereto, that are Material, without (to the best
knowledge of the Company and the Guarantors) any conflict with the rights of
others, except for those conflicts that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

              5.12   COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.

              (a)    The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and
       administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for
       such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not
       reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
       the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant
       to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the
       Code with respect to any Plan, and no event, transaction or condition has
       occurred or exists that would reasonably be expected to result in the
       incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
       or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or
       assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to
       Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions or to
       Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or
       Liens as would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
       expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (b)    The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities
       under each of the Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than
       Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of such Plan's most
       recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
       specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial
       valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the
       assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities by an amount
       that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
       term "BENEFIT LIABILITIES" has the meaning specified in section 4001

<PAGE>
                                                                               9


       of ERISA and the terms "CURRENT VALUE" and "PRESENT VALUE" have the
       meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.

              (c)    The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred
       withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal
       liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of
       Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate could
       reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

              (d)    The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
       issuance and sale of the Notes and the issuance of the Guarantee
       hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to the
       prohibitions of section 406(a) of ERISA or in connection with which a tax
       could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The
       representation by the Company in the first sentence of this Section
       5.12(d) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of your
       representation in Section 6.2 as to the sources of the funds to be used
       to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by you.

              5.13   PRIVATE OFFERING BY THE COMPANY.

              Neither the Company nor the Guarantors nor anyone acting on their
behalf has offered the Notes or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited
any offer to buy any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in
respect thereof with, any person other than you, the Other Purchasers and not
more than 75 other institutional investors, none of whom was (i) a competitor of
the Company, any Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof, or (ii) an Affiliate of a
competitor of the Company, any Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof, each of which
has been offered the Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither the Company
or the Guarantors nor anyone acting on their behalf has taken, or will take, any
action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes or the issuance of
the Guarantee to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities
Act.

              5.14   USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS.

              The Company will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes as
set forth in Schedule 5.14. No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes
hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or
carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221, as amended), or for the
purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such
circumstances as to involve the Company or the Guarantors in a violation of
Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224, as amended) or to involve any broker or
dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220, as amended). As
used in this Section, the terms "MARGIN STOCK" and "PURPOSE OF BUYING OR
CARRYING" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.

              5.15   EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS.

              Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete

of December 31, 2000, since which date there has been no Material change in the
amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of
the Indebtedness of the Company, any Guarantor or any of their respective
Subsidiaries except such as may have occurred in the ordinary course of
business. Neither the Company nor any Guarantor nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries is in default and no waiver of default is currently in effect in
the payment of any principal or interest on any Indebtedness of the Company, any
Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount in excess of $50,000,000, and no event or condition exists with
respect to any such Indebtedness of the Company, any Guarantor or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of
time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Indebtedness to
become due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly
scheduled dates of payment.

              5.16   INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT.

              Neither the Company nor any Guarantor nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries is required to be registered as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

              6.     REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASER.

              7.3    INSPECTION.

              The Company and the Guarantors shall permit the representatives of
each holder of Notes that is an Institutional Investor:

              (a)    NO DEFAULT -- if no Default or Event of Default then
       exists, at the expense of such holder and upon reasonable prior notice to
       the Company or a Guarantor, as the case may be, to visit once per
       calendar year the principal executive offices of the Company or such
       Guarantor, to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Company,
       the Guarantors and their Subsidiaries with the executive and financial
       management of the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be; and

              (b)    DEFAULT -- if a Default or an Event of Default then exists,
       at the expense of the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, to
       visit and inspect any of the offices or properties of the Company, any
       Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to examine all their
       respective books of account, records, reports and other papers, to make
       copies and extracts therefrom, and to discuss their respective affairs,
       finances and accounts with their respective officers and independent
       public accountants (and by this provision the Company and each Guarantor
       authorizes said accountants to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts
       of the Company, each Guarantor and their Subsidiaries), all at such times
       and as often as may be reasonably requested.

              8.     PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

              8.1    OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS WITH MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT.

              The Company may, at its option, upon notice as provided below,
prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an
amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount
so prepaid, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the prepayment date with
respect to such principal amount. The Company will give each holder of Notes
written notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.1 not less than
30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment.
Each such notice shall specify such date of prepayment, the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes to be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each
Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section
8.2), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such
principal amount being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a
Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection
with such prepayment (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of
the prepayment), setting forth the details of such computation. Two Business
Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes
a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such
Make-Whole Amount as of the specified prepayment date.

              8.2    ALLOCATION OF PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS.

              In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to
Section 8.1, the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated
among all of the Notes at the time

<PAGE>
                                                                              15


outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid
principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.

              8.3    MATURITY; SURRENDER, ETC.

              In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section
8, the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due
and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on
such principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount,
if any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such
principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall
cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the
Company and canceled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in
lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

              8.4    PURCHASE OF NOTES.

              The Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to
purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of
the outstanding Notes except (a) upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes or (b) pursuant to an
offer to purchase made by the Company or an Affiliate pro rata to the holders of
all Notes at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. The
Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant
to any payment, prepayment or purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of
this Agreement and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any
such Notes.

              8.5    CHANGE OF CONTROL.

              (a)    NOTICE. The Company will, within 15 Business Days after any
       Responsible Officer has knowledge of the occurrence of any Change of
       Control, give written notice of such Change of Control to each holder of
       Notes. If a Change of Control has occurred, such notice shall contain and
       constitute an offer to prepay the Notes as described in subparagraph (b)
       of this Section 8.5 and shall be accompanied by the certificate described
       in subparagraph (e) of this Section 8.5.

              (b)    OFFER TO PREPAY THE NOTES. The offer to prepay the Notes
       contemplated by subparagraph (a) of this Section 8.5 shall be an offer to
       prepay, in accordance with and subject to this Section 8.5, all, but not
       less than all, of the Notes held by each holder on a date specified in
       such offer (the "PROPOSED PREPAYMENT DATE") that is not less than 45 days
       and not more than 75 days after the date of such offer (if the Proposed
       Prepayment Date shall not be specified in such offer, the Proposed
       Prepayment Date shall be the 60th day after the date of such offer).

              (c)    ACCEPTANCE; REJECTION. A holder of Notes may accept the
       offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.5 by causing a notice of
       such acceptance to be delivered to the Company at least 10 days prior to
       the Proposed Prepayment Date. A failure by a holder of Notes to respond
       to an offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be deemed
       to constitute a rejection of such offer by such holder.

                                                                              16


              (d)    PREPAYMENT. Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant
       to this Section 8.5 shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such
       Notes, plus the Modified Make-Whole Amount determined for the date of
       prepayment with respect to such principal amount, together with interest
       on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment. On the Business Day
       preceding the date of prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each
       holder of Notes being prepaid a statement showing the Modified Make-Whole
       Amount due in connection with such prepayment and setting forth the
       details of the computation of such amount. The prepayment shall be made
       on the Proposed Prepayment Date.

              (e)    OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE. Each offer to prepay the Notes
       pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be accompanied by a certificate,
       executed by a Senior Financial Officer of the Company and dated the date
       of such offer, specifying: (i) the Proposed Prepayment Date; (ii) that
       such offer is made pursuant to this Section 8.5; (iii) the estimated
       Modified Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such prepayment
       (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the
       prepayment), setting forth the details of such computation; (iv) the
       interest that would be due on each Note offered to be prepaid, accrued to
       the Proposed Prepayment Date; (v) that the conditions of this Section 8.5
       have been fulfilled; and (vi) in reasonable detail, the nature and date
       of the Change of Control.

              (f)    COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. The Company and the Guarantors will
       comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e)
       of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in
       connection with the prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8.5. To
       the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
       conflict with provisions of this Section 8.5, the Company and the
       Guarantors will comply with the applicable securities laws and
       regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations
       under this Section 8.5 by virtue thereof.

              8.6    MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT.

              (a)    The term "MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT" means, with respect to any
       Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of
       the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of
       such Note over the amount of such Called Principal; PROVIDED that the
       Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of
       determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following
       meanings:

              "CALLED PRINCIPAL" means, with respect to any Note, the principal
       of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.5 or has
       become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to
       Section 12.1, as the context requires.

              "DISCOUNTED VALUE" means, with respect to the Called Principal of
       any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled
       Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective
       scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
       Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a

<PAGE>
                                                                              17


       discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which
       interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with
       respect to such Called Principal.

              "REINVESTMENT YIELD" means, with respect to the Called Principal
       of any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields
       reported, as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business
       Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal,
       on the display designated as "Gov't PX" of the Bloomberg Financial Market
       Services (or, if not available, such other display as may replace such
       display on Bloomberg Financial Market Services or any other nationally
       recognized trading screen reporting on-line intra-day trading in U.S.
       Treasury securities) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having
       a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal
       as of such Settlement Date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported as of
       such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable,
       the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day
       for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day
       preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in
       Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable
       successor publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities
       having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such
       Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be
       determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations
       to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice
       and (b) interpolating linearly between (1) the actively traded U.S.
       Treasury security with the duration closest to and greater than the
       Remaining Average Life and (2) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security
       with the duration closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life.

              "REMAINING AVERAGE LIFE" means, with respect to any Called
       Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth
       year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such
       Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Called Principal.

              "REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS" means, with respect to the Called
       Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest
       thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such
       Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior
       to its scheduled due date, PROVIDED that if such Settlement Date is not a
       date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the
       Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment
       will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date
       and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.1,
       8.5 or 12.1.

              "SETTLEMENT DATE" means, with respect to the Called Principal of
       any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid
       pursuant to Section 8.1 or Section 8.5, or has become or is declared to
       be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context
       requires.

              (b)    The term "MODIFIED MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT" has the meaning set
       forth in paragraph (a) above under "Make-Whole Amount" as if all
       references to "Make-Whole

<PAGE>
                                                                              18


       Amount" therein were references to "Modified Make-Whole Amount," except
       that 1.00% shall be substituted for 0.50% in the definition of
       "Reinvestment Yield."

              9.     AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

              The Company and each Guarantor covenants that so long as any of
the Notes are outstanding:

              9.1    COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

              The Company and each Guarantor will, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, ordinances or governmental
rules or regulations to which each of them is subject, and will obtain and
maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other
governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective
properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses; PROVIDED that the
Company, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries will not be
deemed to be in violation of this Section as a result of any failure to comply
with any such Law which would not (i) result in fines, penalties, injunctive
relief or other civil or criminal liabilities which, in the aggregate, would
have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) otherwise impair the ability of the
Company or any Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the
Guarantee.

              9.2    INSURANCE.

              The Company and each Guarantor will, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, maintain with financially sound and reputable
insurers, insurance with respect to their respective Material properties in such
amounts as is customary in the case of corporations engaged in the same or
similar businesses having similar properties and similarly situated.

              9.3    MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES.

              The Company and each Guarantor will, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, maintain or cause to be maintained in good repair,
working order and condition the properties now or hereafter owned, leased or
otherwise possessed by and used or useful in their respective businesses and
will make or cause to be made all needful and proper repairs, renewals,
replacements and improvements thereto so that the business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times except if the
failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the foregoing shall not impose on the Company, any Guarantor or any of
their respective Subsidiaries any obligation in respect of any property leased
by the Company, any such Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
addition to the Company's, any Guarantor's or any of their respective
Subsidiaries' obligations under the applicable document creating such lease or
tenancy.

              9.4    PAYMENT OF TAXES.

              The Company and each Guarantor will, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, pay or discharge:

                                                                              19


              (a)    on or prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto,
       all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges or levies imposed
       upon it or any of their respective properties or income;

              (b)    on or prior to the date when due, all lawful claims of
       materialmen, mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other like
       Persons which, if unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien upon any
       such property; and

              (c)    on or prior to the date when due, all other lawful claims
       which, if unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien upon any such
       property (other than Liens not forbidden by Section 10.2) or which, if
       unpaid, might give rise to a claim entitled to priority over general
       creditors of the Company or any Guarantor in any proceeding under the
       Bermuda Companies Act 1981 or the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978, or any
       insolvency proceeding, liquidation, receivership, rehabilitation,
       dissolution or winding-up involving the Company, any Guarantor or any of
       their respective Subsidiaries;

PROVIDED that, unless and until foreclosure, distraint, levy, sale or similar
proceedings shall have been commenced, neither the Company nor any Guarantor
need pay or discharge any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim so long as
the validity thereof is contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings
diligently conducted and so long as such reserves or other appropriate
provisions as may be required by GAAP or SAP, as the case may be, shall have
been made therefor and so long as such failure to pay or discharge does not have
a Material Adverse Effect.

                                                                              20


              9.5    CORPORATE EXISTENCE, ETC. The Company and each Guarantor
will, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, maintain its
corporate existence and its material rights and franchises in full force and
effect in its jurisdiction of incorporation, or in the case of XL Insurance, its
jurisdiction of continuation, except where the failure to maintain such
corporate existence and material rights and franchises would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or other transaction permitted under Section 10.3 or 10.5 or any
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, asset transfer or similar transaction
solely between or among the Company, the Guarantors and their respective
Subsidiaries otherwise permitted under Section 10.3. The Company and each
Guarantor will, and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, qualify
and remain qualified as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
failure to receive or retain such qualification would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

              9.6    BOOKS AND RECORDS. The Company and each Guarantor will, and
will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, make and keep books,
records and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
their transactions and the dispositions of their assets, and will, and will
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements required by this Agreement in conformity with GAAP and SAP, as
applicable, and to ascertain accountability for assets.

              9.7    CONTINUATION OF BUSINESS. The Company and each of the
Guarantors and each of their respective Subsidiaries will continue to engage in
substantially the same business or businesses it engaged in (or proposes to
engage in) on the date hereof and businesses related or incidental thereto.

Guarantor shall, nor shall the Company or any Guarantor permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, at any time create, incur, assume or suffer to exist

              12.    REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.

              12.1   ACCELERATION.

              (a)    If an Event of Default with respect to the Company
       described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of
       Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described in clause
       (vi) of paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses
       clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has occurred, all of the Notes then
       outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

              (b)    If any other Event of Default has occurred and is
       continuing, any holder or holders of a majority in principal amount of
       the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their option,
       by notice or notices to the Company, declare all of the Notes then
       outstanding to be immediately due and payable.

              (c)    If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b)
       of Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of
       Notes at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at
       any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company,
       declare all the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and
       payable.

              Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1,
whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and
the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of
such principal amount (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law), shall
all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company
(except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment
of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in

<PAGE>
                                                                              27


the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event
of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such
right under such circumstances.

              12.2   OTHER REMEDIES.

              If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared
immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the
time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by
an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for
the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or
for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or
in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or
otherwise.

              12.3   RESCISSION.

              At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable
pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to
the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if
(a) the Company and/or one or more of the Guarantors have paid all overdue
interest on the Notes, all principal of and Make-Whole Amount or Modified
Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid
other than by reason of such declaration and all interest on such overdue
principal and Make-Whole Amount or Modified Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the
Notes at the Default Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than
non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such
declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c)
no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due
pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section
12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

              12.4   NO WAIVERS OR ELECTION OF REMEDIES.

              No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any
Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof
or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power
or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof
shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or
therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or
otherwise.

treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company
shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary and shall have
no liability to any unregistered holder. The Company shall give to any holder of
a Note that certifies to the Company that it is an Institutional Investor
promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and
addresses of all registered holders of Notes.

              13.2   TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES.

Note or his attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address
for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall
execute and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as provided below), one or

transferred in denominations of less than $500,000; PROVIDED that if necessary
to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of
Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $500,000. Any transferee,
by its acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee),
shall be deemed to have made the representations set forth in Sections 6.1 and
6.2.

destruction or mutilation), and

              (a)    in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity
       reasonably satisfactory to the Company (PROVIDED that if the holder of
       such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another
       holder of a Note with a minimum net worth of at least $100,000,000, such
       Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be
       satisfactory), or

              (b)    in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
       thereof,

the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new

paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid
thereon.

holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place
of payment shall be either the principal office of the Company in such
jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company in such
jurisdiction.

              14.2   HOME OFFICE PAYMENT.

              So long as you or your nominee shall be the holder of any Note,
and not withstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the
contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal,
Make-Whole Amount or Modified Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the
method and at the address specified for such purpose below your name in Schedule
A, or by such other method or at such other address as you shall have from time
to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the
presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon,
except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or
reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall
surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such
request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the place of
payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior
to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by you or your nominee you
will, at your election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid
thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender
such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section
13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any
Institutional Investor that becomes a holder of any Note purchased by you under
this Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as you
have made in this Section 14.2.

local or other counsel) incurred by you and each Other Purchaser or holder of a
Note in connection with such transactions and in connection with any amendments,
waivers or consents under or in respect of this Agreement, the Notes or any

than those retained by you).

              15.2   SURVIVAL.

              The obligations of the Company under this Section 15 will survive
the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any

              16.    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE
                     AGREEMENT.

              All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantee, the
purchase or transfer by you of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein
and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of
a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of you
or any other holder of a Note. All statements contained in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor pursuant to this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the Company or such
Guarantor under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantee embody the entire agreement and
understanding between you and the Company and the Guarantors and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

              17.1   REQUIREMENTS.

              This Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantee may be amended, and
the observance of any term hereof or thereof may be waived (either retroactively
or prospectively),

<PAGE>
                                                                              31


with (and only with) the written consent of the Company, the Guarantors and the
Required Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the
provisions of Section l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof or of any provision of the
Guarantee, or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to
you unless consented to by you in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver
may, without the written consent of the holder of each Note at the time
outstanding affected thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12
relating to acceleration or rescission, change the amount or time of any
prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate or change the time of
payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount or the
Modified Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage of the
principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to
any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b),
12, 17 or 20.

              17.2   SOLICITATION OF HOLDERS OF NOTES.

              (a)    SOLICITATION. The Company will provide each holder of the
       Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with
       reasonably sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the
       date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed
       and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or
       consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof or of the Notes or the
       Guarantee. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies
       of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions
       of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following
       the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the
       consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.

              (b)    PAYMENT. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or
       cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or
       additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any
       holder of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering
       into by any holder of Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the
       terms and provisions hereof or of the Notes or the Guarantee unless such
       remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted,
       on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding even
       if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.

              17.3   BINDING EFFECT, ETC.

              Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section
17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon
each future holder of any Note and upon the Company or the Guarantors, as the
case may be, without regard to whether such Note or the Guarantee has been
marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will
extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of
Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon.
No course of dealing between the Company or any Guarantor and the holder of any
Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall
operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein,
the term "THIS AGREEMENT" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it
may from time to time be amended or supplemented.

                                                                              32


              17.4   NOTES HELD BY COMPANY, ETC.

              Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the
requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding
approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this
Agreement, the Notes or the Guarantee, or have directed the taking of any action
provided herein or therein to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a
specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

<PAGE>
                                                                              33


made by you in the regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or
further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in
evidence. This Section 19 shall not prohibit the Company, any Guarantor or any
other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent
that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate
the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

              20.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

              You agree to keep confidential any information relating to the
Company, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries received by you
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement which is (a) information which
you reasonably expect that the Company, such Guarantor or such Subsidiary would
want to keep confidential or (b) information which is clearly marked
"CONFIDENTIAL"; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this Section 20 shall not be construed
to prevent you from disclosing such information (i) to any Affiliate that shall
agree in writing for the benefit of the Company or the applicable Guarantor or
Subsidiary, as the case may be, to be bound by this obligation of
confidentiality, (ii) upon the order of any court or demand of any regulatory
agency or authority having jurisdiction over you which request or demand has the
force of law, (iii) that has been publicly disclosed, other than from or as a
result of a breach of this provision by you, (iv) that has been obtained from
any person that is neither a party to this Agreement nor an Affiliate of any
such party, but only to the extent that such disclosure does not, to your
knowledge, violate a confidentiality agreement or other duty of confidentiality
between such person and the Company or the applicable Guarantor or Subsidiary,
(v) in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under
any Guarantee or Note, (vi) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any
Guarantee, (vii) to any prospective purchaser of your Notes who shall agree in
writing for the benefit of the Company and the Guarantors and their respective
Subsidiaries to be bound by the obligation of confidentiality in this Agreement
or in respect of which the transfer to such prospective purchaser has been
consented to by the Company or the applicable Guarantor, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld if such purchaser is not (x) a competitor of the
Company, any Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof or (y) an Affiliate of a
competitor of the Company, any Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof, (viii) your
directors, offices, employees, agents and attorneys (to the extent such
disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment

organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to
information about your investment portfolio, or (xii) any other Person to which
such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate to effect compliance
with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to you. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, you agree that neither you nor any of your Affiliates will trade the
securities of the Company or any of the Guarantors based upon material
non-public information that you receive pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement.

              21.    SUBSTITUTION.

              21.1   SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

              You shall have the right to substitute any one of your Affiliates
as the purchaser of the Notes that you have agreed to purchase hereunder so long
as such Affiliate is not (i) a competitor of the Company, any Guarantor or any
Affiliate thereof or (ii) an Affiliate of a competitor of the Company, any
Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof, by written notice to the Company, which
notice shall be signed by both you and such Affiliate, shall contain such
Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement (including, specifically,
Section 20) and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy
with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt
of such notice, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in
this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu
of you. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser
hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to you all of the Notes then
held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer
(and confirmation by you of your agreement to be bound by this agreement
(including, specifically, Section 20) and the accuracy with respect to you of
the representations set forth in Section 6), wherever the word "you" is used in
this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall no longer be
deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to you, and you shall have
all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.

              21.2   SUBSTITUTION OF ISSUER.

              Subject to the provisions of this Section 21.2, the Company shall
have the right at any time, without the consent of any holder of Notes, to agree
to and cause the substitution of any other Subsidiary of XL Capital in its place
as debtor and obligor with respect to the Notes (each, a "SUBSTITUTE"), and upon
such substitution the Company shall be released from all liability that it may
have under the Notes and this Note Purchase Agreement. Any such substitution
shall be made by an addendum to this Note Purchase Agreement and each of the
Other Agreements, duly executed by the Substitute, pursuant to which (i) the
Substitute shall agree to assume all of the obligations of the Company hereunder
and under the Other Agreements and the Notes, and (ii) each of the Guarantors
shall confirm that their respective Guarantees remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding such substitution. Such Substitute shall be a solvent
corporation and either (x) such Substitute shall be organized and existing under
the laws of the United States or any State thereof (including the District of
Columbia), or (ii) such addendum shall contain provisions applicable to such
Substitute with the substantive effect of Sections 7 (Taxes; Payment of
Additional Amounts), 9 (Submission to Jurisdiction), 10 (Waiver of Venue), 11
(Service of Process), and 13 (Judgment Currency) of the Guarantee. In any case,
(A) the Company and the Substitute shall have caused either (i) appropriately
qualified in-house counsel at the Company or any of the Guarantors or the
Substitute, or (ii) special counsel to the Substitute in connection with such
substitution or (iii) other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a
majority of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to have rendered
a favorable opinion reasonably satisfactory to such holders with respect to the
power and authority of such Substitute to enter into and perform such addendum
and with respect to the execution and delivery of, and valid, legal and binding
nature of such addendum and its enforceability in accordance with its terms; and
(B) immediately after giving

<PAGE>
                                                                              35


effect to such substitution, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing. The Company and the Substitute shall deliver to each holder
of Notes a copy of such addendum and opinion not less than five Business Days
prior to the date on which the substitution is proposed to become effective.

              22.    MISCELLANEOUS.

              22.1   SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

              All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by
or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent
holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.

              22.2   PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS.

              Anything in this Agreement, the Notes or any Guarantee to the
contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal of, or Make-Whole Amount or
Modified Make-Whole Amount or interest on, any Note that is due on a date other
than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without
including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable
on such next succeeding Business Day.

              22.3   SEVERABILITY.

              Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall (to the fullest extent permitted by law) not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

              22.4   CONSTRUCTION.

              Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express
provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained
herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an
express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other
covenant.

              22.5   COUNTERPARTS.

              This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each
signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.

              22.6   GOVERNING LAW.

              THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND THE DUTIES OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

              22.7   ACCOUNTING TERMS; GAAP AND SAP.

              Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an
accounting or financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP or
SAP, as the context requires, each as in effect from time to time; PROVIDED
that, if the Company notifies the holders of the Notes that the Company or any
Guarantor requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect
of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or SAP, as the case may
be, or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision, regardless
of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or SAP,
as the case may be, or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be
interpreted on the basis of GAAP or SAP, as the case may be, as in effect and
applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such
notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance
herewith.
