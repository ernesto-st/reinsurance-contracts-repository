receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.04.  Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans
to the Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in
an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in
(i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding
$30,000,000 or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the total
Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required
to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the
foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

          (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not
later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline
Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date
(which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The
Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such
notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each
Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general
deposit account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a
Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

          (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any

<PAGE>

                                                                              44

upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof
to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above,
to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender,
such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each
Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving
Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with
respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so
received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify
the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to
this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall
be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts
received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of
the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline
Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly
remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to
the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The
purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall
not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

          (d) Replacement of Swingline Lender. A Swingline Lender may be
replaced by any other Lender at any time that there are no outstanding Swingline
Loans by a written agreement among the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and
successor Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of
any such replacement of the Swingline Lender. From and after the effective date
of any such replacement, (i) the successor Swingline Lender shall have all the
rights and obligations of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement and (ii)
references herein to the term

<PAGE>

                                                                              45

"Swingline Lender" shall be deemed to refer to such successor Swingline Lender.
After the replacement of the Swingline Lender pursuant to this clause (d), the
replaced Swingline Lender shall not be required to make any Swingline Loans.
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in Section 9.04, at no time
following the replacement of the Swingline Lender pursuant to this clause (d),
may the Swingline Lender as of such time make an assignment or assignments the
effect of which would be to reduce its Revolving Commitment to zero.

          SECTION 2.05.  Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of
Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the

inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms
and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement
submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing
Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

          (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,

arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to
the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance
of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of
Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on
which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c)
of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If there is more than one
Issuing Bank, the Borrower may select among the Issuing Banks in connection with
the issuance of any Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the
Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's
standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of
Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,

<PAGE>

                                                                              46

amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $35,000,000
and (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving
Commitments.

          (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of
the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

          (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank
and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e)
of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the
Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of
Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

          (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement

Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior

<PAGE>

                                                                              47

to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice
is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of the receipt,
or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the
day of receipt; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than
$100,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth
herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be
financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent
amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such
payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving
Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when
due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect
thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following
receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in
the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such
Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that
Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the
Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may
appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of
ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

          (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision herein or therein, (ii) any

                                                                              48

a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment
by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or
(iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute
a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders
nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability
or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of
any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder
(irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission
or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any
Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall
not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to
the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties
hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful
misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care
in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting
the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the
terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion,
either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are
not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify

<PAGE>

                                                                              49

the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

          (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the
Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.

          (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced
at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the successor to such Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify
the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such
replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees
accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the
successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

          (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, on the Business Day

<PAGE>

                                                                              50

that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving
Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure)
demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the
Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name
of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in
cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and
unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash
collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become
immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon
the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in
clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Each such deposit shall be held by the
Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall
have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of
withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment
of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense,
such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC
Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to
satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower
is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after
all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

          (k) Each of the Existing Issuing Bank and the Existing DAP Issuing
Bank shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the Effective
Date, a schedule identifying all Existing Letters of Credit issued by it. Each
of the Existing Issuing Bank and the Existing DAP Issuing Bank also shall notify
the Administrative Agent of any LC Disbursement or any expiration, termination
or renewal of any Existing Letters of Credit issued by it.

                                                                              51

          SECTION 2.06.  Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided
in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.07.  Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and
Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an
initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the
Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue
such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest
Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect
different options with respect to

<PAGE>

                                                                              52

different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which
may not be converted or continued.

          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and paragraph
(f) of this Section:

          (i)   the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
    and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
    portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
    Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses
    (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

          (ii)  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
    Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
    Eurodollar Borrowing; and

          (iv)  if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
    Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
    election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term
    "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

<PAGE>

                                                                              53

          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an
Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to
or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto.

          (f) A Borrowing of any Class may not be converted to or continued as a
Eurodollar Borrowing if after giving effect thereto (i) the Interest Period
therefor would commence before and end after a date on which any principal of
the Loans of such Class is scheduled to be repaid and (ii) the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Eurodollar Borrowings of such Class
with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such scheduled repayment date plus
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class would
be less than the aggregate principal amount of Loans of such Class required to
be repaid on such scheduled repayment date.

          SECTION 2.08.  Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, (i) the Tranche A-1 Commitments and Tranche C-1
Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Redemption
Date and (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving
Maturity Date.

          (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any
concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11,
the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

<PAGE>

                                                                              54

          (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state
that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments
shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Revolving Commitments.

          (d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Tranche A Commitments,
Tranche B Commitments, and Tranche C Commitments have terminated.

          SECTION 2.09.  Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan
of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term
Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline
Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of
the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made
that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business
Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a
Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then
outstanding.

          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof
and the

<PAGE>

                                                                              55

Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

          SECTION 2.10.  Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject to adjustment
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower shall repay Tranche A
Term Borrowings on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal amount

          (e) To the extent not previously paid, (i) all Tranche A Term Loans
and Tranche A-1 Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche A Maturity
Date and (ii) all Tranche C Term Loans and Tranche C-1 Term Loans shall be due
and payable on the Tranche C Maturity Date.

          (f) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing of any Class shall be applied
to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Borrowings of such
Class to be made pursuant to this Section ratably; provided that any prepayment
made pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall be applied, first, to reduce the next
scheduled repayments of the Term Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to
this Section in chronological order, to the extent such repayments are scheduled
to be due within 12 months after such prepayment is made, until such next
scheduled repayments have been eliminated as a result of reductions hereunder
and, second, to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term
Borrowings of such Class to be made pursuant to this Section ratably. The
parties hereto acknowledge that the amortization amounts set forth in paragraph
(a) and (c) above reflect all adjustments for prepayments of Tranche A Term
Loans and Tranche C Term Loans made prior to the Restatement Effective Date.

          (g) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings of any Class
hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of the
applicable Class to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such
repayment; provided that each repayment of Term Borrowings of any Class shall be
applied to repay any outstanding ABR Term Borrowings of such Class before any
other Borrowings of such Class. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied
ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term
Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.

          SECTION 2.11.  Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, subject to the requirements of this Section.

          (b) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Cash Proceeds are
received by or on behalf of Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect
of any Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, immediately after such Net Cash
Proceeds are received, prepay Term Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to
such Net Cash Proceeds; provided

<PAGE>

                                                                              58

that, in the case of a Prepayment Event described in clause (c) of the
definition of the term "Prepayment Event", if such Prepayment Event is an IPO
and if the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the
date of such IPO, a certificate of a Financial Officer certifying that (i) no
Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Borrower or Holdings intends
to apply a portion of the Net Cash Proceeds from such IPO (which portion shall
be specified in such certificate and shall not exceed 25% of such Net Cash
Proceeds), within 365 days after the date of such IPO, for the purposes
specified in clause (viii) of Section 6.07(b), then the amount of the prepayment
required by this paragraph in respect of such event shall be reduced by the
portion of the Net Cash Proceeds therefrom specified in such certificate;
provided further that, upon the expiration of such 365-day period, if the
Borrower and Holdings have not applied the entire amount of such portion of such
Net Cash Proceeds for the purposes specified in clause (viii) of Section
6.07(b), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof and a
prepayment shall be required under this paragraph to the extent such portion has
not been so applied during such period.

          (c) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, commencing
with the fiscal year ending December 28, 2002, the Borrower shall prepay Term
Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such
fiscal year; provided that the amount of the prepayment required by this
paragraph shall be equal to 25% (instead of 50%) of Excess Cash Flow for such
fiscal year if, at the end of such fiscal year, the Senior Leverage Ratio is
less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00. Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph
shall be made on the last day of the first fiscal quarter of the fiscal year
following the fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being calculated.

          (d) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings
hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid
and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section; provided that each prepayment of Borrowings of
any Class shall be applied to prepay ABR Borrowings of such Class before any
other Borrowings of such Class. In the event of any optional or mandatory
prepayment of Term Borrowings made at a time when Term Borrowings of more than
one Class remain outstanding, the Borrower shall select Term Borrowings to be
prepaid so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated among the
Tranche A Term Borrowings, Tranche A-1 Term Borrowings, Tranche C Term
Borrowings and Tranche C-1 Term Borrowings pro rata based on the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Borrowings of

<PAGE>

                                                                              59

each such Class; provided that, so long as there are any Tranche A Term
Borrowings or Tranche A-1 Term Borrowings outstanding, any Tranche C Lender or
Tranche C-1 Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) at least one Business Day prior to the prepayment date,
to decline all or any portion of any prepayment of its Tranche C Term Loans or
Tranche C-1 Term Loans pursuant to this Section (other than an optional
prepayment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, which may not be
declined), in which case the aggregate amount of the prepayment that would have
been applied to prepay Tranche C Term Loans or Tranche C-1 Term Loans but was so
declined shall be applied to prepay Tranche A Term Borrowings and Tranche A-1
Term Borrowings on a pro rata basis. The rights of the Tranche C Lenders and the
Tranche C-1 Lenders under this Section 2.11(d) shall not be changed without the
written consent of the Tranche C Lenders or the Tranche C-1 Lenders, as
applicable, holding a majority of the outstanding Tranche C Term Loans or
Tranche C-1 Term Loans, as applicable.

          (e) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a
notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08,
then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is
revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such
notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be
permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided
in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a
mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to
the Loans

<PAGE>

                                                                              60

included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

          SECTION 2.12.  Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent (i) for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment
fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused
amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and (ii) for the account of each Tranche A-1 Term Lender
and Tranche C-1 Term Lender a commitment fee which shall accrue at the rate of
0.50% per annum on the amount of the Tranche A-1 Commitment and Tranche C-1
Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Restatement
Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitments terminate.
Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March,
June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
Effective Date; provided that accrued commitment fees for the Tranche A-1
Commitments and Tranche C-1 Commitments shall be payable on the date on which
such Commitments terminate. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
commitment fees, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used
to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender
(and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such
purpose).

          (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as interest on Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's
Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have
any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue
at the rate of 1/4 of 1% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC
Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of

<PAGE>

                                                                              61

termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to
be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to
the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued
through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of
each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day,
commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
RevolvingCommitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within
10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed
on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

          (c)  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

          (d)  All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.13.  Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
(including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate.

          (b)  The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

          (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the

<PAGE>

                                                                              62

preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of
this Section.

          (d)  Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon
termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of
an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period),
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on
the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

          (e)  All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.14.  Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a)  the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
     exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

          (b)  the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
     the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and
     fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their
     Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

<PAGE>

                                                                              63

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.15.  Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

          (i)  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

          (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank
     market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans
     made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b)  If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in
Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital
of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence
of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit
held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a
level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's holding company could have

<PAGE>

                                                                              64

achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or
the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time
the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such
reduction suffered.

          (c)  A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section, and, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor, shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown
as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

          (d)  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing
Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.16.  Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be
revoked under Section 2.11(e) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d)
the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request

<PAGE>

                                                                              65

by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower
shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such
event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any
Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the
excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO
Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date
of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or,
in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that
would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of
interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the
interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of
such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other
banks in the Eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section, and, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor, shall be delivered to
the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.17.  Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable law.

          (b)  In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c)  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the

<PAGE>

                                                                              66

Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability, and
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor, delivered to the
Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its
own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

          (d)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e)  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the Code, the law of the jurisdiction in
which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Any
Foreign Lender which is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Code and intends to claim exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax
under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of
"portfolio interest" shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy for the
Administrative Agent) a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or
successors thereto (and, if such Foreign Lender delivers a Form W-8BEN, a
certificate representing that such Foreign Lender is not a bank for purposes of
Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a ten-percent shareholder (within the meaning
of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled
foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section
864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign

                                                                              67

claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding
tax on payments of interest by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

          (f)  If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to
which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay
over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with
respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in this Section 2.17(f)
shall require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

          SECTION 2.18.  Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to
the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any
such payments

                                                                              68

received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall
be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment
accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such
extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC
Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest
and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal
and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.

          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to

<PAGE>

                                                                              69

the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions
of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and
agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may
exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          (d)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation.

          (e)  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

          SECTION 2.19.  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to Section 2.15

<PAGE>

                                                                              70

or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) in the reasonable judgment
of such Lender, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

          (b)  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline
Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender
shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such
assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

          Each of Holdings and the Borrower represents and warrants to the
Lenders on the Restatement Effective Date and on each date thereafter as
required under any Loan Document that:

          SECTION 3.01.  Organization; Powers. Each of Holdings, the Borrower
and their Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

          SECTION 3.02.  Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required,
stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
of Holdings and the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to
which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan
Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Holdings, the
Borrower or such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law.

          SECTION 3.03.  Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions
(a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or
any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) such as have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect and except filings necessary
to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents or (ii) where the failure to
obtain such consent or approval or make such registration or filing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation
or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of Holdings, the
Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental
Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a

<PAGE>

                                                                              72

default under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon
Holdings, the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries or their assets, or give
rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by Holdings, the
Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries (other than repayment of the Existing DAP
Indebtedness), and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of Holdings, the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries, except
Liens created under the Loan Documents.

          SECTION 3.04.  Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a)
Each of Holdings and the Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its
consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity and
cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2001, reported
on by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, (ii) as of and for
the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended October 5, 2002,
certified by one of its Financial Officers and (iii) as of the end of and for
each fiscal month ended after the end of the fiscal quarter ended October 5,
2002 and prior to the date 30 days prior to the Restatement Effective Date,
certified by one of its Financial Officers. Such financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of
operations and cash flows of Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to customary
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the
statements referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) above.

          (b) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred to above
or the notes thereto or in the Slide Presentation and except for the Disclosed
Matters, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of Holdings, the Borrower
or their Subsidiaries has, as of the Restatement Effective Date, any material
contingent liabilities.

          (c) Since October 5, 2002, there has been no material adverse change
in the business, assets, operations, prospects or condition, financial or
otherwise, of Holdings, the Borrower and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          SECTION 3.05.  Properties. (a) Each of Holdings, the Borrower and
their Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its
real and personal property material to its business (including its Mortgaged
Properties), except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with its
ability to conduct its business as

<PAGE>

                                                                              73

currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.

          (b) Each of Holdings, the Borrower and their Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by Holdings,
the Borrower and their Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any
other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

          (c) The Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent a schedule
setting forth the address of each real property that is owned or leased by
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date after giving effect
to the Transactions.

          (d) As of the Restatement Effective Date, neither Holdings, the
Borrower nor any of their Subsidiaries has received notice of, or has knowledge
of, any pending or contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any Mortgaged
Property or any sale or disposition thereof in lieu of condemnation. Neither any
Mortgaged Property nor any interest therein is subject to any right of first
refusal, option or other contractual right to purchase such Mortgaged Property
or interest therein (other than options to purchase any such Mortgaged Property
leased by the Borrower as lessee).

          SECTION 3.06.  Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower,
threatened against or affecting Holdings, the Borrower or any of their
Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other
than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or
the Transactions.

          (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither Holdings, the Borrower
nor any of their Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental
Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval
required under any

<PAGE>

                                                                              74

Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii)
has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or
(iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

          (c) Since the Effective Date, there has been no change in the status
of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted
in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.07.  Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of Holdings,
the Borrower and their Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations
and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and
all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its
property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No
Default has occurred and is continuing.

          SECTION 3.08.  Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither
Holdings, the Borrower nor any of their Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment
company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company
Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation
under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

          SECTION 3.09.  Taxes. Each of Holdings, the Borrower and their
Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports
required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required
to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and for which Holdings, the Borrower or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b)
to the extent that the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.10.  ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $1,000,000 the fair market

<PAGE>

                                                                              75

value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the assumptions used for
purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of
the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed
by more than $1,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of all such
underfunded Plans.

          SECTION 3.11.  Disclosure. Holdings and the Borrower have disclosed to
the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to
which Holdings, the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries is subject, and all
other matters known to any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Slide Presentation nor any of the other reports, financial statements,
certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder
(as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial
information, Holdings and the Borrower represent only that such information was
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the
time.

          SECTION 3.12.  Subsidiaries. After giving effect to the consummation
of the Reorganization on the Effective Date, Holdings does not have any
Subsidiaries other than the Borrower and the Borrower's Subsidiaries. Schedule
3.12 sets forth the name of, and the ownership interest of the Borrower in, each
Subsidiary of the Borrower and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary
Loan Party, in each case as of the Restatement Effective Date.

          SECTION 3.13.  Insurance. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a description of
all insurance maintained by or on behalf of Holdings, the Borrower and their
Subsidiaries as of the Restatement Effective Date. As of the Restatement
Effective Date, all premiums in respect of such insurance have been paid.

          SECTION 3.14.  Labor Matters. As of the Restatement Effective Date,
there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against Holdings, the Borrower or
any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower,
threatened. Holdings, the Borrower and the

<PAGE>

                                                                              76

Subsidiaries have not been in material violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act
or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with the
hours worked by or payments made to employees or any similar matters. All
payments due from Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any
claim may be made against Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account
of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of Holdings, the Borrower or such
Subsidiary, except where the failure to pay such liability individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of
termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any
collective bargaining agreement to which Holdings, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is bound.

          SECTION 3.15.  Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the
Restatement Transactions to occur on the Restatement Effective Date and the
Redemption Date and immediately following the making of each Loan made on the
Restatement Effective Date and after giving effect to the application of the
proceeds of such Loans, (a) the fair value of the assets of each Loan Party, at
a fair valuation, will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of
each Loan Party will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liability of its debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent
or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured;
(c) each Loan Party will be able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
matured; and (d) each Loan Party will not have unreasonably small capital with
which to conduct the business in which it is engaged as such business is now
conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Restatement Effective
Date.

          SECTION 3.16.  Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations constitute "Senior
Debt" and "Designated Senior Debt" under and as defined in the Existing
Subordinated Debt Documents and the Additional Subordinated Debt Documents.

          SECTION 3.17.  Security Documents. (a) The Pledge Agreement is
effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of
the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the
Collateral (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) and, when such Collateral is
delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Pledge Agreement shall constitute a fully
perfected

<PAGE>

                                                                              77

first priority Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest
of each pledgor thereunder in such Collateral, in each case prior and superior
in right to any other Person.

          (b) The Security Agreement is effective to create in favor of the
Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid
and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Security
Agreement) and, when financing statements in appropriate form are filed in the
offices specified on Schedule 6 to the Perfection Certificate, the Security
Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such Collateral
other than the Intellectual Property (as defined in the Security Agreement), to
the extent that a security interest can be perfected in such Collateral by
filing, recording or registering a financing statement or analogous document in
the United States (or any political subdivision thereof) and its territories and
possessions pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law in
such jurisdiction, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person,
other than with respect to Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02.

          (c) When the Security Agreement is filed in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, the Security
Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in the Intellectual Property
(as defined in the Security Agreement) in which a security interest may be
perfected by filing, recording or registering a security agreement, financing
statement or analogous document in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
or the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, in each case prior and
superior in right to any other Person other than Liens expressly permitted by
Section 6.02 (it being understood that subsequent recordings in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office may be
necessary to perfect a Lien on registered trademarks, trademark applications and
copyrights acquired by the Loan Parties after the Effective Date).

          (d) The Mortgages are effective to create, subject to the exceptions
listed in each title insurance policy covering such Mortgage (or, in the case of
the Mortgages with respect to each Mortgaged Property set forth on Schedule
1.01(b) and identified with an asterisk, subject to Permitted Encumbrances), in
favor of the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a

                                                                              78

legal, valid and enforceable Lien on all of the Loan Parties' right, title and
interest in and to the Mortgaged Properties thereunder and the proceeds thereof,
and when the Mortgages are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 3.17, the
Mortgages shall constitute a Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title
and interest of the Loan Parties in such Mortgaged Properties and the proceeds
thereof, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other
than with respect to the rights of Persons pursuant to Liens expressly permitted
by Section 6.02.

    expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.

Each notice delivered under this Section shall be accompanied by a statement of

recent certificate delivered pursuant to this Section and (ii) certifying that
all Uniform Commercial Code financing statements (including fixture filings, as
applicable) or other appropriate filings, recordings or registrations, including
all refilings, rerecordings and reregistrations, containing a description of the
Collateral have been filed of record in each governmental, municipal or other

business; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger,
consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.03.

          SECTION 5.05.  Payment of Obligations. Each of Holdings and the
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay its Indebtedness
and other obligations, including Tax liabilities, that, if not paid, would

shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a) the validity or amount
thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b)
Holdings, the Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate
reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP, (c) such contest
effectively suspends collection of the contested obligation and the enforcement
of any Lien securing such obligation and (d) the failure to make payment pending
such contest would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

          SECTION 5.06.  Maintenance of Properties. Each of Holdings and the

and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and
reputable insurance companies (i) adequate insurance for its insurable
properties, all to such extent and against such risks, including fire, casualty
and other risks insured against by extended coverage, as is customary with
companies in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar
locations, (ii) such other insurance as is required pursuant to the terms of any
Security Document and (iii) business interruption insurance, insuring against
loss of gross earnings for a period of not less than 12 months arising from any

Collateral shall be endorsed or otherwise amended to include (i) a
non-contributing mortgage clause (regarding improvements to real property) and
lenders' loss payable clause (regarding personal property), in each case in
favor of the Administrative Agent and providing for losses thereunder to be
payable to the Administrative Agent or its designee, (ii) a provision to the
effect that neither the Borrower, the Administrative Agent nor any other party
shall be a coinsurer and (iii) such other provisions as the Administrative Agent
may reasonably require from time to time to protect the interests of the
Lenders. Commercial general liability policies shall be endorsed to name the
Administrative Agent as an additional insured. Business interruption policies
shall name the Administrative Agent as loss payee. Each such policy referred to
in this paragraph also shall provide that it shall not be canceled, modified or
not renewed (i) by reason of nonpayment of premium except upon not less than 10
days' prior written notice thereof by the insurer to the Administrative Agent
(giving the Administrative Agent the right to cure defaults in the payment of
premiums) or (ii) for any other reason except upon not less than 30 days' prior
written notice thereof by the insurer to the Administrative Agent. Holdings or
the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to the
cancelation, modification or nonrenewal of any such policy of insurance, a copy
of a renewal or replacement policy (or other evidence of renewal of a policy
previously delivered to the Administrative Agent) together with evidence

of any casualty or other insured damage to any material portion of any
Collateral or the commencement of any action or proceeding for the taking of any
Collateral or any part thereof or interest therein under power of eminent domain
or by condemnation or similar proceeding.

          (b) If any event described in paragraph (a) of this Section results in
Net Cash Proceeds (whether in the form of insurance proceeds, condemnation award
or otherwise), the Administrative Agent is authorized to collect such Net Cash
Proceeds and, if received by Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary, such Net
Cash Proceeds shall be paid over the Administrative Agent; provided that (i) if
the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds in respect of such event (other than proceeds of
business income insurance) are less than $5,000,000, such Net Cash Proceeds
shall be paid over to Holdings or the Borrower unless a Default has occurred and
is continuing, and (ii) all proceeds of business income insurance shall be paid
over to the Borrower unless a Default has occurred and is continuing. All such
Net Cash Proceeds retained by or paid over to the Administrative Agent shall be
held by the Administrative Agent and released from time to time to pay the costs
of repairing, restoring or replacing the affected property in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Security Document, subject to the provisions of the
applicable Security Document regarding application of such Net Cash Proceeds
during a Default.

          (c) If any Net Cash Proceeds retained by or paid over to the
Administrative Agent as provided above continue to be held by the Administrative
Agent on the date that is 360 days (or, in the case of a distribution center,
two years, provided that repair, restoration or replacement commenced within 270
days after the occurrence of such event) after the occurrence of the event
resulting in such Net Cash Proceeds, then such Net Cash Proceeds shall be
applied to prepay Term Borrowings as provided in Section 2.11(b).

          SECTION 5.09.  Books and Records; Inspection and Audit Rights. (a)
Each of Holdings and the Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, keep proper books of record and account in which full, true and correct
entries are made of all dealings and transactions in relation to its business
and activities. Each of Holdings and the Borrower will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, upon reasonable prior notice, to visit and inspect its

as reasonably requested; provided that the Borrower shall be given the
opportunity to be present at any discussion with its independent accountants.

          (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by the Administrative
Agent (including any consultants, accountants, lawyers and appraisers retained
by the Administrative Agent) to conduct evaluations and appraisals of (i) the
inventory of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the systems providing
for the monitoring and reporting of such inventory, all at such reasonable times
and as often as reasonably requested. The Borrower shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of any representatives retained by the Administrative Agent to
conduct any such evaluation or appraisal (including the fees and expenses
associated with the services performed by the Administrative Agent's collateral
monitoring department); provided that the Borrower shall not be required to pay
such fees and expenses for more than one such evaluation or appraisal during any
calendar year unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

          SECTION 5.10.  Compliance with Laws. Each of Holdings and the Borrower
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 5.11.  Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit. The proceeds of
the Tranche A-1 Term Loans and Tranche C-1 Term Loans will be used only to
finance the Redemption. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans (other than the
proceeds from the Initial Revolving Borrowing) and Swingline Loans will be used
only for general corporate purposes. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be
used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation
of any of the Regulations of the Board, including Regulations U and X. Letters
of Credit will be issued only for general corporate purposes.

          SECTION 5.12.  Additional Subsidiaries. If any additional Subsidiary
is formed or acquired after the Effective Date, Holdings and the Borrower will
notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof and (a) if such
Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Loan Party, Holdings and the Borrower will cause such
Subsidiary to become a party to the Guarantee Agreement, the Indemnity
Subrogation and

Contribution Agreement and each applicable Security Document in the manner
provided therein within three Business Days after such Subsidiary is formed or

Subsidiary's assets (other than commercial delivery vehicles and leasehold
interests in Stores) to secure the Obligations as the Administrative Agent or
the Required Lenders shall reasonably request and (b) if any Equity Interests or
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary are owned by or on behalf of any Loan Party,
Holdings and the Borrower will cause such Equity Interests and promissory notes
evidencing such Indebtedness to be pledged pursuant to the Pledge Agreement
within three Business Days after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired (except
that, if such Subsidiary is a Foreign Subsidiary and is not a Subsidiary Loan
Party, Equity Interests of such Subsidiary to be pledged pursuant to the Pledge
Agreement may be limited to 65% of the outstanding voting Equity Interests of
such Subsidiary).

          SECTION 5.13.  Further Assurances. (a) Each of Holdings and the
Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary Loan Party to, execute any and all
further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take
all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing
statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents),
which may be required under any applicable law, or which the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably request, to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or to grant, preserve, protect
or perfect the Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents
or the validity or priority of any such Lien, all at the expense of the Loan
Parties. Holdings and the Borrower also agree to provide to the Administrative
Agent, from time to time upon request, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent as to the perfection and priority of the Liens created or
intended to be created by the Security Documents.

          (b) If any material assets (including any real property or
improvements thereto or any interest therein) are acquired by the Borrower or
any Subsidiary Loan Party after the Effective Date (other than assets
constituting Collateral under the Security Agreement that become subject to the
Lien of the Security Agreement upon acquisition thereof), the Borrower will
notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof, and, if requested by
the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, the Borrower will cause such
assets to be subjected to a Lien securing the Obligations and will take, and
cause the Subsidiary Loan Parties to take, such actions as shall be necessary or

<PAGE>

                                                                              88

reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to grant and perfect such
Liens, including actions described in paragraph (a) of this Section, all at the
expense of the Loan Parties; provided that the foregoing shall not require the
Borrower to grant a Lien on assets constituting commercial delivery vehicles,
leasehold interests in Stores or Vehicles owned by the Vehicle Subsidiary.

          (c) If any Mortgaged Property set forth on Schedule 1.01(b) and
identified with an asterisk is not sold prior to the date that is one year after
the Effective Date, the Borrower shall, within 60 days of such date, deliver to
the Administrative Agent a policy or policies of title insurance (or binding
commitments to issue such title policies), or a title endorsement to an existing
title policy, issued by a nationally recognized title insurance company,
insuring the Lien of each Mortgage with respect to each such Mortgaged Property
as a valid first Lien on such Mortgaged Property, free of any other Liens except
as permitted by Section 6.02, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Collateral Agent, together with such endorsements, coinsurance and reinsurance
as the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably request.

         than those specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of this Article), and
         such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after
         notice thereof from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which
         notice will be given at the request of any Lender);

                  (f) Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall fail to
         make any payment (whether of principal or interest and regardless of
         amount) in respect of any Material Indebtedness, when and as the same
         shall become due and payable;

                  (g) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
         Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that
         enables or permits (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of
         time or both) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any
         trustee or agent on its or their behalf to cause any Material
         Indebtedness to become due, or to require the prepayment, repurchase,
         redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity;
         provided that this clause (g) shall not apply to secured Indebtedness
         that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the
         property or assets securing such Indebtedness;

                  (h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an
         involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation,
         reorganization or other relief in respect of Holdings, the Borrower or
         any Subsidiary or its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets,
         under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency,
         receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the
         appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator,
         conservator or similar official for Holdings, the Borrower or any
         Subsidiary or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such
         case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed for 60
         days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing
         shall be entered;

                  (i) Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall (i)
         voluntarily commence any proceeding or file any petition seeking
         liquidation, reorganization or other relief under any Federal, state or
         foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or
         hereafter in effect, (ii) consent to the institution

         proceeding or petition described in clause (h) of this Article, (iii)
         apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee,

         filed against it in any such proceeding, (v) make a general assignment
         for the benefit of creditors or (vi) take any action for the purpose of
         effecting any of the foregoing;

                  (j) Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall become
         unable, admit in writing its inability or fail generally to pay its
         debts as they become due;

                  (k) one or more judgments for the payment of money in an
         aggregate amount in excess of $5,000,000 shall be rendered against
         Holdings, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any combination thereof and
         the same shall remain undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days
         during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, or any action
         shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor (and such action is not
         effectively stayed) to attach or levy upon any assets of Holdings, the
         Borrower or any Subsidiary to enforce any such judgment;

                  (l) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of
         the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events
         that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in liability
         of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount exceeding
         (i) $3,000,000 in any year or (ii) $5,000,000 for all periods;

                  (m) any Lien purported to be created under any Security
         Document shall cease to be, or shall be asserted by any Loan Party not
         to be, a valid and perfected Lien on any Collateral, with the priority
         required by the applicable Security Document, except (i) as a result of
         the sale or other disposition of the applicable Collateral in a
         transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or (ii) as a result of
         the Collateral Agent's failure to maintain possession of any stock
         certificates, promissory notes or other instruments delivered to it
         under the Pledge Agreement;

                  (n) a Change in Control shall occur;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower
described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the
request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take either or
both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)
declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part,
in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter
be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any
event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this
Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the
Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and
other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

                  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder.

                                                                             112

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the
Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing
by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c)
except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to Holdings, the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by Holdings, the Borrower or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain
or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report
or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by

<PAGE>

                                                                             113

it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower (except that no consultation is required during
an Event of Default), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder
or thereunder.

                  The provisions of this Article applicable to the
Administrative Agent also shall apply to the Collateral Agent, mutatis mutandis.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that neither of the Documentation
Agents has any right, duty or liability under any Loan Document in its capacity
as Documentation Agent.

                                  Miscellaneous

                  SECTION 9.01. Notices. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and
other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be
delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

                  (a) if to Holdings or the Borrower, to Advance Stores Company,

         Manor Drive, 4th Floor, Tampa, Florida 33610, Attention of Standby LC
         Department (Telecopy No. (813) 432-5161);

                  (d) if to the Swingline Lender, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, Loan

         and

                  (e) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy
         number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

                  SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default
at the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case
of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an

<PAGE>

                                                                             116

agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent or
the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or
reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the
scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of
each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner
that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the
written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section
or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan
Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any
Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release
Holdings or any Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Guarantee
Agreement (except as expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement), or limit
its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each
Lender, (vii) except in strict accordance with the express provisions thereof,
release all or any substantial part of the Collateral from the Liens of the
Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) change
any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely
affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any
Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the
written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding
Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class (in addition to any other
consent required under this paragraph), (ix) amend, modify or waive any
condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 with respect to the making of
Revolving Loans, without the written consent of Revolving Lenders holding a
majority in interest of the Revolving Commitments or (x) change the rights of
the Tranche B Lenders to decline mandatory prepayments as provided in Section
2.11, without the written consent of Tranche B Lenders holding a majority of the
outstanding Tranche B Loans; provided further that (A) no such agreement shall
amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties

<PAGE>

                                                                             117

of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may
be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its
terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Revolving Lenders
(but not any other Lenders), the Tranche A Lenders or the Tranche B Lenders (but
not any other Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and requisite percentage in interest of
the affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under
this Section if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder
at the time. In furtherance of clause (ix) of this Section 9.02(b), (i) any
amendment or modification to or waiver of Section 6.12, 6.13, 6.14 or 6.15 of
this Agreement or (ii) any amendment or modification to or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document at a time when any
Default has occurred and is continuing, and that would have the effect of
eliminating any such Default, shall not be deemed to be effective for purposes
of determining whether the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 to the
making of any Revolving Loan have been satisfied unless the Revolving Lenders
holding a majority in interest of the Revolving Commitments shall have consented
to such amendment, modification or waiver; provided that the foregoing shall not
be construed to affect any amendment or modification to any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than any amendment or modification
to Section 6.12, 6.13, 6.14 or 6.15 of this Agreement) if no Default has
occurred and is continuing at the time of such amendment or modification.

                  SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Agents and their respective Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Agents, in connection with the syndication
of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration
of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the
provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and
(iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges
and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender,

<PAGE>

                                                                             118

in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection
with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in
connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including
all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Agents, the Issuing Bank
and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each
such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related
expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any
Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan
Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand
for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection
with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property currently or formerly
owned or operated by Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to Holdings, the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, except that this clause (iii) shall not apply to Environmental
Liabilities related to a Mortgaged Property that are attributable solely to acts
or events occurring after completion of foreclosure proceedings with respect to
such Mortgaged Property and surrender of possession thereof by the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries to or as directed by the Collateral Agent or the purchasers at
any such foreclosure sale, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative

                                                                             119

Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the
time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of
such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing
Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a
Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of
the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at
the time.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither
Holdings nor the Borrower shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or
Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that
(i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy

or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b)(i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph
(b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                           (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the
                  Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an
                  Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of
                  Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has
                  occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and

                           (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no
                  consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an
                  assignment of (x) any Revolving Commitment to an assignee that
                  is a Lender with a Revolving Commitment immediately prior to
                  giving effect to such assignment or (y) all or any portion of
                  a Term Loan.

                  (ii)     Assignments shall be subject to the following
        additional conditions:

                           (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender
                  or an Affiliate or Approved Fund of a Lender or an assignment
                  of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
                  Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment
                  or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
                  assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
                  Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
                  Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless
                  each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
                  consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall
                  be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h)
                  or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing;

                           (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an
                  assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
                  Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided
                  that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the
                  assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
                  Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of

<PAGE>

                                                                             121

                  Commitments or Loans;

                           (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
                  deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
                  Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of
                  $3,500 (except in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate or
                  Approved Fund of a Lender); and

                           (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
         deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

                  For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved
Fund" has the following meaning:

                  "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person)
that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and
similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is
administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an
entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                  (iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant
         to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
         specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder
         shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by
         such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a
         Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
         to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
         Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and,
         in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
         Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
         entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any
         assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
         Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated
         for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
         participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
         paragraph (c) of this Section.

                  (iv)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as
         an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy
         of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for
         the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,

<PAGE>

                                                                             122

         and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC
         Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
         time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
         conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
         the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
         purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
         Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing
         Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
         reasonable prior notice.

                  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
         Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
         assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee
         shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation
         fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written
         consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section,
         the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption
         and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
         assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it
         has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (c)(i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower,
     the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell
     participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in
     all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this
     Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing
     to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
     shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to
     the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C)
     the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other
     Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
     connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
     Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
     participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
     enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver
     of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or
     instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of
     the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described
     in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
     Subject to paragraph (c)(ii)

<PAGE>

                                                                             123

     of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
     entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent
     as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant
     to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
     Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as
     though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
     Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

                  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
         greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender
         would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
         sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
         Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A
         Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall
         not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is
         notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
         Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
         Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
     interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
     obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or
     assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this
     Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security
     interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest
     shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute
     any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
     any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding
     vehicle (an "SPV"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the
     Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to
     provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting
     Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to
     this Agreement, provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a
     commitment by any SPV to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to
     exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such
     Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to
     the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize
     the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such
     Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby

<PAGE>

                                                                             124

     agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment
     obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with
     the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
     hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
     Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
     payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior
     indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other
     person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization,
     arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the
     United States of America or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary in this Section 9.04, any SPV may (i) with notice
     to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the
     Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign
     all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to
     any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and the
     Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for
     the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and
     (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating
     to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of
     any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV. As
     this Section 9.04(e) applies to any particular SPV, this Section may not be
     amended without the written consent of such SPV.

                  SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements,
     representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan
     Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in
     connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
     shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto
     and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the
     making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of
     any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
     notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
     Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
     or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
     hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
     principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other
     amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter
     of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or
     terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and
     Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless
     of the consummation of the transactions

<PAGE>

                                                                             125

     contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
     termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination
     of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
     Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto
     on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but
     all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This
     Agreement, the other Loan Document and any separate letter agreements with
     respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire
     contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
     supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or
     written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become
     effective as provided in the Amendment and Restatement Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement
     held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as
     to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity,
     illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and
     enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a
     particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
     provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall
     have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is
     hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
     permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
     special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
     obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the
     credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the
     obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
     held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have
     made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
     unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to
     other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such
     Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service
     of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
     governed by the law of the State of New York.

<PAGE>

                                                                             126

                  (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
     unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
     jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New
     York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern
     District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
     action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or
     for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties
     hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
     respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
     such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal
     court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
     action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
     jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
     law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any
     right that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank
     or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating
     to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the Borrower
     or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
     unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
     effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
     laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
     relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred
     to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
     irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of
     an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
     any such court.

                  (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
     service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01.
     Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right
     of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
     permitted by law.

                  SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
     WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
     HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
     ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR
     THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
     ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
     AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF

                                                                             127

     ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
     PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
     WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
     INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
     WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the
     Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are
     not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be
     taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
     Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
     confidentiality of the Information (as defined below) in accordance with
     their customary procedures, except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
     its and its Affiliates' and Approved Funds' directors, officers, employees
     and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it
     being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
     informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to
     keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any
     regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
     regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other
     party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
     remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
     Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder
     or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
     substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of or
     Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of
     its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the
     Borrower, (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
     other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes
     available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a
     nonconfidential basis from a source other than Holdings or the Borrower or
     (i) to any creditor or direct or indirect contractual counterparty with a
     Lender or its affiliates in a swap agreement or such counterparty's
     professional advisor (so long as such creditor contractual counterparty or
     professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to be bound by
     the provisions of this Section 9.12). For the purposes of this Section,
     "Information" means all information received from Holdings or the Borrower
     relating to Holdings or the Borrower or its business, other than any such
     information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank

     basis prior to disclosure by Holdings or the Borrower; provided that, in
     the case of information received from Holdings or the Borrower after the
     Effective Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of
     delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
     confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
     considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
     exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
     Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential
     information. Nothing in this Section 9.12 is intended to prohibit any
     Lender (or any Affiliate or Approved Fund of any Lender) from acquiring or
     disposing of any of the Borrower's debt securities from or to an
     institutional "accredited investor" (as defined in Regulation D under the
     Securities Act of 1933); provided that in connection with any such
     acquisition or disposition, such Lender (or Affiliate or Approved Fund of
     such Lender) shall not disclose to its trade counterparty or any other
     Person any Information relating to the Borrower except in accordance with
     this Section 9.12.

                  SECTION 9.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
     anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate
     applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts
     which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law
     (collectively, the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the
     "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or
     reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law,
     the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together
     with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
     Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would
     have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result
     of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
     Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall
     be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated
     amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate
     to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                  SECTION 9.14. Existing Credit Agreement; Effectiveness of
     Amendment and Restatement. Until this Agreement becomes effective in
     accordance with the terms of the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the
     Existing Credit Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
     not be affected hereby. After the Restatement Effective Date, all
     obligations of the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement shall
     become obligations of the Borrower hereunder, secured by the Security
     Documents, and the

     provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement shall be superseded by the

Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the
