<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>FOREWORD    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott's Liquid Gold-Inc.&nbsp;&amp; Affiliated Companies intends for this Plan to be permanent, but since future conditions affecting your employer
cannot be anticipated or foreseen, Scott's Liquid Gold-Inc.&nbsp;&amp; Affiliated Companies reserves the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Plan at any time, which may result in the
termination or modification of your coverage. Expenses incurred prior to the Plan termination will be paid as provided under the terms of the Plan prior to its termination. Changes in the Plan may
occur in any or all parts of the Plan including, but not limited to, benefit coverage, deductibles, maximums, coinsurance, exclusions, definitions, eligibility and the like. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
employer has initiated the Plan to provide benefits for its employees and their eligible dependents, and it shall be maintained for this exclusive purpose. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
employer desires to provide a health care benefit plan that financially assists employees and dependents with health care expenses and provides affordable care. While part of
increasing health care costs result from new technology and important medical advances, another significant cause is the way health care services are used. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Employee benefits are affected by certain limitations and conditions which require the employee to be a wise consumer of health services and to use only those
services he or she needs.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
studies indicate that a high percentage of the cost for health care services may be unnecessary. For example, hospital stays can be longer than necessary. Some hospitalizations may
be entirely avoidable, such as when surgery could be performed at an outpatient facility with equal safety. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative
care at home, other alternative methods of treatment, or medical care not otherwise covered under the Plan may be suggested to patients for which additional inpatient care is
medically necessary. This allows the patient to be discharged from the hospital sooner than would otherwise be possible, providing a savings to the employee and the Plan while maintaining care equal
to a hospital confinement. </FONT></P>

<A NAME="toc_kl1489_3"> </A>
<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee Benefit Health and Welfare Plan as summarized in this booklet is provided through a combination of insured and self-funded benefits. This
booklet describes your Health and Welfare Plan in an easily understood manner and is both the Plan Document and the Summary Plan Description. The following are summaries of the Medical, Dental, Vision
and Prescription Drug benefits provided by the Plan. It does not, however, create or confer any rights, as it merely summarizes some of the essential provisions of the Plan and may not describe your
particular circumstances. Your eligibility and coverage is subject to all the terms, provisions, and conditions that are contained in this Document. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan is intended to be consistent with any contracts for policies of insurance under which the contributions are made, and with any contracts for medical review services. To the
extent the terms of the Plan are inconsistent with such contracts, the terms of such contracts shall prevail. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan will not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment or give any person the right to be retained in the service of the employer or to interfere with the right of the
employer to discharge or otherwise terminate the employment of any person. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan Administrator shall perform its duties as the Plan Administrator and in its sole discretion shall determine appropriate courses of action in light of the
reason and purpose for which the Plan is established and maintained. In particular, the Plan Administrator shall have full and sole discretionary
authority to interpret all plan documents and to make all interpretive and factual determinations as to whether any individual is entitled to receive any benefit under the terms of this Plan. Any
construction of the terms of any plan document and any determination of fact adopted by the Plan Administrator shall be final and legally binding on all parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
interpretation, determination or other action of the Plan Administrator shall be subject to review only if it is arbitrary and capricious or otherwise an abuse of discretion. Any
review of a final decision or action of the Plan Administrator shall be based only on such evidence presented to or considered by the Plan Administrator at the time it made the decision that is the
subject of review. Accepting any benefits or making any claim for benefits under this Plan constitutes agreement with and consent to any decisions that the Plan Administrator makes, in its sole
discretion and, further, constitutes agreement to the limited standard and scope of review described by this section. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan will pay the employee a cash bonus if he/she finds an overcharge on a hospital bill (excluding double billings and very obvious mistakes which would be
caught during claims processing).The overcharge must be for a covered expense. To receive the bonus, the employee must follow the following procedures: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within
five (5)&nbsp;working days of receiving your hospital bill, call Mountain States Administration at 303-360-9600 or
1-800-828-8847 to inform them that you have found an error(s) in the bill. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>This must be done before the hospital bill has been processed by
Mountain States Administration.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next,
within the same five (5)&nbsp;day period, you must follow up with a letter to Mountain States Administration explaining how or why the bill is in error. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
the error is confirmed with the hospital by Mountain States Administration and a corrected bill is received, you will receive your audit savings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document is a description of Scott's Liquid Gold&nbsp;&amp; Affiliated Companies Employee Benefit Health and Welfare Plan ("the Plan"). No oral interpretations
can change this Plan. This self-funded health and welfare Plan is designed to protect covered persons against catastrophic health expenses. The purpose of this Plan Document and Summary
Plan Description is to state the terms, provisions, conditions, limitations and exclusions of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-funding
means that Scott's Liquid Gold-Inc. has established an employee benefit Plan to reimburse you for covered medical expenses. The
self-funded Plan is reinsured with a major insurance company to limit the liability of the self-funded Plan for catastrophic individual or group claims. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage
under the Plan will take effect for an eligible employee and designated dependents when the employee and such dependents satisfy the waiting period and all the eligibility
requirements of the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan will pay benefits only for the expenses incurred while this coverage is in force. No benefits are payable for expenses incurred before coverage began or after coverage
terminated, even if the expenses were incurred as a result of an accident, injury or disease that occurred, began, or existed while coverage was in force. An expense for a service or supply is
incurred on the date the service or supply is furnished. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>HOW THE MEDICAL PLAN WORKS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Plan provides health care coverage under two options: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>The
Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) option. The Plan's PPOs are Sloans Lake Managed Care and MultiPlan. The PPOs are groups of participating physicians and hospitals that provide
services for which benefits are paid at special levels, often with lower fees and resulting in lower calendar year out-of-pocket maximum expenses. You can contact Sloans Lake
Managed Care at (303)&nbsp;591-2200 or (800)&nbsp;850-2249 or on their website at www.sloanslake.com and MultiPlan at (800)&nbsp;546-3887 or on their website
at www.multiplan.com.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>2.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>The
Non-Preferred Provider (Non-PPO) option. This is coverage where covered persons go to any provider of their choice and the
out-of-pocket expenses are usually higher because there are no discounts to the Plan from Non-PPO providers. Covered persons have the choice of selecting either the
PPO option (Participating) or the Non-PPO (Non-Participating) option, or a combination of both options, for medical care. See the Schedule of Medical Benefits for a summary of
benefits, and see specific sections of the Plan for more information. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>HOW THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN WORKS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan has contracted with Express Scripts to administer the pharmacy drug plan using a nationwide network of participating retail pharmacies in order to charge
covered persons reduced fees for covered pharmacy drugs. The Plan also provides a mail order drug benefit option for long-term, maintenance medications available directly from Express
Scripts. Please see the Prescription Drug Plan section for a listing of benefits and copayments, and see the section on the Prescription Drug Plan for more information. You can contact Express Scripts
toll free at (888)&nbsp;201-5863 for Member Rx Services, or Pharmacy Help Desk (800)&nbsp;763-5550 or on their website at: www.express-scripts.com. </FONT></P>

usual, customary, and reasonable for the area in which services are rendered. Charges excluded as not covered, over usual, customary, and reasonable or as otherwise noted, do not count toward either
deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. This is a summary of benefits only; for specific restrictions and limitations, see detailed explanations elsewhere in the Plan. The Plan
has entered into arrangements with Sloans Lake Managed Care for covered persons in Colorado and MultiPlan for covered persons living or traveling outside Colorado. The preferred provider organizations

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a covered person incurs covered dental expenses, the Schedule of Dental Benefits set forth in this Plan shall apply. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>MAXIMUM BENEFIT AMOUNT  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount payable for all covered expenses incurred for a covered person in a calendar year will not be more than the maximum benefit amount shown in the
Schedule of Dental Benefits ($2,000 per calendar year per covered person). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>DENTAL ELIGIBILITY  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If dental coverage is desired, the employee must enroll within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of date of hire. Benefits will be effective the first working day following
ninety (90)&nbsp;days of full-time employment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
an employee does not enroll for dental benefits within this time frame and subsequently desires coverage, there is a twelve (12)&nbsp;month waiting period before any benefits are
payable, except for accidental injuries to sound, natural teeth. Refer to Late Entrant Provision (For Dental Benefits). All other enrollment procedures follow the guidelines outlined under the
Eligibility section on page 18. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>DENTAL PRE-NOTIFICATION OF BENEFITS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When charges for dental treatment (other than emergency treatment) are expected to exceed $250 for you or any of your dependents, it is strongly recommended that
you pre-notify the Plan before treatment begins. The Claims Administrator will estimate which charges will be payable under
the Plan and return the estimate to the dentist. This procedure allows the dentist to make financial arrangements with you for payment of charges not covered under the Plan, or to make necessary
adjustments to the proposed treatment plan. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single coverage maximum calendar year deductible for both medical and dental expenses combined is $200. Family coverage maximum calendar year deductible for both
medical and dental expenses combined is $400. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>LATE ENTRANT PROVISION (FOR DENTAL BENEFITS)  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee did not elect coverage for himself or herself and/or his or her eligible dependents within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the employee's date of
full-time hire, benefits will be limited as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
benefits will be payable, except for accidental injuries to sound, natural teeth, until the person has been covered under the Plan for twelve (12)&nbsp;consecutive months. Treatment
for injuries to sound, natural teeth are covered under the Medical Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
dental waiting period for the late entrant, as described above, must be reduced by the period of creditable coverage the individual has under any previous dental plan as of the
enrollment date. Refer to Creditable Coverage on page 94. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>QUALIFIED MEDICAL CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS (QMCSOs)  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following information sets forth the procedures to be followed by the Plan to administer "Qualified Medical Child Support Orders" (QMCSOs), including National
Medical Support Notices, as required by Section&nbsp;609(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the employer determines that the eligible employee's separated or divorced spouse or any state child support agency or Medicaid agency has obtained a legal medical child support order
(MCSO), through a court order or an administrative process established under state law, and if the current Plan offers dependent coverage, the eligible employee will be required to provide coverage
for any child(ren) named in the MCSO if the order is deemed to be "qualified." If dependent coverage is not normally offered under the Plan or the Employee is not eligible to participate, then no
coverage for such child(ren) can be offered under this Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
QMCSO is a court judgment, decree, or order, or a state administrative order that has the force and effect of law, that is typically issued as part of a divorce or as part of a state
child support order proceeding, and that requires health plan coverage for an "alternate recipient." An alternate recipient is either the child of an eligible employee or a state or political
subdivision acting on behalf of such child. Federal law requires a group health plan to pay benefits in accordance with such an order, if it is deemed "qualified." A QMCSO may apply to a health plan,
dental plan, vision plan and/or health care spending account. It requires that the child(ren) named in the order have the right to receive benefits from the eligible employee through any group medical
plan under which the eligible Employee is enrolled, whether or not the eligible employee has family coverage. The QMCSO must contain: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
the alternate recipient is a newborn or newly-adopted child, the Plan's pre-existing conditions limitations will apply to an alternative recipient under a QMCSO to the

coverage for himself/herself (if not already enrolled) and for the child(ren) who is an alternate recipient in the order within the time periods specified under the Eligibility section of this

the eligible employee (if not already enrolled) and the child(ren) upon application from the separated/divorced spouse, the state child support agency or Medicaid agency and withhold from the
employee's pay for the eligible employee's share of the cost of such coverage. If the employee is not eligible for coverage under this Plan, then no coverage can be offered under this Plan for such
child(ren) and/or Employee regardless of the Order. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
coverage becomes effective, the eligible employee may not drop coverage for the child(ren) unless he/she submits written evidence to the employer that the child support order is no

Plan may make direct benefit payments for the child(ren) covered by a QMCSO directly to the custodial parent or legal guardian for such child(ren). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
named child will be considered a covered person under this Plan but may designate another person, such as a custodial parent or legal guardian, to receive copies of explanations of

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
it is determined that the order is not a "Qualified" order, each named child may appeal that decision by submitting a written letter of appeal to the Plan Administrator. The Plan
Administrator shall review the appeal and reply in writing within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt of the appeal. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans
are not required to provide coverage in accordance with child support or other court orders which are NOT "qualified." The Plan Administrator has the ultimate authority to
determine whether or not the order meets all the requirement of ERISA's Section&nbsp;609(a). If the order does not meet all of the qualification requirements, the Plan need not (and should not)
provide any benefits to the alternate recipient, unless the child is otherwise eligible or deficiencies are later corrected by the parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This

provision overrides any and all Plan provisions as to the determination of eligibility for coverage, except when dependent coverage under the Plan is not normally offered or the
employee is not eligible for coverage under the Plan. For example, if coverage under the Plan normally ceases when a dependent child attains age nineteen (19), but under state law requires coverage
until the child attains age twenty-one (21), the Plan must go to age twenty-one (21). It is assumed that all states are at age nineteen (19), except

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical benefits are provided for surgeries resulting from illness or accidental bodily injury. The maximum amount of payment for a particular surgery is based
upon the usual, customary, and reasonable surgical charge (UCR). The definition of UCR is on page 86. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
than one (1)&nbsp;surgery performed by one (1)&nbsp;or more physicians during the course of only one (1)&nbsp;operative period is called a "multiple surgery." Because
allowances for surgery include benefits for pre- and post-surgical care, total benefits for multiple surgeries are reduced so that pre- and post-surgery
allowances of the major surgery are not duplicated. The reduced benefits vary, depending upon the circumstances of the multiple surgery. Variables include the number of incisions required, the
location of the incision and the complexity of each surgical procedure. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), requires that most employers sponsoring a group health plan ("Plan") offer
employees and their families covered under their health plan the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage (called "COBRA continuation coverage") in certain instances where coverage
under the Plan would otherwise end. This notice is intended to inform covered persons and beneficiaries, in summary fashion, of the rights and obligations under the continuation coverage provisions of
COBRA, as amended and reflected in final and proposed regulations published by the Department of the Treasury. This notice is intended to reflect the law and does not grant or take away any rights
under the law. Complete instructions on COBRA, as well as election forms and other information, will be provided by the Plan Administrator to covered persons who become qualified beneficiaries under
COBRA. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COBRA continuation coverage is group health insurance coverage that an employer must offer to certain covered persons and their eligible family members (called
"qualified beneficiaries") at group rates for up to a statutory-mandated maximum period of time or until they become ineligible for COBRA continuation coverage, whichever occurs first. The right to
COBRA continuation coverage is triggered by the occurrence of one of certain enumerated events that result in the loss of coverage under the terms of the employer's Plan (the "qualifying Event"). The
coverage must be identical to the Plan coverage that the qualified beneficiary had immediately before the qualifying Event, or if the coverage has been changed, the coverage must be identical to the
coverage provided to similarly situated active employees who have not experienced a qualifying event (in other words, similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>QUALIFIED BENEFICIARY  </I></B></FONT></P>

of applicable law, then the individual will be considered to have had the Plan coverage and will be considered a qualified beneficiary if that individual experiences a qualifying event.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the qualifying event causes the covered employee, or the spouse or a dependent child of the covered employee, to cease to be covered under the Plan under the same terms and conditions
as in effect immediately before the qualifying event (or in the case of the bankruptcy of the employer, any
substantial elimination of coverage under the Plan occurring within twelve (12)&nbsp;months before or after the date the bankruptcy proceeding commences), the persons losing such coverage become

taking of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA") does not constitute a qualifying event. A qualifying event occurs, however, if an employee does not return to
employment at the end of the FMLA leave and all other COBRA continuation coverage conditions are present. If a qualifying event occurs, it occurs on the earlier of: a)&nbsp;the last day of FMLA
leave if the employee is not returning to employment; or b)&nbsp;the date the employee gives notice to the employer that he/she will not be returning to employment. The applicable maximum coverage
period is measured from this date (unless coverage is lost at a later date and the Plan provides for the extension of the required periods, in which case the maximum coverage period is measured from
the date when the coverage is lost). Note that the covered employee and family members will be entitled to COBRA continuation coverage even if they fail to pay the employee portion of premiums for
coverage under the Plan during the FMLA leave as long as they were covered on the day before the first day of the leave or become covered during the FMLA leave. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>COBRA ELECTION PERIOD  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An election period is the time period within which the qualified beneficiary can elect COBRA continuation coverage under the employer's Plan. A Plan can condition
availability of COBRA continuation coverage upon the timely election of such coverage. An election of COBRA continuation coverage is a timely election if it is made during the election period. The
election period must begin not later than the date the qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event and must not end before the date that is sixty (60)&nbsp;days
after the later of: the date the qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event, or the date notice is provided to the qualified beneficiary of her or his rights to elect
COBRA continuation coverage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>NOTIFICATION OF QUALIFYING EVENT  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the employer or Plan Administrator must determine when a qualifying event has occurred. However, each covered employee or qualified Beneficiary is
responsible for notifying the Plan Administrator of the occurrence of a qualifying event that is: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>A

<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>2.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>he

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan is not required to offer the qualified beneficiary an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage if the notice is not provided to the Plan Administrator within sixty
(60)&nbsp;days after the later of: the date of the qualifying event, or the date the qualified Beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>WAIVER OF COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, during the sixty (60)&nbsp;day election period, a qualified beneficiary waives COBRA continuation coverage, the waiver can be revoked at any time before the
end of the election period. Revocation of the waiver is an election of COBRA continuation coverage. However, if a waiver is revoked during the election period, coverage will not be provided
retroactively (i.e.,&nbsp;back to the date of the loss of coverage until the waiver is revoked). Coverage will only be provided beginning on the date the waiver is revoked. Waivers and revocations
of waivers are considered made on the date they are sent to the employer or Plan Administrator, as applicable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>TERMINATION OF COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election period, a qualified beneficiary may waive COBRA continuation coverage. Except for an interruption of coverage in connection with a waiver,
COBRA continuation coverage that has been elected for a qualified beneficiary must extend for at least the period beginning the date of the qualifying event or the date coverage is lost, whichever is
later, and ending not before the earliest of the following dates: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>COBRA DISABILITY EXTENSION  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disability extension will be granted if an individual (whether or not the covered employee) who is a qualified beneficiary in connection with the qualifying
event that is a termination or reduction of hours of a covered employee's employment, is determined under Title&nbsp;II or XVI of the Social Security Act to have been disabled at any time during the

require the payment of an amount that does not exceed 150% of the applicable premium for any period of COBRA continuation coverage covering a disabled qualified beneficiary that would not be required
to be made available in the absence of a disability extension. A group health plan can terminate a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage as of the first day of any period for which

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coordination of benefits provision is intended to prevent the payment of benefits which exceed expenses. It applies when the employee or any eligible
dependent who are covered by the Plan are also covered by any other plan or plans, excluding an individual insurance policy. When more than one (1)&nbsp;coverage exists, one (1)&nbsp;plan normally
pays its benefits in full and the other plan pays a reduced benefit. Only the amount paid by the Plan will be charged against the Plan maximums. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event of a motor vehicle or premises accident, this Plan is not the primary coverage. This includes, but is not limited to auto, medical, no-fault, homeowners'
insurance or medical payment coverage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan will always pay either its benefits in full or a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the other plan or plans, will not exceed 100% of total allowable
expenses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable
expense means a necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care when the item of expense is covered, at least in part, by one (1)&nbsp;or more plans
covering the individual for whom the claim is made. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, then the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be
deemed to be both an allowable expense and a benefit paid. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
coordination of benefits provision applies whether or not a claim is filed under the other plan or plans. If needed, authorization must be given to this Plan to obtain information as
to benefits or services available from the other plan or plans, or to recover overpayments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "Plan" as used in this section of Coordination of Benefits will mean any plan providing benefits or services for or by reason of medical, vision, or

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan beneficiary agrees to recognize the Plan's right to subrogation and reimbursement. These rights provide the Plan with a first priority over any funds,
full or partial, that the Plan beneficiary settles for, recovers or is reimbursed by a third party or coverage to a covered person relative to the injury or illness, including a first priority over
any claim for non-medical or dental charges, attorney fees, or other costs and expenses. The Plan beneficiary agrees to hold any such funds received, regardless if it is a full or partial
recovery amount, in trust for the benefit of the Plan, and to reimburse the Plan for all benefits paid or that will be paid as a result of said injury or illness, regardless of whether the Plan
beneficiary has not received compensation for all of his or her damages or is not made whole. If the Plan beneficiary fails to reimburse the Plan for all benefits paid or to be paid, as a result of
said injury or illness, out of any and all recovery or reimbursement received, the Plan beneficiary will be liable for any and all expenses (whether fees or costs) associated with the Plan's attempt
to recover such money from the Plan beneficiary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plan beneficiary decides to pursue a third party or any Coverage available to him/her as a result of said injury or illness, the Plan beneficiary agrees to
include the Plan's subrogation claim in that action and if there is a failure to do so the Plan will be legally presumed to be included in such action or recovery. The Plan shall not be liable for any
expenses in connection with the recovery (whether fees or costs) of monies unless the Plan shall have agreed in advance in writing to bear a portion or all of the expense thereof. Should a Plan
beneficiary undertake negotiations or file&nbsp;a lawsuit to recover any kind of damages from any third party or Coverage who may be liable for the expenses paid by the Plan, then the Plan
beneficiary shall, first, notify the Plan Administrator and, second, notify his or her attorney of the Plan's rights and the subrogation trust and lien created by this provision. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event the Plan beneficiary fails to pursue his or her remedy or claim against any potentially liable third party or Coverage, then the Plan shall be subrogated to all rights of
such Plan beneficiary so that such rights or claims may be prosecuted, compromised, or settled by the Plan in the Plan beneficiary's name at the Plan's sole discretion. If any such action is taken by
the Plan, then the Plan beneficiary authorizes the Plan to execute any and all documents necessary to pursue said claims in the Plan beneficiary's name, and the Plan beneficiary agrees to fully
cooperate with the Plan in the prosecution of any such claims. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan beneficiary agrees to take no prejudicial actions against the subrogation rights of the Plan or to in any way impede the action taken by the Plan to recover its subrogation
claim. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cooperation of the Plan beneficiary shall include a duty to provide information, execute and deliver any acknowledgement and other legal instruments documenting the Plan's
subrogation rights and take such action as requested by the Plan to secure the subrogation rights of the Plan. The Plan beneficiary agrees and acknowledges that they will respond within ten
(10)&nbsp;days to all inquiries of the Plan regarding the status of any claim that they may have against any third parties or Coverage including, but not limited to, no-fault, uninsured
and underinsured. Inquiries by the Plan may include, but are not limited to, requests for accident reports, names and addresses of other parties involved in the accident or occurrence and potential
witnesses, information regarding other insurance policies that may apply, including the name and address of agents and adjusters for those insurance policies, information regarding offers of
settlement from third parties or their insurers and information regarding any legal proceedings related to the accident or occurrence. The Plan beneficiary shall notify the Plan immediately of the
name and address of any attorney whom the Plan beneficiary engages to pursue any personal injury claim on their behalf. </FONT></P>

available under the Plan for review of claims which are denied in whole or in part (i.e., appeals process). These procedures are as specified by the Department of Labor (DOL) Claims Regulations and
required by Section&nbsp;102(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Per
the DOL Claims Regulations, all ERISA plans must establish and maintain reasonable claims procedures. The basic structure of any claims procedure involves: 1)&nbsp;a claim for
benefits by a plan covered person or beneficiary or by an authorized representative; 2)&nbsp;a benefit determination by the plan; 3)&nbsp;any appeal by the claimant or authorized representative of
an adverse determination; and 4)&nbsp;the determination on review by the plan. </FONT></P>

information necessary to decide the claim, the time for the benefit determination is "tolled" (i.e., suspended) from the date the extension notice is sent until the date the claimant responds to the
request for additional information. The claimant shall be given forty-five (45)&nbsp;calendar days from receipt of the notice to supply the additional
information. If the claimant never responds, the time for determination never restarts. However, in the interests of finality, if the additional information is not received within the
forty-five (45)&nbsp;days, the claimant shall be notified that the claim is denied. </FONT></P>

determination, if applicable, must be made within a reasonable period of time, but no more than thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
15-calendar-day extension may be made if "matters beyond control of the Plan" require it (e.g., filing of an incomplete claim or failing to provide a required
authorization form for a claim filed by an authorized representative) if proper notice is given to the claimant. The extension notice shall indicate the matters beyond the control of the Plan that
give rise to the need for the extension and the date by which a determination is expected to be made. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the post-service claim that is filed is incomplete, the benefit determination period is suspended ("tolled") from the date the extension notice is sent until the date the
claimant responds to the request for additional information up to at least forty-five (45)&nbsp;calendar days. If the claimant never responds, the time for determination never restarts.
However, in the interests of finality, if the additional information is not received within the forty-five (45)&nbsp;days, the claimant shall be notified that the claim is denied. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent
Care Decision&#151;When the Plan has approved an ongoing course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or number of treatments, any decision to reduce or
terminate the course of treatment (other than by Plan amendment or Plan termination) before the end of the period of number of treatments shall be treated as an adverse benefit determination.
Notification of such a concurrent care decision must be given to the affected Plan covered person or beneficiary in sufficient time to allow an appeal and determination on review before the treatment
is terminated or reduced. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan has established and maintains an appeals procedure for adverse benefit determinations under which claimants receive full and fair review of the claim and
the adverse benefit determination. The purpose of the "full and fair review" requirement is to provide claimants with enough information to prepare adequately for further administrative review or an
appeal to the federal courts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan's claims procedures include administrative processes and safeguards designed to ensure and to verify that benefit claim determinations are made in
accordance with governing Plan documents and that, where appropriate, the Plan provisions have been applied consistently with respect to similarly-situated claimants. </FONT></P>

denials on appeal and the Plan provisions implicated; 3)&nbsp;keep an index of decisions by medical procedure (e.g.,&nbsp;medical necessity, experimental/investigational exclusions, fertility
exclusion, etc.); and 4)&nbsp;assigning an internal case or control number for each appealed claim and claim file. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>PROHIBITED LANGUAGE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claims procedures language may NOT contain any provision or be administered in any way that "unduly inhibits or hampers the initiation or processing of claims for
benefits." For example, the Plan cannot require a payment of a fee or impose a cost as a condition for processing claims or appeals. Additionally, if a plan makes arbitration a part of its claims
procedures, the claimant cannot be required to share in the cost of the arbitration. Also, benefit denial for failure to obtain prior approval before incurring cost to the plan cannot be enforced
where obtaining prior approval is impossible or if the process of obtaining prior approval could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the claimant (e.g.,&nbsp;claimant is unconscious and needs
immediate care). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant has the right to go immediately to court and file suit under &sect;&nbsp;502(a) of ERISA, without exhausting administrative procedures as is
typically required, if the claims procedures of this Plan are inadequate. "Substantial compliance" of claims procedures is NOT acceptable. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the claims procedures are deemed adequate, the covered person must exhaust all of the claims appeal procedures before filing a lawsuit for benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claimant shall have six (6)&nbsp;months after the final benefit determination of an appeal is made by the Plan in order to file&nbsp;a lawsuit in court.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the employer's obligation to pay claims otherwise allowable under the terms of the Plan shall be limited to its
obligation to make contributions to the Plan as set forth in the preceding paragraph entitled "Contributions To The Plan." Payment of said claims in accordance with these procedures shall discharge
completely the employer's obligation with respect to such payments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that the employer terminates the Plan, then as of the effective date of termination, the employer (and covered employee and dependents and COBRA participants) shall have no
further obligation to make additional contributions to the Plan. In addition, coverage for allowable claims filed
after such Plan termination date shall be limited to those remaining assets of the fund (if any) not required to pay claims filed before the effective Plan termination date. If the fund's assets are
not sufficient to fund the benefits otherwise payable under this Plan, then such benefits shall not be payable under this Plan and neither the Plan Sponsor, named fiduciary, Plan Administrator, or
trustee shall be liable for such benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>THE TRUST AGREEMENT  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this Plan is established under a trust agreement, that agreement is made a part of the Plan. A copy of the appropriate agreement is available for examination

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>PLAN AMENDMENTS/MODIFICATION/TERMINATION  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Plan is terminated, the rights of the covered persons are limited to expenses incurred before termination. All previous contributions by the employer shall
continue to be issued for the purpose of paying benefits under the provisions of this Plan with respect to claims arising before such termination, or shall be used for the purpose of providing similar
health benefits to covered persons, until all contributions are exhausted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
employer intends to maintain this Plan indefinitely; however, it reserves the right, at any time, to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part. This includes amending
the benefits under the Plan or the trust agreement (if any). The authority to make any such amendments to the Plan is that of the Plan Administrator or to whom the Plan Administrator delegates
authority. Any such amendment, modification, revocation or termination of the Plan shall be authorized and signed by the Plan Administrator or his/her delegate of the employer. Written evidence of
such delegation of authority shall be provided to the Claims Administrator. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan Administrator shall notify all covered persons of any amendment modifying the substantive terms of the Plan as soon as administratively feasible after its adoption, but in no
event later than 120&nbsp;days of such decision. If there is a material reduction in covered services or benefits, the Plan must give covered persons and beneficiaries a summary of the change within
sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the effective date of the change. As an alternative, the Plan can meet this requirement if it gives a summary of benefits every 90&nbsp;days. Such notification shall be
in the form of a Summary of Material Modifications (within the meaning of ERISA section&nbsp;102(a) (1)&nbsp;and Labor Reg. Section&nbsp;2520.104 b 3)&nbsp;unless incorporated in an updated
Summary Plan Description (as described in ERISA Section&nbsp;102(b)). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>PLAN IS NOT AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan Document and Summary Plan Description constitute the primary authority for administration of the Plan. The establishment, administration and maintenance
of this Plan will not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment, give any employee of the employer the right to be retained in the service of the employer, or to interfere with the right of the
employer to discharge or otherwise terminate the employment of any employee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>CONSISTENCY WITH POLICIES OF INSURANCE AND CONTRACTS FOR MEDICAL REVIEW SERVICES  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan is intended to be consistent with any contracts for policies of insurance under which the employer makes contributions, and with any contracts for
medical review services. To the extent the terms of this Plan are inconsistent with such contracts, the terms of such contracts shall prevail. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>CLERICAL ERROR  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any clerical error by the Plan Administrator or an agent of the Plan Administrator in keeping pertinent records or a delay in making any changes will not
invalidate coverage otherwise validly in force or
continue coverage validly terminated. An equitable adjustment of contributions will be made when the error or delay is discovered. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If,
due to a clerical error, an overpayment occurs in a Plan reimbursement amount, the Plan retains a contractual right to the overpayment. The person or institution receiving the
overpayment will be required to return the incorrect amount of money. In the case of a covered person, if it is requested, the amount of overpayment will be deducted from future benefits payable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>HEALTH STATEMENTS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of fraud or material misrepresentation, all statements, including oral statements, made to or by a covered person or provider regarding coverages,
eligibility and or benefits under the Plan will be deemed representations and not warranties. No such representation will void or alter the Plan benefits, except in the case of fraud or material

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section titles are for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in interpreting this Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
failure to enforce any provision of this Plan shall affect the right thereafter to enforce such provision, nor shall such failure affect its right to enforce any other provision of
the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>RIGHT TO OFF-SET  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan has a right of off-set to satisfy reimbursement claims against covered persons for money received by the covered person from a third party,
including any insurer. If the covered person fails or refuses to reimburse the Plan for funds paid for any claims, the Plan may deny payment of any future claims of the covered person, up to the full
amount paid by the Plan and subject to reimbursement for such claims. This right of off-set applies to all reimbursement claims owing to the Plan whether or not formal demand is made by
the Plan, and notwithstanding any anti-subrogation, "common fund," made whole" or similar statutes, regulations, or common law theories. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating
pharmacies have contracted with Express Scripts, the administrator of the Prescription Drug Plan to charge Plan covered persons reduced fees for covered prescription drugs.
Express Scripts is the administrator of the Prescription Drug Plan. The telephone number for Express Scripts is (888)-201-5863. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Prescription Drug Plan does not have a deductible. The copayment is applied to each covered pharmacy drug charge. The copayment is not a covered expense under the Medical Plan. Any
one prescription is limited to a ninety (90)-day supply per prescription or refill. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a drug is purchased from a non-participating provider, or not through Express Scripts, the covered person will pay for his/her prescription in full, and submit the paid
receipt, with a claim form, to Mountain States Administration for reimbursement. Reimbursement will be subject to the deductible and coinsurance provisions as described in the Medical portion of the
Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>MAIL ORDER BENEFIT OPTION  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mail order option is also available. If you wish to order by mail, you need to obtain an order form from the Benefits Department, complete it, and mail the form
together with the physician's original (not copy) prescription and credit card information for payment of your coinsurance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Your ERISA Rights:  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a participant in this Plan, you are entitled to certain rights under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all
persons eligible to participate in the Plan shall be entitled to: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Examine,
without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, such as worksites and union halls, all documents governing the Plan, including insurance contracts and
collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form&nbsp;5500) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the
Employee Benefits Security Administration. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Obtain,
upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the
latest annual report (Form&nbsp;5500) and updated Summary Plan Description. The administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>Receive
a summary of the Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this Summary Annual Report. </FONT></P>

health care coverage for yourself, your spouse, or dependents if there is a loss of coverage under the Plan as a result of a qualifying event. You or your dependents may have to pay for such
coverage. Review this Summary Plan Description and the documents governing the Plan on the rules governing your COBRA continuation coverage rights. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>Reduction
or elimination of exclusionary periods of coverage for pre-existing conditions under your group health plan, if you have creditable coverage from another plan. You should be
provided a certificate of creditable coverage, free of charge, from your group health coverage issuer when you lose coverage under the Plan, when you become entitled to elect COBRA continuation
coverage, when your COBRA continuation coverage ceases, if you request it before losing coverage, or if you request it up to twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months after losing coverage. Without
evidence of creditable coverage, you may be subject to a pre-existing condition exclusion for twelve (12)&nbsp;months (or eighteen (18)&nbsp;months for late enrollees) after your
enrollment date in your coverage. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your
Plan, called "fiduciaries" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your Employer, your union, or any
other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. If your claim for a welfare benefit
is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation for the denial, including copies of documents relating to the decision, without charge. You have the right to appeal
any denial and to have the Plan review and reconsider your claim all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request
materials from the Plan and do not receive them within thirty (30)&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the
materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits
which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the Plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of
a medical child support order, you may file suit in Federal court. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you
may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may
order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need
assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your
telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. </FONT></P>
