In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree

Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure

deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Co-Administrative Agent and at the Borrower&#146;s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear
interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.
Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Co-Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing
Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied,
shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC
Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the
consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be

Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the
Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the
Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.09(b),
such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower as and to
the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the Borrower would remain in compliance with
Section&nbsp;2.09(b) and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

in the case of Prospective Lenders already parties hereunder, on the date specified in the notice
delivered pursuant to this Section and (B)&nbsp;in the case of Prospective Lenders not already parties
hereunder, on the effective date of the Accession Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of any
Accession Agreement to which any Prospective Lender is a party, (i)&nbsp;such Prospective Lender shall
thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits
and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder and

Prospective Lender as provided in such Accession Agreement. Upon the effectiveness of any increase
pursuant to this Section in the Commitment of a Lender already a party hereunder, Schedule&nbsp;2.01
shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the increased Commitment of such Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the aggregate Commitments (or in the Commitment of
any Lender) shall become effective under this Section unless, on the date of such increase, (i)&nbsp;the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)&nbsp;and (b)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;4.02 shall be satisfied (with all

the Borrower is in Pro Forma Compliance, after giving effect to any such increase and other

shall have received a certificate dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the
Borrower that the conditions in the foregoing clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;have been satisfied as of such

pursuant to this paragraph, any Loans outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such increase or
extension shall continue outstanding until the ends of the respective Interest Periods applicable
thereto, and shall then be repaid or refinanced with new Loans made pursuant to Sections&nbsp;2.01 and
2.02; <U>provided</U> that upon the occurrence of any Default, each Prospective Lender shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent
