coking operation after charging a coking oven with coal. The method includes providing a duct system between a first coke oven having a first coking chamber and a second coke oven having a second coking chamber to direct at least a portion of gas
from a gas space in first coking chamber to the second coke oven thereby reducing a gas flow rate in the first sole flue gas system of the first coke oven. Reduction in sole flue gas flow rates has a beneficial effect on product throughput, the life
of the coke oven and environmental control of volatile emissions from coke ovens.</FONT></P></TD></TR>
