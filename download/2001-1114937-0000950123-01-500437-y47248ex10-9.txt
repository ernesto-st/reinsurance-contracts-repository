2.      THE FACILITY

2.1     GRANT OF THE FACILITY

        The Banks grant to the Borrower, upon the terms and subject to the
        conditions hereof, a sterling multiple draw loan facility in an
        aggregate amount of L1,300,000,000, as the same may be reduced in
        accordance with the terms hereof.

2.2     PURPOSE

        The Facility is intended to fund loans by the Borrower to other members
        of the UK Group each of which shall utilize the proceeds thereof to
        finance the working capital


                                       34
<PAGE>   36
        requirements of the UK Group, provided that in no event shall the
        proceeds of any Advance be used for a purpose other than to finance the
        construction, capital expenditure and working capital needs of a Cable
        Business.

2.3     APPLICATION

        The Borrower shall apply all amounts raised by it hereunder in or
        towards satisfaction of, the purposes specified in Clause 2.2 (Purpose)
        and none of the Finance Parties shall be obliged to concern themselves
        with such application.

2.4     CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

        Save as the Banks may otherwise agree, the Borrower may not deliver any
        Notice of Drawdown unless the Agent has confirmed to the Borrower and
        the Banks that it has received all of the documents and other evidence
        listed in Schedule 3 (Conditions Precedent) and that each is, in form
        and substance, satisfactory to the Agent. The Agent shall notify the
        Borrower and the Banks promptly upon being so satisfied.

2.5     BANKS' OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL

        The obligations of each Bank are several and the failure by a Bank to
        perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the obligations of an
        Obligor towards any other party hereto nor shall any other party be
        liable for the failure by such Bank to perform its obligations
        hereunder.

2.6     BANKS' RIGHTS SEVERAL

        The rights of each Bank are several and any debt arising hereunder at
        any time from an Obligor to any of the other parties hereto shall be a
        separate and independent debt. Each such party shall be entitled to
        protect and enforce its individual rights arising out of this Agreement
        independently of any other party (so that it shall not be necessary for
        any party hereto to be joined as an additional party in any proceedings
        for this purpose).

3.      UTILISATION OF THE FACILITY

3.1     DRAWDOWN CONDITIONS FOR ADVANCES

        An Advance will be made by the Banks to the Borrower if:

        3.1.1   during the Notice Period, the Agent has received a completed
                Notice of Drawdown from the Borrower;

        3.1.2   the proposed date for the making of such Advance is a Business
                Day falling one month or more before the Final Maturity Date;

        3.1.3   the proposed amount of such Advance is (a) if less than the
                Available Facility an amount or integral multiple of L50,000,000
                or (b) equal to the amount of the Available Facility;

        3.1.4   there would not, immediately after the making of such an
                Advance, be more than five Advances outstanding;

        3.1.5   neither of the events mentioned in sub-clauses 5.1.1 and 5.1.2
                of Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption and Alternative Interest Rates)
                shall have occurred;


                                       35
<PAGE>   37
        3.1.6   to the extent that the initial aggregate principal amount of
                Advances made under this Facility would exceed L300,000,000
                after giving effect to the making of such Advance, the Pushdown
                Condition has been satisfied;

        3.1.7   on and as of the proposed date for the making of such Advance
                (i) no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default is
                continuing and (ii) the Repeated Representations are true in all
                material respects;

        3.1.8   the cash on hand of the UK Group at the close of business on the
                Business Day immediately preceding the date the Notice of
                Drawdown for such Advance is delivered to the Agent shall not
                exceed L25,000,000; and

        3.1.9   in the case of Advances made on or after the Pushdown Date, the
                advances which are outstanding under the Senior Bank Credit
                Agreement shall equal at least L2,500,000,000 less any permanent
                reductions to the availability thereunder made after the
                Execution Date.

3.2     EACH BANK'S PARTICIPATION IN ADVANCES

        Each Bank will participate through its Facility Office in each Advance
        made pursuant to this Clause 3 (Utilisation of the Facility) in the
        proportion borne by its Available Commitment to the Available Facility
        immediately prior to the making of that Advance.

3.3     REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE COMMITMENT

        If a Bank's Commitment is reduced in accordance with the terms hereof
        after the Agent has received the Notice of Drawdown for an Advance and
        such reduction was not taken into account in the Available Facility,
        then the amount of that Advance shall be reduced accordingly.

3.4     FORCED DRAWDOWN

        At any time during the continuance of a Remedy Restriction Period, the
        Agent, acting upon the instructions of an Instructing Group, shall have
        the right to require the Borrower to incur an Advance in the amount
        necessary to cause the Full Funding Date to occur (such amount the
        "FORCED DRAWDOWN Amount"). Such right shall be exercised by the giving
        of notice of such drawdown by the Agent to the Banks and the Borrower.

        In such an event, upon notice to each Bank, such Bank shall fund its pro
        rata portion of the Forced Drawdown Amount to the Agent and the Agent,
        on behalf of the Borrower, will transfer the amounts so made available
        to the Borrower's account at the Senior Agent. The Borrower and each of
        the other Obligors acknowledge and agree that the making of an Advance
        by the Banks pursuant to this Clause 3.4 (Forced Drawdown) has been
        irrevocably and unconditionally consented to by the Borrower and the
        Obligors and neither the Borrower nor any other Obligor nor any other
        person shall have the right to revoke, cancel or otherwise limit such
        consent or the right of the Banks to make such Advance hereunder.

4.      PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON ADVANCES; INTEREST PERIODS

4.1     PAYMENT OF INTEREST

        On the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period of
        such Advance exceeds six months, on the expiry of each period of six
        months during such Interest Period) the Borrower shall pay accrued
        interest on the Advance to which such Interest Period relates.

4.2     CALCULATION OF INTEREST

        The rate of interest applicable to an Advance from time to time during
        an Interest Period relating thereto shall be the rate per annum which is
        the lesser of:

        4.2.1   16 per cent. per annum; and

        4.2.2   the sum of:

                (a)     the Margin at such time;

                (b)     the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

                (c)     LIBOR on the Quotation Date therefor.

4.3     LIMITATIONS ON CASH INTEREST.

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, to
        the extent that the rate of interest applicable to an Advance on any
        interest payment date for such Advance exceeds the sum of 14 per cent.
        per annum and the increase, if any, in the rate of interest pursuant to
        Clause 4.4 (Default Interest) such excess interest shall be paid by
        adding such excess interest to the principal amount of such Advance
        unless the Borrower shall have given the Agent notice at least three
        Business Days prior to such interest payment date that it shall pay such
        excess amount in cash.

4.4     DEFAULT INTEREST

        The interest rate determined in accordance with Clause 4.2 (Calculation
        of Interest) shall be increased by one per cent. per annum (it being
        understood that the interest rate could by reason of such increase
        exceed 16 per cent. per annum) from the date determined by the Agent
        (acting reasonably) (in writing) as being the date on which an Event of
        Default or Potential Event of Default has occurred or come into
        existence until the date specified by the Agent (in writing) as being
        the date on which it has been demonstrated to its satisfaction (acting
        reasonably) that such Event of Default or Potential Event of Default is
        no longer continuing. The Agent shall promptly notify the other parties
        hereto of any determination that an Event of Default or Potential Event
        of Default has occurred or exists or, as the case may be, that it has
        been demonstrated to its reasonable satisfaction that such is no longer
        continuing.

4.5     INTEREST PERIODS

        The period for which an Advance is outstanding shall be divided into
        successive periods each of which (other than the first, which shall
        begin on the day such Advance is made) shall start on the last day of
        the preceding such period.

4.6     DURATION


                                       37
<PAGE>   39
        The duration of each Interest Period shall, save as otherwise provided
        herein, be one, two, three or six months or such other period as the
        Agent (acting on instructions of all the Banks) may agree in each case
        as the Borrower may by not less than five Business Days' prior notice to
        the Agent select, PROVIDED THAT:

        4.6.1   if the Borrower fails to give such notice of its selection in
                relation to an Interest Period, the duration of that Interest
                Period shall, subject to sub-clauses 4.6.2, 4.6.3 and 4.6.4 be
                one month;

        4.6.2   if there are more than five Advances outstanding any Interest
                Period which begins during or at the same time as anyone or more
                other Interest Periods shall end at the same time as such one of
                those other Interest Periods as the Borrower may, by not less
                than five Business Days' prior notice to the Agent, select or,
                failing such selection, the first such other Interest Period to
                expire;

        4.6.3   any Interest Period which would otherwise end during the month
                preceding, or extend beyond, the Final Maturity Date shall be of
                such duration that it shall end on the Final Maturity Date; and

        4.6.4   prior to the Syndication Date, Interest Periods shall be one
                month or such other period as the Agent and the Borrower may
                agree.

4.7     CONSOLIDATION OF ADVANCES

        If two or more Interest Periods end at the same time, then, on the last
        day of those Interest Periods, the Advances to which they relate shall
        be consolidated into and treated as a single Advance.

4.8     DIVISION OF ADVANCES

        The Borrower may, by not less than five Business Days' prior notice to
        the Agent, direct that any Advance shall, at the beginning of any
        Interest Period relating thereto, be divided into (and thereafter, save
        as otherwise provided herein, treated in all respects as) two or more
        Advances in such amounts (in aggregate, equaling the amount of the
        Advance being so divided) as shall be specified by the Borrower in such
        notice, PROVIDED THAT the Borrower shall not be entitled to make such a
        direction if:

        4.8.1   as a result of so doing, there would be more than five
                outstanding Advances; or

        4.8.2   any Advance thereby coming into existence would be of an amount
                less than L50,000,000.

5.      MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

5.1     MARKET DISRUPTION

        If, in relation to any Advance:

        5.1.1   LIBOR is to be determined by reference to Reference Banks and at
                or about 11.00 a.m. on the Quotation Date for the relevant
                Interest Period none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies
                a rate for the purpose of determining LIBOR for the relevant
                Interest Period; or


                                       38
<PAGE>   40
        5.1.2   before the close of business in London on the Quotation Date for
                such Advance the Agent has been notified by a Bank or each of a
                group of Banks, to whom in aggregate fifty per cent. or more of
                such Advance would be owed if made that the LIBOR rate does not
                accurately reflect the cost of funding its participation in such
                Advance,

        then the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks of such event
        and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Clause
        5.2 (Substitute Interest Period and Interest Rate) shall apply to such
        Advance (if it is a Rollover Advance). If either sub-clause 5.1.1 or
        5.1.2 of Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption and Alternative Interest Rates)
        applies to a proposed Advance (other than a Rollover Advance), such an
        Advance shall not be made.

5.2     SUBSTITUTE INTEREST PERIOD AND INTEREST RATE

        If sub-clause 5.1.1 of Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption and Alternative
        Interest Rates) applies to an Advance, the duration of the relevant
        Interest Period shall be one month or, if less, such that it shall end
        on the Final Maturity Date. If either sub-clause 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 of
        Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption and Alternative Interest Rates) applies to
        an Advance, the rate of interest applicable to each Bank's portion of
        such Advance during the relevant Interest Period shall (subject to any
        agreement reached pursuant to Clause 5.3 (Alternative Rate)) be the rate
        per annum which is the sum of:

        5.2.1   the Margin at such time;

        5.2.2   the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

        5.2.3   the rate per annum notified to the Agent by such Bank before the
                last day of such Interest Period to be that which expresses as a
                percentage rate per annum the cost to such Bank of funding from
                whatever sources it may reasonably select its portion of such
                Advance during such Interest Period.

5.3     ALTERNATIVE RATE

        If either of those events mentioned in sub-clauses 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 of
        Clause 5.1 (Market Disruption and Alternative Interest Rates) occurs in
        relation to an Advance, then if the Agent or the Borrower so requires,
        the Agent and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations with a view to
        agreeing a substitute basis (i) for determining the rates of interest
        from time to time applicable to the Advances and/or (ii) upon which the
        Advances may be maintained (whether in sterling or some other currency)
        thereafter and any such substitute basis that is agreed shall take
        effect in accordance with its terms and be binding on each party hereto,
        PROVIDED THAT the Agent may not agree any such substitute basis without
        the prior consent of each Bank (which is not to be unreasonably
        withheld).

6.      NOTIFICATION

6.1     ADVANCES

        The Agent shall, promptly upon its receipt of a Notice of Drawdown,
        notify each Bank of:

        6.1.1   the proposed amount of the relevant Advance;


                                       39
<PAGE>   41
        6.1.2   the proposed length of the relevant Interest Period; and

        6.1.3   the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Advance allocated
                to such Bank pursuant to Clause 3.2 (Each Bank's Participation
                in Advances).

6.2     INTEREST PERIODS

        Not less than three Business Days before the first day of an Interest
        Period, the Agent shall notify each Bank of the proposed amount of the
        relevant Advance, the proposed length of such Interest Period and the
        aggregate principal amount of the relevant Advance allocated to such
        Bank pursuant to Clause 3.2 (Each Bank's Participation in Advances).

6.3     INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION

        The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of each
        determination of LIBOR, the Mandatory Cost Rate and the Margin.

6.4     CHANGES TO ADVANCES OR INTEREST RATES

        The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of any change
        to (a) the proposed length of an Interest Period or (b) any interest
        rate occasioned by the operation of Clause 5 (Market Disruption and
        Alternative Interest Rates).

7.      REPAYMENT AND REDUCTION OF THE FACILITY

7.1     REPAYMENT

        The Borrower shall repay each Advance made to it in full on the Final
        Maturity Date.

8.      CANCELLATION AND PREPAYMENT

8.1     CANCELLATION OF THE FACILITY

        Subject to the provisions of Clause 8.7 (Limitations on Cancellation of
        the Facility), the Borrower may, by giving to the Agent not less than
        five Business Days' prior written notice to that effect, cancel the
        whole or any part (being a minimum amount of L50,000,000 and an integral
        multiple of L10,000,000) of the Available Facility. Any such
        cancellation shall reduce the Available Commitment and Commitment of

        8.4.1   any sum payable to any Bank by an Obligor is required to be
                increased pursuant to Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up); or

        such a payment subject to the deduction or withholding of tax, in which
        case the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of which such deduction
        or withholding is required to be made) shall, subject to Clause 10.6
        (Excluded Claims), be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that
        such Finance Party receives a sum net of any deduction or withholding

                including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be received or
                receivable by the Agent or such Bank but not actually
                receivable) by the jurisdiction in which the Agent or such Bank
                is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or
                jurisdictions) in which the Agent or such Bank is treated as
                resident for tax purposes (but excluding any such tax that would
                not have arisen but for such Agent or Bank, as the case may be,
                being treated as a resident in a jurisdiction solely by reason
                of having entered into this Agreement, performed its obligations
                or received any payment hereunder or enforced its rights
                hereunder); or

        10.2.2  any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net
                income, profits or gains of the Facility Office of the Agent or
                such Bank actually received or receivable by the Agent or such
                Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any sum
                deemed for purposes of tax to be received or receivable by the
                Agent or such Bank but not actually receivable) by the
                jurisdiction in which its Facility Office is located; or

<PAGE>   48
        10.2.3  any tax imposed on the Agent, as a result of the failure by a
                Bank to satisfy on the due date of a payment of interest either
                of the conditions set out in sub-clauses 10.3.1 and 10.3.2 of
                Clause 10.3 (Banks' Tax Status Confirmation); or

        10.2.4  for the avoidance of doubt, any tax imposed on a Bank which
                would not have arisen but for the sub-participation of its
                rights and benefits under any of the Finance Documents.

10.3    BANKS' TAX STATUS CONFIRMATION

        Each Bank confirms in favour of the Agent (on the date hereof or, in the
        case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to a transfer or
        assignment, on the date on which the relevant transfer or assignment
        becomes effective) that either:

        10.3.1  it is not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom and is
                beneficially entitled to its share of the Loan and the interest
                thereon; or

        10.3.2  it is a bank as defined for the purposes of Section 349 of ICTA
                and is beneficially entitled to its share of the Loan and the
                interest thereon,

        and each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent if there is any change in
        its position from that set out above.

10.4    U.S. TAX FORMS

        Each Bank that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in
        Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal
        income tax purposes agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on
        or prior to the Initial Advance Date, or in the case of a Bank that is
        an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant
        to Clause 30.3 (Assignment and Transfers by Banks) (unless the
        respective Bank was already a Bank hereunder immediately prior to such
        assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to
        such Bank, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of
        Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a
        complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or successor forms)
        certifying to such Bank's entitlement as of such date to a complete
        exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to
        be made under this Agreement, or (ii) if the Bank is not a "bank" within
        the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver
        either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect
        to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) pursuant to clause
        (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 8
        (any such certificate, a "NON-BANK CERTIFICATE") and (y) two accurate
        and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
        W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) (or successor
        form) certifying to such Bank's entitlement to a complete exemption from
        United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be
        made under this Agreement. In addition, each Bank agrees that from time
        to time after the Initial Advance Date, upon the reasonable request of
        the Borrower or when a change in circumstances of the Bank renders the
        previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect,
        it will deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two new accurate and
        complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service W-8ECI or
        Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any income tax treaty), or
        Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a
        Non-Bank Certificate, as


                                       47
<PAGE>   49
        the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in order to
        confirm or establish the entitlement as of such date of such Bank to a
        continued exemption from or (as a result of a change in law, treaty,
        rule, regulations, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof)
        reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments
        under this Agreement, or it shall notify the Borrower and the Agent of
        its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case
        such Bank shall not be required to deliver any such Form or Certificate
        pursuant to this Clause 10.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
        contained in Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up), but subject to Clause 10.5
        (Claims by Banks and the Agent) and the immediately succeeding sentence,
        (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do
        so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the
        United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof
        or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for
        the account of any Bank which is not a United States person (as such
        term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal
        income tax purposes to the extent that such Bank has not provided to the
        Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete
        exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall
        not be obligated pursuant to Clause 10.1 to gross-up payments to be made
        to a Bank in respect of income or similar taxes imposed by the United
        States if (I) such Bank has not provided to the Borrower the Internal
        Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Borrower pursuant
        to this Clause 10.4 or (II) in the case of a payment, other than
        interest that is treated as interest for U.S. federal income tax
        purposes, to a Bank described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that
        such Forms do not establish a complete exemption from withholding of
        such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
        preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Clause 10.4 and except as set
        forth in Clause 10.5 (Claims by Banks and the Agent), the Borrower
        agrees to pay any additional amounts and to indemnify each Bank in the
        manner set forth in Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up) in respect of any United
        States taxes deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately
        preceding sentence as a result of any changes that are effective after
        the Initial Advance Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental
        rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof,
        relating to the deducting or withholding of such taxes.

10.5    CLAIMS BY BANKS AND THE AGENT

        A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity)
        shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to the claim, whereupon
        the Agent shall notify the Borrower thereof. If the Agent intends to
        make a claim pursuant to Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity) it shall notify the
        Borrower of the event giving rise to the claim.

10.6    EXCLUDED CLAIMS

        If any Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender, no
        Obligor shall be liable to pay to that Finance Party under Clause 10.1
        (Tax Gross-Up) any amount in respect of taxes levied or imposed by the
        United Kingdom in excess of the amount it would have been obliged to pay
        if that Finance Party had been or had not ceased to be a Qualifying
        Lender PROVIDED THAT this Clause 10.6 shall not apply (and each Obligor
        shall be obliged to comply with its obligations under Clause 10.1 (Tax
        Gross-Up)) if:

        10.6.1  after the date hereof, there shall have been any introduction
                of, or change in or in the interpretation, administration or
                application of, any law or regulation or order or governmental
                rule or double taxation agreement or any published


                                       48
<PAGE>   50
                practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority and as a
                result thereof such Finance Party ceases to be a Qualifying
                Lender; or

        10.6.2    such Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender
                  as a result of the actions of any Obligor.

10.7    TREATY LENDERS

        A Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that
        Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural
        formalities necessary for that Obligor to obtain authorisation to make
        that payment without a deduction or withholding for or on account of tax
        imposed by the United Kingdom. If an Obligor is able to demonstrate that
        a deduction or withholding for or on account of tax imposed by the
        United Kingdom is required to be made by it as a result of a Treaty
        Lender's failure to so co-operate, such an Obligor shall not be liable
        to pay any increased amount under Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-Up) as a result
        of such a deduction or withholding.

10.8    NOTIFICATION OF STATUS

        Each Bank shall notify the Agent if it is not a Qualifying Lender at the
        time it becomes a Bank hereunder and shall promptly notify the Agent if
        at any time thereafter it ceases to be a Qualifying Lender. The Agent
        shall promptly notify the Borrower of any notices it receives under this
        Clause 10.8 and if it ceases to be a Qualifying Lender.

11.     TAX RECEIPTS

11.1    NOTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT TO DEDUCT TAX

        If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction or
        withholding from any sum payable by it under the Finance Documents (or
        if thereafter there is any change in the rates at which or the manner in
        which such deductions or withholdings are calculated), such Obligor and
        the Bank to which such sum is payable shall promptly upon becoming aware
        of such a requirement notify the Agent accordingly. If the Agent
        receives such a notification from a Bank it shall promptly notify the
        Borrower and the Obligor who is required to make such a deduction or
        withholding.

11.2    EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT OF TAX

        If an Obligor makes any payment under the Finance Documents in respect
        of which it is required to make any deduction or withholding, it shall
        pay the full amount required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant
        taxation or other authority within the time allowed for such payment
        under applicable law and shall request and, within thirty days of it
        receiving the same, deliver to the Agent for each Bank an original
        receipt (or a certified copy thereof) issued by such authority
        evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so required to
        be deducted or withheld in respect of that Bank's share of such payment.

11.3    TAX CREDIT PAYMENT

        If an additional payment is made under Clause 10 (Taxes) by an Obligor
        or the Borrower for the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance
        Party, in its sole discretion, determines that it has obtained (and has
        derived full use and benefit from) a credit against, a relief or
        remission for, or repayment of, any tax, then, if and to the extent that
        such Finance Party, in its sole opinion, determines that such credit,
        relief, remission or repayment is in respect of or calculated with
        reference to or otherwise relates to the


                                       49
<PAGE>   51
        additional payment made pursuant to Clause 10 (Taxes), such Finance
        Party shall, to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to the
        retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment,
        pay to such Obligor or, as the case may be, the Borrower such amount as
        such Finance Party shall, in its sole opinion, determine to be the
        amount which will leave such Finance Party (after such payment) in no
        worse after-tax position than it would have been in had the additional
        payment in question not been required to be made by such Obligor or the
        Borrower.

11.4    TAX CREDIT CLAWBACK

        If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor or the Borrower
        pursuant to Clause 11.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and such Finance Party
        subsequently determines, in its sole opinion, that the credit, relief,
        remission or repayment in respect of which such payment was made was not
        available or has been withdrawn or that it was unable to use such
        credit, relief, remission or repayment in full, such Obligor or the
        Borrower shall reimburse such Finance Party such amount as such Finance
        Party determines, in its sole opinion, is necessary to place it in the
        same after-tax position as it would have been in if such credit, relief,
        remission or repayment had been obtained and fully used and retained by
        such Finance Party.

11.5    TAX AND OTHER AFFAIRS

        Subject to Clause 10.7, no provision of this Agreement shall interfere
        with the right of any Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other
        affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to
        claim any credit, relief, remission or repayment in respect of any
        payment under Clause 10 (Taxes) in priority to any other credit, relief,
        remission or repayment available to it nor oblige any Finance Party to
        disclose any information relating to its tax or other affairs or any
        computations in respect thereof.

12.     INCREASED COSTS

12.1    INCREASED COSTS

        If, by reason of the occurrence, in each case after the date hereof, of
        (a) any change in law or in its interpretation or administration and/or
        (b) compliance with any such new law or with any request or requirement
        relating to the maintenance of capital or any other request from or
        requirement of any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other
        authority (in each case, where a request or requirement that does not
        have the force of law is a request or requirement with which financial
        institutions subject to such request or requirement are generally
        accustomed to comply):

        12.1.1  a Bank or any holding company of such Bank is unable to obtain
                the rate of return on its capital which it would have been able
                to obtain but for such Bank's entering into or assuming or
                maintaining a commitment or performing its obligations under the
                Finance Documents;

        12.1.2  a Bank or any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost as a
                result of such Bank's entering into or assuming or maintaining a
                commitment or performing its obligations under the Finance
                Documents; or

        12.1.3  there is any increase in the cost to a Bank or any holding
                company of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's share
                of the Advances or any Unpaid Sum,


                                       50
<PAGE>   52
        then the Borrower shall, within three Business Days of a demand of the
        Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of that Bank amounts sufficient
        to indemnify that Bank or to enable that Bank to indemnify its holding
        company from and against, as the case may be, (i) such reduction in the
        rate of return of capital, (ii) such cost or (iii) such increased cost.

12.2    INCREASED COSTS CLAIMS

        A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 12.1 (Increased
        Costs) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to such claim,
        whereupon the Agent shall notify the Borrower thereof.

12.3    EXCLUSIONS

        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 12 (Increased
        Costs), no Bank shall be entitled to make any claim under this Clause 12
        (Increased Costs) in respect of any reduction in the rate of return on
        capital, cost or increased cost:

        12.3.1  attributable to a deduction or withholding for or on account of
                tax from a payment under a Finance Document required by law to
                be made by an Obligor and compensated for pursuant to the
                provisions of Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-Up) (or would have been
                compensated for under Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-Up) but was not so
                compensated solely because of Clause 10.4 (Tax Forms), Clause
                10.6 (Excluded Claims) or Clause 10.7 (Treaty Lenders));

        12.3.2  compensated by Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity) (or would have been
                compensated for under Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity) but was not so
                compensated solely because of one of the exclusions set out in
                sub-clauses 10.2.1 to 10.2.4 of Clause 10.2 (Tax Indemnity));

        12.3.3  compensated by the Mandatory Cost Rate; or

        12.3.4  attributable to the wilful breach by the relevant Finance Party
                or its affiliates of any law or regulation.

13.     ILLEGALITY

        If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make, fund
        or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its share of the Advances,
        then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming aware of the same, deliver
        to the Borrower through the Agent a notice to that effect and:

        13.1.1  such Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to participate in the
                making of any Advances and the amount of its Available
                Commitment (if any) shall be immediately reduced to zero; and

        13.1.2  if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, the Borrower
                shall no later than the last day permitted by law repay such
                Bank's share of any outstanding Advances together with accrued
                interest thereon and all other amounts owing to such Bank under
                the Finance Documents.


                                       51
<PAGE>   53
14.     MITIGATION

        If, in respect of any Bank, circumstances arise which would or would
        upon the giving of notice result in:

        14.1.1  an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account pursuant
                to Clause 10.1 (Tax Gross-up);

        14.1.2  a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 10.2 (Tax
                Indemnity) or Clause 12.1 (Increased Costs); or

        14.1.3  the reduction of its Available Commitment to zero or any
                repayment to be made pursuant to Clause 13 (Illegality),

        then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the
        rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors under any of the
        Clauses referred to above, such Bank shall promptly upon becoming aware
        of such circumstances notify the Agent thereof and, in consultation with
        the Agent and the Borrower and to the extent that it can do so lawfully,
        take reasonable steps (including a change of location of its Facility
        Office or the transfer of its rights, benefits and obligations under the
        Finance Documents to another financial institution acceptable to the
        Borrower and willing to participate in the Facility) to mitigate the
        effects of such circumstances, PROVIDED THAT such Bank shall be under no
        obligation to take any such action if, in the opinion of such Bank, to
        do so might have any adverse effect upon its business, operations or
        financial condition (other than any minor costs and expenses of an
        administrative nature).

15.     REPRESENTATIONS

        15.1.1  Each Covenant Group Obligor makes the representations and
                warranties set out in Clause 15.2 (Status and Due Authorisation)
                to Clause 15.29 (The Scheme); provided that insofar as the
                representations and warranties set out in sub-clause 15.15.3 of
                Clause 15.15 (Business Plan and Information Memorandum) and
                Clause 15.27 (Group Structure) relate to the Target Group, the
                Borrower makes such representations and warranties to the best
                of its knowledge and belief and without liability to pay damages
                for breach thereof.

        15.1.2  The Parent makes the representations and warranties set out in
                Clauses 15.2 (Status and Due Authorisation) to Clause 15.8 (No
                Winding-Up), Clause 15.21 (Execution of this Agreement) and
                Clause 15.26 (Security Interest) with respect to itself (as
                applicable).

        Each Obligor acknowledges that the Finance Parties have entered into the
        Finance Documents in reliance on those representations and warranties.

15.2    STATUS AND DUE AUTHORISATION

        It is duly organised under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
        established or incorporated with power to enter into each of the Finance
        Documents to which it is a party and to exercise its rights and perform
        its obligations thereunder and all corporate and other action required
        to authorise its execution of each of the Finance Documents to which it
        is a party and its performance of its obligations thereunder has been
        duly taken. No limit on its powers will be exceeded as a result of the
        borrowings, granting of


                                       52
<PAGE>   54
        security or giving of guarantees contemplated by the Finance Documents

                Document purports to create or, if that Security Document
                purports to evidence a security interest, accurately evidences a
                security interest which has been validly created and each
                security interest ranks in priority as specified in the Security
                Document creating or evidencing that interest.

        Agent) may reasonably require, PROVIDED THAT the Borrower shall not be
        under any obligation to supply any information the supply of which would
        be contrary to any confidentiality obligation binding on it and further
        provided that the Borrower shall incur no liability to pay damages for
        failure so to procure any member of the Target Group.

16.9    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        The Borrower shall ensure that each set of financial statements
        delivered pursuant to this Clause 16 is prepared using accounting
        policies, practices, procedures and reference period consistent with
        those applied in the preparation of the Original Financial Statements
        unless, in relation to any such set of financial statements, the
        Borrower notifies the Agent that there have been one or more changes in
        any such accounting policies, practices, procedures or reference period
        and:

        16.9.1    the auditors of the Borrower provide:

                  (a)   a description of the changes and the adjustments which
                        would be required to be made to those financial
                        statements in order to cause them to use the accounting
                        policies, practices, procedures and reference period
                        upon which the relevant Original Financial Statements
                        were prepared; and

                  (b)   sufficient information, in such detail and format as may
                        be reasonably required by the Agent, to enable the Banks
                        to make an accurate comparison between the financial
                        position indicated by those financial statements and the
                        relevant Original Financial Statements,

                  in which case any reference in this Agreement to those
                  financial statements shall be construed as a reference to
                  those financial statements as adjusted to reflect the basis
                  upon which the relevant Original Financial Statements were
                  prepared; or

        16.9.2    the Borrower also notifies the Agent that it is no longer
                  practicable to test compliance with the financial condition
                  set out in Clause 17.1 (UK Group Financial Condition) against
                  the financial statements received in which case:

                  (a)   the Agent and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations
                        with a view to agreeing alternative financial conditions
                        to replace those contained in


                                       61
<PAGE>   63
                        Clause 17.1 (UK Group Financial Condition) in order to
                        maintain a consistent basis for such financial
                        covenants; and

                  (b)   if, after three months commencing on the date of the
                        notice given to the Agent pursuant to this sub-clause
                        16.9.2, the Agent and the Borrower cannot agree
                        alternative financial conditions which are acceptable to
                        an Instructing Group, the Agent shall refer the matter
                        to such internationally recognised accounting firm as
                        may be agreed between the Borrower and an Instructing
                        Group for determination of the adjustments required to
                        be made to such financial statements or the calculation
                        of such ratios to take account of such change, such
                        determination to be binding on the parties hereto,
                        provided that pending such determination the Borrower
                        shall continue to prepare financial statements and
                        calculate such ratios in accordance with sub-clause
                        16.9.1 above.

                  Adverse Effect; provided that the Borrower shall incur no
                  liability to pay damages for failure to advise the Agent of

19.     EVENTS OF DEFAULT

        Each of Clause 19.1 (Failure to Pay) to Clause 19.16 (Material Adverse
        Change) describes circumstances which constitute an Event of Default for
        the purposes of this Agreement. Clause 19.17 (Acceleration and
        Cancellation) and Clause 19.18 (Advances Due on Demand) deal with the
        rights of the Agent and the Banks after the occurrence of an Event of
        Default.

        Any of the Obligors fails to pay any sum due from it under any of the
        Finance Documents to which it is a party at the time, in the currency
        and in the manner specified therein unless:

        19.1.1    the sum is of a principal amount which was not paid as a
                  result of a technical error or failure in the transmission of
                  funds and that payment is then received by the Agent within
                  one Business Day of the due date;

        19.1.2    the sum is of an amount of interest and that payment is then
                  received by the Agent within three Business Days of the due
                  date; or

        19.1.3    the sum is of an amount other than principal or interest and
                  that payment is then received by the Agent within five
                  Business Days of the due date.

19.2    MISREPRESENTATION

        Any representation or statement made or repeated by any Obligor in any
        of the Finance Documents or in any notice or other document or
        certificate delivered by it pursuant thereto or in connection therewith
        is or proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material
        respect when made or deemed to be made and the circumstances giving rise
        to such inaccuracy, if capable of remedy or change, are not remedied or
        do not change, such that the relevant representation or statement would
        be correct and not misleading if repeated five Business Days after the
        earlier of (a) it being notified by the Agent to the Group

        Any of the Obligors fails to comply with any of its obligations under
        Clause 16 (Financial Information) or Clause 18 (Covenants). No Event of
        Default under this Clause 19.3 shall occur in relation to:

                  Financial Information), Clause 16.10 (General Information) or
                  Clause 16.12 (Acquisition Information), if the failure to
                  comply with such is remedied within five Business Days of the
                  Agent giving notice thereof to the Group Representative; and

        19.3.2    Clause 18 (Covenants), if the failure to comply with such is
                  capable of remedy and is remedied within five Business Days of

                  comply PROVIDED THAT a breach of any of the obligations under
                  Clause 18.2 (Claims Pari Passu), Clause 18.3 (Maintenance

        20.7.1    to be indemnified by an Obligor; and/or

        20.7.2    to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any

                  and/or

        20.7.3    to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of

                  or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it
                  sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no
                  Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

        20.8.2    hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys

        21.2.2    The average daily utilisation of the Facility during a

                  Commitment Period.

        21.2.4    The average daily Available Commitments during a Commitment
                  Period shall equal the aggregate of the Available Commitments
                  on each day during such Commitment Period divided by the

23.1    DEFAULT INTEREST PERIODS

        If any sum due and payable by an Obligor hereunder is not paid on the
        due date therefor in accordance with Clause 26 (Payments) or if any sum
        due and payable by an Obligor under any judgment of any court in
        connection herewith is not paid on the date of such judgment, the period
        beginning on such due date or, as the case may be, the date of such
        judgment and ending on the date upon which the obligation of such
        Obligor to pay such sum is discharged shall be divided into successive
        periods, each of which (other than the first) shall start on the last
        day of the preceding such period and the duration of each of which shall
        (except as otherwise provided in this Clause 23 (Default Interest and
        Break Costs)) be selected by the Agent.

23.2    DEFAULT INTEREST

        An Unpaid Sum shall bear interest during each Interest Period in respect
        thereof at the rate per annum which is one per cent. per annum above the
        percentage rate which would apply if such Unpaid Sum had been an Advance
        in the amount and currency of such Unpaid Sum and for the same Interest
        Period, PROVIDED THAT if such Unpaid Sum relates to an Advance which
        became due and payable on a day other than the last day of an Interest
        Period relating thereto:

        23.2.1    the first Interest Period applicable to such Unpaid Sum shall
                  be of a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current
                  Interest Period relating to that Advance; and

        23.2.2    the percentage rate of interest applicable thereto from time
                  to time during such period shall be that which exceeds by one
                  per cent. the rate which would have been applicable to it had
                  it not so fallen due.

23.3    PAYMENT OF DEFAULT INTEREST

        Any interest which shall have accrued under Clause 23.2 (Default

                                       86
<PAGE>   88
        Unpaid Sum on the last day of its Interest Period in respect thereof or
        on such other dates as the Agent may specify by notice to such Obligor.

23.4    BREAK COSTS

        If any Bank or the Agent on its behalf receives or recovers all or any
        part of such Bank's share of an Advance or Unpaid Sum otherwise than on
        the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, the Borrower shall
        pay to the Agent on demand for account of such Bank an amount equal to
        the amount (if any) by which (a) the additional interest which would
        have been payable on the amount so received or recovered had it been
        received or recovered on the last day of that Interest Period exceeds
        (b) the amount of interest which in the opinion of the Agent would have
        been payable to the Agent on the last day of that Interest Period in
        respect of a deposit in the currency of the amount so received or
        recovered equal to the amount so received or recovered placed by it with
        a prime bank in London for a period starting on the Business Day
        following the date of such receipt or recovery and ending on the last
        day of that Interest Period.

                  thereon, which it may sustain or incur as a consequence of the
                  occurrence of any Event of Default or any default by any

                  to be assumed by it in the Finance Documents;

                  by reason of the operation of any one or more of the
                  provisions hereof.

24.2    CURRENCY INDEMNITY

        If any sum (a "SUM") due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents or

        24.2.1    making or filing a claim or proof against such Obligor;

        24.2.2    obtaining or enforcing an order or judgment in any court or

        the Borrower shall indemnify each person to whom such Sum is due from
        and against any loss suffered or incurred as a result of any discrepancy
        between (a) the rate of exchange used for such purpose to convert such
        Sum from the First Currency into the Second Currency and (b) the rate or
        rates of exchange available to such person at the time of receipt of
        such Sum.

                  (a)   in the case of a payment received for the account of the

                                 to the person from whom the amount was so
                                 received; and

                        (ii)     SECONDLY, in or towards payment on the same day
                                 to the account of the Borrower with such bank
                                 in London as the Borrower shall have previously
                                 notified to the Agent for this purpose; and

                  (b)   in the case of any other payment, be made available by
                        the Agent to the person entitled to receive such payment
                        in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a
                        Bank, for the account of its Facility Office) for value
                        the same day by transfer to such account of such person
                        with such bank in London as such person shall have
                        previously notified to the Agent.

        26.3.2    A payment will be deemed to have been made by the Agent on the
                  date on which it is required to be made under this Agreement
                  if the Agent has, on or before that date, taken steps to make
                  that payment in accordance with the

        any set-off or counterclaim.

26.5    CLAWBACK

        Where a sum is to be paid hereunder to the Agent for account of another
        person, the Agent shall not be obliged to make the same available to
        that other person until it has been able to establish to its
        satisfaction that it has actually received such sum, but if it does so
        and it proves to be the case that it had not actually received such sum,
        then the person to whom such sum was so made available shall on request
        refund the same to the Agent together with an amount sufficient to
        indemnify the Agent against any cost or loss it may have suffered or
        incurred by reason of its having paid out such sum prior to its having
        received such sum.

26.6    PARTIAL PAYMENTS

        under this Agreement in the following order:

        26.6.1    FIRST, in or towards payment of any unpaid costs and expenses
                  of the Agent;

26.7    VARIATION OF PARTIAL PAYMENTS

        The order of partial payments set out in Clause 26.6 (Partial Payments)
        shall override any appropriation made by the Obligor to which the

27.     SET-OFF

27.1    CONTRACTUAL SET-OFF

        Each Obligor authorises each Bank, at any time any sum is due and
        payable hereunder and remains unpaid, to apply any credit balance to
        which such Obligor is entitled on any account of such Obligor with such
        Bank in satisfaction of any sum due and payable from such Obligor to
        such Bank under the Finance Documents but unpaid. For this purpose, each
        Bank is authorised to purchase with the moneys standing to the credit of
        any such account such other currencies as may be necessary to effect
        such application.

27.2    SET-OFF NOT MANDATORY

        No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause

28.     SHARING

28.1    PAYMENTS TO BANKS

        If a Bank (a "RECOVERING BANK") applies any receipt or recovery from an
        Obligor to a payment due under this Agreement and such amount is
        received or recovered other than in accordance with Clause 26
        (Payments), then such Recovering Bank shall:

        28.1.1    notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery;

        28.1.2    at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an
                  amount (the "SHARING PAYMENT") equal to such receipt or
                  recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be
                  retained by such Recovering Bank as its share of any payment
                  to be made in accordance with Clause 26.6 (Partial Payments).

28.2    REDISTRIBUTION OF PAYMENTS

        The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the
        relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other
        than the Recovering Bank) in accordance with Clause 26.6 (Partial
        Payments).

28.3    RECOVERING BANK'S RIGHTS

        The Recovering Bank will be subrogated into the rights of the parties
        which have shared in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 28.2
        (Redistribution of Payments) in respect of the Sharing Payment (and the
        relevant Obligor shall be liable to the Recovering Bank in an amount
        equal to the Sharing Payment).

28.4    REPAYABLE RECOVERIES

        If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering
        Bank becomes repayable and is repaid by such Recovering Bank, then:

        28.4.1    each party which has received a share of such Sharing Payment
                  pursuant to Clause 28.2 (Redistribution of Payments) shall,
                  upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of
                  such Recovering Bank an amount equal to its share of such
                  Sharing Payment; and

        28.4.2    such Recovering Bank's rights of subrogation in respect of any
                  reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant Obligor will
                  be liable to the reimbursing party for the amount so
                  reimbursed.


                                       90
<PAGE>   92
28.5    EXCEPTION
        This Clause 28 (Sharing) shall not apply if the Recovering Bank would
        not, after making any payment pursuant hereto, have a valid and
        enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

28.6    RECOVERIES THROUGH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

        If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court it shall give
        prior notice to the Agent and the other Banks. If any Bank shall
        commence any action in any court to enforce its rights hereunder and, as
        a result thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount, then
        such Bank shall not be required to share any portion of such amount with
        any Bank which has the legal right to, but does not, join in such action
        or commence and diligently prosecute a separate action to enforce its
        rights in another court.

29.     THE AGENT, THE ARRANGERS AND THE BANKS

29.1    APPOINTMENT OF THE AGENT
        Each of the Arrangers and the Banks hereby appoints the Agent to act as
        its agent in connection herewith and authorises the Agent to exercise
        such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are specifically

29.2    AGENT'S DISCRETIONS

        The Agent may:

        29.2.1    assume, unless it has, in its capacity as agent for the Banks,
                  received notice to the contrary from any other party hereto,
                  that (a) any representation made or deemed to be made by an
                  Obligor in connection with the Finance Documents is true, (b)
                  no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default has
                  occurred, (c) any Obligor is in breach of or default under its
                  obligations under the Finance Documents and (d) any right,
                  power, authority or discretion vested herein upon an
                  Instructing Group, the Banks or any other person or group of
                  persons has not been exercised;

        29.2.2    assume that (a) the Facility Office of each Bank is that
                  notified to it by such Bank in writing and (b) the information
                  provided by each Bank pursuant to Clause 34 (Notices), Clause
                  29.15 (Banks' Mandatory Cost Details) and Schedule 7
                  (Mandatory Costs) is true and correct in all respect until it
                  has received from such Bank notice of a change to the Facility
                  Office or any such information and act upon any such notice
                  until the same is superseded by a further notice;

        29.2.3    engage and pay for the advice or services of any lawyers,
                  accountants, surveyors or other experts whose advice or
                  services may to it seem necessary, expedient or desirable and
                  rely upon any advice so obtained;

        29.2.4    rely as to any matters of fact which might reasonably be
                  expected to be within the knowledge of an Obligor upon a
                  certificate signed by or on behalf of such Obligor;

<PAGE>   93
        29.2.5    rely upon any communication or document believed by it to be
                  genuine;

        29.2.6    refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion vested
                  in it as agent hereunder unless and until instructed by an
                  Instructing Group as to whether or not such right, power or
                  discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to be exercised,
                  as to the manner in which it should be exercised;

        29.2.7    refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of an
                  Instructing Group to begin any legal action or proceeding
                  arising out of or in connection with the Finance Documents
                  until it shall have received such security as it may require
                  (whether by way of payment in advance or otherwise) for all
                  costs, claims, losses, expenses (including legal fees) and
                  liabilities together with any VAT thereon which it will or may
                  expend or incur in complying with such instructions.

        29.2.8    assume (unless it has specific notice to the contrary) that
                  any notice or request made by the Borrower is made on behalf
                  of all the Obligors.

29.3    AGENT'S OBLIGATIONS

        The Agent shall:

        29.3.1    promptly inform each Bank of the contents of any written
                  notice or document received by it in its capacity as Agent
                  from an Obligor under the Finance Documents;

        29.3.2    promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of any Event of
                  Default or any default by an Obligor in the due performance of
                  or compliance with its obligations under the Finance Documents
                  of which the Agent has notice from any other party hereto;

                  being declared to be immediately due and payable in accordance
                  with either Clause 19.16 (Acceleration and Cancellation) or
                  Clause 19.17 (Advances Due on Demand);

        29.3.5    save as otherwise provided herein, act as agent hereunder in
                  accordance with any instructions given to it by an Instructing
                  Group, which instructions shall be binding on the Arrangers
                  and the Banks;

        29.3.6    if so instructed by an Instructing Group, refrain from
                  exercising any right, power or discretion vested in it as
                  agent hereunder; and

        29.3.7    unless it has a Bank's consent, refrain from acting on behalf
                  of that Bank in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating
                  to any Finance Document.

        The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical
        and administrative in nature.

29.4    EXCLUDED OBLIGATIONS

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
        neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall:

        29.4.1    be bound to enquire as to (a) whether or not any

        29.4.3    be bound to disclose to any other person any information
                  relating to any member of the Group if (a) such information is
                  confidential or (b) such disclosure would or might in its
                  reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or a breach
                  of fiduciary duty;

        29.4.4    be under any obligations other than those for which express
                  provision is made herein; or

29.5    DELEGATION

        The Agent may delegate, transfer or assign to any of its holding
        companies, subsidiaries or subsidiaries of any of its holding companies
        all or any of the rights, powers, authorities and discretions vested in
        it under the Finance Documents and the performance of its duties in
        accordance therewith, and such delegation, transfer or assignment may be
        made upon such terms and subject to such conditions (including the power
        to sub-delegate) and subject to such regulations as the Agent may think
        fit (and the term "Agent" as used in this Agreement shall include any
        such delegate).

29.6    INDEMNIFICATION

        Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by the
        Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims, losses,
        expenses (including legal fees) and liabilities together with any VAT
        thereon which the Agent may incur, otherwise than by reason of its own
        gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in acting in its capacity as
        agent under the Finance Documents (other than any which have been
        reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Clause 24.1 (Borrowers'
        Indemnity)).

29.7    EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES

        Each Bank confirms that it has read the Notice to Recipients in the
        Information Memorandum, that it has complied with the Recipients'
        Obligations (as set out in the Notice to Recipients) and, accordingly,
        that it enters into this Agreement on the basis of the Notice to
        Recipients. In particular, each of the Banks accepts that it is entering
        into this Agreement in reliance only on the representations of the
        Obligors in this Agreement and on its own investigations, that it has
        not relied on the Arrangers and that, except as set out below, it
        neither has nor will have any claims against the Arrangers arising from
        or in connection with this Agreement. Similarly, each of the Banks
        accepts that the


                                       93
<PAGE>   95
        Notice to Recipients in the Information Memorandum is applicable also
        to the Agent as if the Agent had been named in addition to the
        Arrangers in the Important Notice.

        Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the
        Agent nor any Arranger accepts any responsibility to any of the Banks:

        29.7.1    for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum or any other information supplied by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers, by an Obligor or by any other
                  person in connection with the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
                  the Finance Documents;

        29.7.2    for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
                  the Finance Documents; or

        29.7.3    for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any
                  judgement, discretion or power given to any of them by or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents or any other agreement,
                  arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in
                  anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with the Finance
                  Documents.

        Accordingly, neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall be under any
        liability (whether in negligence or otherwise) in respect of such
        matters, save in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

29.8    NO ACTIONS

        Each of the Banks agrees that it will not assert or seek to assert
        against any director, officer or employee of the Agent or the Arrangers
        any claim it might have against any of them in respect of the matters
        referred to in Clause 29.7 (Exclusion of Liabilities).

29.9    BUSINESS WITH THE GROUP

        The Agent and the Arrangers may accept deposits from, lend money to and
        generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with any
        member of the Group whether or not it may or does lead to a conflict
        with the interests of any of the Banks. Similarly, the Agent or the
        Arrangers may undertake business with or for others even though it may
        lead to a conflict with the interests of any of the Banks.

29.10   RESIGNATION

        The Agent may resign its appointment hereunder at any time without
        assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than thirty days' prior
        notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto, PROVIDED THAT
        no such resignation shall be effective until a successor for the Agent
        is appointed in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this Clause
        29 (The Agent, the Arrangers and the Banks).

<PAGE>   96
29.11   REMOVAL OF AGENT

        An Instructing Group may, after consultation with the Borrower, remove
        the Agent from its role as agent under the Finance Documents by giving
        notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto. Such removal
        shall take effect only when a successor to the Agent is appointed in
        accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents.

29.12   SUCCESSOR AGENT

        If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 29.10
        (Resignation) or it is removed pursuant to Clause 29.11 (Removal of
        Agent), then any reputable and experienced bank or other financial
        institution may, with the prior consent of the Borrower be appointed as
        a successor to the Agent by an Instructing Group during the period of
        such notice but, if no such successor is so appointed, the Agent may
        appoint such a successor itself.

29.13   RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

        If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of Clause
        29.12 (Successor Agent), then (a) the retiring or departing Agent shall
        be discharged from any further obligation under the Finance Documents
        but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the provisions of this
        Clause 29 (The Agent, the Arrangers and the Banks) and (b) its successor
        and each of the other parties hereto shall have the same rights and
        obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor
        had been a party hereto.

29.14   OWN RESPONSIBILITY

        It is understood and agreed by each Bank that at all times it has itself
        been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own
        independent appraisal of and investigation into all risks arising under
        or in connection with the Finance Documents including, but not limited
        to:

        29.14.1   the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition, affairs,
                  status and nature of each member of the Group;

        29.14.2   the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy and
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents and any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection with
                  the Finance Documents;

        29.14.3   whether such Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of
                  that recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any
                  of their respective assets under or in connection with the
                  Finance Documents, the transactions therein contemplated or
                  any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into,
                  made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents; and

        29.14.4   the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the Information
                  Memorandum and any other information provided by the Agent or

                  connection with the Finance Documents, the transactions
                  contemplated therein or any other agreement, arrangement or
                  document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
                  pursuant to or in connection with the Finance Documents.


                                       95
<PAGE>   97
        Accordingly, each Bank acknowledges to the Agent and the Arrangers that
        it has not relied on and will not hereafter rely on the Agent and the
        Arrangers or any of them in respect of any of these matters.

29.15   BANKS' MANDATORY COST DETAILS

        Each Bank will supply the Agent with such information and in such detail
        as the Agent may require in order to calculate the Mandatory Cost Rate

29.16   RECEIPT OF INFORMATION BY THE AGENT

        expressly set out in this Agreement and, unless the Agent's agency
        department shall have received information or documents in accordance

30.3    ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFERS BY BANKS

        30.3.1    Any Bank may, at any time, assign all or any of its rights and
                  benefits hereunder or transfer in accordance with Clause 30.5
                  (Transfers by Banks) all or any of its rights, benefits and
                  obligations hereunder to, or enter into any form of
                  sub-participation agreement with, a bank or financial
                  institution, provided that such Bank procures that the

                  Intercreditor Accession Deed in the form attached to the
                  Intercreditor Agreement.

        30.3.2    The prior written consent of the Borrower (which shall be
                  deemed to be given on its own behalf and on behalf of the
                  other Obligors) is required for an assignment or transfer by a

        30.3.3    The Borrower's consent must not be (a) unreasonably delayed or
                  withheld or (b) withheld solely because the assignment or
                  transfer may result in an increase to the Mandatory Cost Rate.

30.4    ASSIGNMENTS BY BANKS

        If any Bank assigns all or any of its rights and benefits under the
        Finance Documents in accordance with Clause 30.3 (Assignments and

        notice to the Agent confirming in favour of the Agent, the Arrangers and
        the other Banks that it shall be under the same obligations towards each
        of them as it would have been under if it had been an original party
        hereto as a Bank (whereupon such assignee shall become a party hereto as
        a "BANK"), the Agent, the Arrangers and the other Banks shall not be
        obliged to recognise such assignee as having the rights against each of
        them which it would have had if it had been such a party hereto.

30.5    TRANSFERS BY BANKS

        If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and/or
        obligations under the Finance Documents as contemplated in Clause 30.3
        (Assignments and Transfers by Banks), then such transfer may be effected
        by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed Transfer Certificate
        executed by such Bank and the relevant Transferee in which event, on the
        later of the Transfer Date specified in such Transfer Certificate and
        the fifth Business Day after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by
        the Agent on such Transfer Certificate falling on or after) the date of
        delivery of such Transfer Certificate to the Agent:

        30.5.1    to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Bank party
                  thereto seeks to transfer by novation its rights, benefits and
                  obligations under the Finance Documents, each of the Obligors
                  and such Bank shall be released from further obligations
                  towards one another under the Finance Documents and their
                  respective rights against one another shall be cancelled (such
                  rights and obligations being referred to in this Clause 30.5
                  (Transfer by Banks) as "DISCHARGED RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS");

        30.5.2    each of the Obligors and the Transferee party thereto shall
                  assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights
                  against one another which differ from such discharged rights
                  and obligations only insofar as the Obligors and such
                  Transferee have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of
                  the Obligors and such Bank;

        30.5.3    the Agent, the Arrangers, such Transferee and the other Banks
                  shall acquire the same rights and benefits and assume the same
                  obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and
                  assumed had such Transferee been an original party hereto as a
                  Bank with the rights, benefits and/or obligations acquired or
                  assumed by it as a result of such transfer and to that extent
                  the Agent, the Arrangers and the relevant Bank shall each be
                  released from further obligations to each other under the
                  Finance Documents; and

        30.5.4    such Transferee shall become a party hereto as a "BANK".

        30.7.1    a Bank assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations
                  under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office;
                  and

        30.7.2    as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the
                  assignment, transfer or change of Facility Office, an Obligor
                  would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee, Transferee

        acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the
        assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

        The Borrower may request that any member of the Parent Covenant Group
        become a Guarantor by delivering to the Agent a Guarantor Accession
        Memorandum duly executed by the Borrower and such member of the Parent
        Covenant Group, together with the documents and other evidence listed in

38.     GOVERNING LAW

        This Agreement is governed by English law.

39.     JURISDICTION

39.1    ENGLISH COURTS

        The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute
        (a "DISPUTE") arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
        (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity or termination of
        this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity).

39.2    CONVENIENT FORUM

        The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate
        and convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and, accordingly,
        that they will not argue to the contrary.

39.3    NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION

        This Clause 39 (Jurisdiction) is for the benefit of the Finance Parties
        only. As a result and notwithstanding Clause 39.1 (English Courts), it
        does not prevent any Finance Party from taking proceedings relating to a
        Dispute ("PROCEEDINGS") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the
        extent allowed by law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent
        Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

39.4    SERVICE OF PROCESS

        Each Guarantor (other than the Intermediate Parent), agrees that the
        documents which start any Proceedings and any other documents required
        to be served in relation to those Proceedings may be served on it by
        service of such documents on NTL Group Limited at NTL House, Bartley
        Wood Business Park, Hook, Hampshire RG27 9XA (marked for the attention
        of Robert Mackenzie) or, if different, its registered office.

        If any Guarantor ceases to have a place of business in Great Britain or,
        as the case may be, the appointment of the person mentioned in this
        Clause 39.4 ceases to be effective, such person shall immediately
        appoint another person in England to accept service of process on its
        behalf in England. If any Guarantor fails to do so (and such failure
        continues for a period of not less than fourteen days), the Agent shall
        be entitled to


                                      104
<PAGE>   106
         appoint such a person by notice to such person. Nothing contained
         herein shall restrict the right to serve process in any other manner
         allowed by law. This Clause 39.4 applies to Proceedings in England and
         to Proceedings elsewhere.

40.      INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT

         Each Obligor acknowledges that the Banks have entered into the
         Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Clause 2.1
         (Waiver of Drawdown Conditions) thereof and that they have been
         provided with a copy thereof. Each Obligor acknowledges that (x)
         neither it nor any other member of the Group nor any other person shall
         be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of the Intercreditor
         Agreement or have any right to enforce or cause the enforcement of any
         right, remedy or obligation of any party to the Intercreditor Agreement
         and (y) the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement can be amended,
         modified, waived or terminated without their consent. The Agent shall
         notify the Borrower of any such amendment, modification, waiver or
         termination promptly after its occurrence.

                                   SCHEDULE 7
                                 MANDATORY COSTS

1.      The Mandatory Cost Rate is an addition to the interest rate to
        compensate Banks for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of
        the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in
        either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its
        functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.

2.      On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible
        thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the
        "ADDITIONAL COSTS RATE") for each Bank, in accordance with the formula
        set out below. The Mandatory Cost Rate will be calculated by the Agent
        as a weighted average of the Banks' additional costs rates rounded to
        five decimal places (weighted in proportion to the percentage
        participation of each Bank in the relevant Advance) and will be
        expressed as a percentage rate per annum.

3.      The additional costs rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office in
        a Participating Member State will be notified by that Bank to the Agent
        as the cost of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the
        European Central Bank.

4.      The additional cost rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office in
        the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:

                 AB + C (B-D) + E x 0.01
                 -----------------------  per cent. per annum.
                        100 - (A+C)

        Where:

        A         is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to
                  be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Bank is from
                  time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash
                  ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash
                  ratio requirements.

        B         is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Margin and
                  the Mandatory Cost Rate) payable for the relevant Interest
                  Period of the Loan.

        C         is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that
                  Bank is required from time to time to maintain as interest
                  bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.

        D         is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of
                  England to the Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.

        E         is the rate of charge payable by that Bank to the Financial
                  Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Regulations (but, for
                  this purpose, ignoring any minimum fee required pursuant to
                  the Fees Regulations) and expressed in pounds per L1,000,000
                  of the Fee Base of that Bank.


                                       1
<PAGE>   118
5.      For the purposes of this Schedule:

        (a)       "ELIGIBLE LIABILITIES" and "SPECIAL DEPOSITS" have the
                  meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to
                  the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the
                  Bank of England;

        (b)       "FEES REGULATIONS" means the Banking Supervision (Fees)
                  Regulations 1999 or such other law or regulation as may be in
                  force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for
                  banking supervision; and

        (c)       "FEE BASE" has the meaning given to it, and will be calculated
                  in accordance with, the Fees Regulations.

6.      In application of the above formula, A, B, C and D will be included in
        the formula as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in the
        formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by
        subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.

7.      Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Agent for the
        purpose of calculating its additional costs rate. In particular, but
        without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information in
        writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank:

        (a)       its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of its
                  Facility Office; and

        (b)       such other information that the Agent may reasonably require
                  for such purpose.

        Each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any change to
        the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

8.      The percentages or rates of charge of each Bank for the purpose of A, C
        and E above shall be determined by the Agent based upon the information
        supplied to it pursuant to paragraph 7 above and on the assumption that
        unless a Bank notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Bank's
        obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits, Special Deposits and the
        Fee Regulations are the same as those of a typical bank from its
        jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same
        jurisdiction as its Facility Office.

        The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination
        results in an additional costs rate which over or under compensates any
        Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by
        any Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 7 above is true and correct in all
        respects.

9.      The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received pursuant to
        the Mandatory Cost Rate to the Banks on basis of the additional cost
        rate incurred by each Bank, as calculated in accordance with the above
        formula and based on the information provided by each Bank pursuant to
        paragraphs 3 and 7 above.

10.     Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to
        a formula, the Mandatory Cost Rate, an additional costs rate or any
        amount payable to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
        conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.


                                       2

11.     The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Parent (on
        behalf of the Borrowers) and the Banks, determine and notify to all
        parties any amendments or variations which are required to be made to
        this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or
        any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the
        Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in either
        case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions)
        and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
        conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.
