Agreement Year shall not exceed the amounts set forth in the section entitled

          in sub-paragraph (b) of the section entitled REINSURANCE PREMIUM for
          the Agreement Year multiplied by the amount of the reinstated Limit of
          Liability of the Reinsurer divided by $5,000,000;

     (d)  For the next $5,000,000, so reinstated in the Third Excess Cover, the

          the Agreement Year multiplied by the amount of the reinstated Limit of
          Liability of the Reinsurer divided by $5,000,000.
