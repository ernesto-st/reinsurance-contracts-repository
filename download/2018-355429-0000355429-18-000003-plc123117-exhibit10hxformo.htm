and said Section 145 further empowers a corporation to "purchase and maintain insurance" on behalf of any of such persons "against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under" Section 145;

 however, upon receiving such information, the Board of Directors of Company concluded that at present, due to the high cost and other negative features of the coverage available at the date hereof, it would not be in the best interests of its shareholders for Company to purchase and maintain an adequate amount of such insurance and that, on the contrary, its shareholders' interests would be better served by Company's contracting to indemnify such persons and thereby to effectively self-insure against such potential liabilities in excess of, and in certain instances against liabilities excluded from, the $10,000,000 insurance policy obtained by Company effective May 8, 1989 and any additional acceptable coverage which from time to time hereafter may be placed in force (hereinafter collectively the "Policy") provided that the aggregate liability of Company hereunder (stated as $10,000,000 in Section 9(g) below) shall be reduced by the amounts insured under the Policy as in effect at any given time;
