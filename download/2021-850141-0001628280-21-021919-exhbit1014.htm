Notwithstanding Section 9.5, in the event Buyer  receives notice of a claim by a Governmental Authority in respect of Taxes of the Company or  Abacus (other than Taxes imposed under any U.S. federal, state and local consolidated, affiliated,  combined or similar Tax Returns that include Parent, the Company and Abacus) for any Tax period  ending on or before the Closing Date (a &#8220;Tax Claim&#8221;), Buyer shall give written notice to Parent of  such claim; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve Parent from  any obligation under this Agreement unless Parent is actually harmed by such failure.

Buyer may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and  expense and consult in the defense of the Tax Claim.

If Parent does not assume the defense of any Tax Claim  (including if Parent does not deliver the notice required by this Section 8.4), Buyer may defend  such Tax Claim at the sole cost and expense of Parent.  In any such case, Buyer will not consent  to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim without the prior  written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).   If Parent conducts the defense of a Tax Claim, Parent will keep Buyer reasonably informed as to  the status of such Tax Claim, including all compromise or settlement offers.  Parent shall consult  with Buyer prior to the settlement of any such Tax Claim and shall obtain the prior written consent  of Buyer prior to the settlement of any such Tax Claim that would adversely affect Buyer or its  Affiliates in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (such consent not to be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed).  8.5 Cooperation on Tax Matters.  Buyer and Parent shall cooperate fully, as and to the  extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns  pursuant to this Article VIII and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes.  Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party&#8217;s request) the provision of  records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other  Proceeding and making Employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional  information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with  the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by Parent.  Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer and the Company (following Closing) shall be  entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such  amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or under any provision  Tax Law. Buyer, Parent and Seller shall cooperate, and Parent and Seller shall cause the Company  to cooperate, as reasonably requested by another party to establish any applicable exemption or  reduction to such deduction or withholding, including by providing any applicable withholding  forms or certificates. Amounts deducted and withheld pursuant to this Agreement will be treated  as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.  8.7 Section 338(h)(10) Election.    (a) Buyer and Parent may make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the  Code and comparable provisions of state law with respect to the Company, Abacus, or both (a  &#8220;Section 338(h)(10) Election&#8221;) and if elected will timely file with the proper authorities executed  copies of Internal Revenue Service Forms 8023 and 8883, and any similar state forms, with respect  to the Company and Abacus, as applicable.

Within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, Parent shall deliver to Buyer written notice indicating  whether Parent disagrees with the Buyer&#8217;s Allocation.  If Parent agrees with the Buyer&#8217;s  Allocation, or if Parent fails to deliver such written notice within thirty (30) days the Buyer&#8217;s  Allocation shall constitute the agreed-upon Allocation (the &#8220;Agreed Allocation&#8221;).  If Parent  provides timely written notice to Buyer of any disagreement with the Buyer&#8217;s Allocation, the  parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the Agreed Allocation.  If they do not reach  agreement within thirty (30) days after commencing negotiations, the parties shall promptly submit  the items in dispute to a mutually agreed-upon nationally-recognized accounting firm (or if they  cannot mutually agree on such firm, each party shall select a nationally-recognized accounting  firm which two firms shall agree on a third nationally-recognized accounting firm) (the  &#8220;Accounting Arbitrator&#8221;) to resolve the dispute.  The Accounting Arbitrator shall determine the  Agreed Allocation in accordance with the Treasury Regulations, and deliver to Buyer and Parent  the Agreed Allocation as soon as possible, but not later than the thirtieth day after the Accounting  Arbitrator is instructed to resolve the dispute. Any expenses relating to the engagement of the  Accounting Arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties.  (c) Each of the parties shall file or cause to be filed all relevant Tax Returns consistent  with the Agreed Allocation and shall not take any position inconsistent with the Agreed Allocation.  </FONT></DIV>

If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or  incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of  this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of  the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to the parties.
