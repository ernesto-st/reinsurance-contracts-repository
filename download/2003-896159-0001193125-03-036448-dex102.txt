     determined in accordance with the Company's financial statements at that
     time.

          (b)  For purposes of this Agreement, the Dollar Equivalent of each
     Loan that is an Alternate Currency Loan shall be calculated on the date
     when any such Loan is made, on the second Business Day of each month, or
     such date as a Borrower may request and at such other times as designated
     by the Agent at any time when a Potential Default or an Event of Default
     exists. Such Dollar Equivalent shall remain in effect until the same is
     recalculated by the Agent as provided above and notice of such
     recalculation is received by the Borrowers, it being understood that until
     such notice is received, the Dollar Equivalent shall be that Dollar
     Equivalent as last reported to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent.
     The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Banks of each such
     determination of the Dollar Equivalent.

                     REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN FACILITY
                     ---------------------------------------

          Section 2.01 Revolving Credit Commitments; Term Loans. (a) Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and
warranties herein set forth, each Bank severally agrees to make Revolving Credit
Loans to either Borrower (on a several basis) at any time or from time to time
on or after the date hereof to the Expiration Date, which Revolving Credit Loans
(i) may be made and maintained in such Approved Currency as is requested by the
applicable Borrower (provided that the aggregate Principal Amount of Revolving
Credit Loans denominated in Alternate Currencies shall not exceed $12,500,000
and only the UK Borrower may incur Alternate Currency Loans) and (ii) shall not,
in the case of Revolving Credit Loans incurred by the UK Borrower, when added to
the outstanding Principal Amount of all Bid Loans incurred by the UK Borrower,
exceed $12,500,000 in aggregate Principal Amount outstanding at any time for all
such Revolving Credit Loans and Bid Loans; provided that, after giving effect to
each such Loan, the aggregate amount of Loans from such Bank shall not exceed
such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment. Within such limits of time and amount
and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may borrow,
repay, and reborrow Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.01(a).

          (b)  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
each Borrower and each Bank which has Dollar-denominated Revolving Credit Loans
outstanding at such time agree that at 9:00 A.M., New York time, on the
Expiration Date, the aggregate principal amount of Dollar-denominated Revolving
Credit Loans owing to such Bank and outstanding at such time shall (unless such
Revolving Credit Loans have been declared (or have become) due and payable
pursuant to this Agreement), upon written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) by the respective Borrower to the Agent requesting such
conversion, automatically convert to and thereafter constitute Term Loans owing
to such Bank hereunder. The Term Loans of each Bank (i) shall be made and
thereafter maintained in Dollars; (ii) shall, at the option of the applicable
Borrower, be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans, provided that all Term Loans
comprising the same Borrowing Tranche shall, unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, consist of Term Loans of the same type; and (iii) shall not
exceed in initial

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

Principal Amount for such Bank an amount which equals the total principal amount
of Dollar-denominated Revolving Credit Loans owed to such Bank and outstanding
at 9:00 A.M., New York time, on the Expiration Date. Once repaid, Term Loans may
not be reborrowed.

          Section 2.02 Nature of Banks' Obligations with Respect to Revolving
Credit Loans. Each Bank shall be obligated to participate in each request for
Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.05 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests]
in accordance with its Ratable Share. The aggregate Principal Amount of each
Bank's Revolving Credit Loans outstanding hereunder to the Borrowers at any time
shall never exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment. The obligations of each Bank
hereunder are several and not joint. The failure of any Bank to perform its
obligations hereunder shall not affect the Obligations of the Borrowers to any
other party nor shall any other party be liable for the failure of such Bank to
perform its obligations hereunder. The Banks shall have no obligation to make
Revolving Credit Loans hereunder on or after the Expiration Date.

          Section 2.03 Facility Fees; Term Loan Fee. (a) Accruing from the date
hereof until but not including the Expiration Date, the Company agrees to pay to
the Agent for the account of each Bank, as consideration for such Bank's
Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, a non-refundable facility fee (the
"Facility Fee") equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate (computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days for the actual days elapsed) on the average daily amount
of such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment as the same may be constituted from
time to time, regardless of usage. All Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears
on the first Business Day of each June, September, December, and March after the
date hereof and on the Expiration Date or upon acceleration of the Loans.

          (b)  Accruing on the Expiration Date to but not including the Term
Loan Maturity Date, the Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the pro rata
account of each Bank, a non-refundable fee (the "Term Loan Fee"), equal to
0.125% of the average daily aggregate outstanding Principal Amount of the Term
Loans. The Term Loan Fee shall be payable in arrears on the first Business Day
of each March, June, September, and December after the Expiration Date and on
the date the Term Loans are repaid in their entirety.

          Section 2.04 Utilization Fee. On each day on which the Facility Usage
exceeds 33.3% of the amount of the Commitments (or, after the Expiration Date,
the Commitments as in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Date), the
Applicable Margin shall be increased for such day by the Applicable Usage
Premium.

          Section 2.05 Revolving Credit Loan Requests. Except as otherwise
provided herein, a Borrower may from time to time prior to the Expiration Date
request the Banks to make Revolving Credit Loans in Dollars, or renew or convert
the Interest Rate Option applicable to existing Revolving Credit Loans or Term

Base Rate Option shall apply to the proposed Loans comprising the applicable
Borrowing Tranche; and (vi) in the case of a Borrowing Tranche to which the

          Section 2.06 Making Revolving Credit Loans. The Agent shall, promptly
after receipt by it of a Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.05 [Revolving Credit
Loan Requests], notify the Banks of its receipt of such Loan Request specifying:
(i) the applicable Borrower making the Loan Request; (ii) the proposed Borrowing

Loans as determined by the Agent in accordance with Section 2.02 [Nature of
Banks' Obligations]. Each Bank shall remit the principal amount of each

shall, to the extent the Banks have made funds available to it for such purpose
and subject to Section 6.02 [Each Additional Loan], fund such Revolving Credit
Loans to the applicable Borrower in the applicable Approved Currency and
immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 2:00 p.m., New York
time, on the applicable Borrowing Date, provided that if any Bank fails to remit
such funds to the Agent in a timely manner, the Agent may elect in its sole
discretion to fund with its own funds the Revolving Credit Loans of such Bank on
such Borrowing Date, and such Bank shall be subject to the repayment obligation
in Section 9.16 [Availability of Funds].

          Section 2.07 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit
Loans shall be used for the working capital and other general corporate purposes
of the Borrowers and in accordance with Section 7.01(j) [Use of Proceeds].

          Section 2.08 Bid Loan Facility. (a) Bid Loan Requests. Except as

Borrowing Date if the applicable Borrower is requesting Fixed Rate Bid Loans and

months' duration. Each Bid Loan Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify
(i) the identity of the applicable Borrower; (ii) the respective Approved
Currency for such Loan; (iii) the proposed Bid Loan Borrowing Date; (iv) whether
the applicable Borrower is electing the Bid Loan Fixed Rate Option or the Bid
Loan LIBOR Option; (v) the term of the proposed Bid Loan (the "Bid Loan Interest

hundred eighty (180) days if the applicable Borrower is requesting a Fixed Rate
Bid Loan and one, two, three, or six months if the applicable Borrower is
requesting a LIBOR Bid Loan; and (vi) the maximum principal amount (the

Loan and any other Loan made on or before the Bid Loan Borrowing Date, the
aggregate Principal Amount of all Revolving Credit Loans and Bid Loans
outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments of the Banks. In addition, after giving effect to any such Bid Loan
incurred by the UK Borrower and any other Loan made on or before the Bid Loan
Borrowing Date, the aggregate Principal Amount of all Bid Loans and Revolving
Credit Loans incurred by the UK Borrower shall not exceed $12,500,000 in
Principal Amount outstanding. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, no Bid Loan may be requested for a period that would end beyond the
Expiration Date.

          (b)  Bidding. The Agent shall promptly after receipt by it of a Bid
Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.08(a) notify the Banks of its receipt of such
Bid Loan Request specifying (i) the identity of the applicable Borrower, (ii)

(v) the principal amount of the proposed Bid Loan and (vi) in the case of an
Alternate Currency Loan to be incurred by the UK Borrower, the Alternate
Currency for such Bid Loan. Each Bank may submit a bid (a "Bid") to the Agent by
telephone (immediately confirmed in writing by letter, facsimile, email, or
telex) not later than the following (each, as applicable, a "Bid Deadline"):
10:00 A.M. New York time two (2) Business Day before the proposed Bid Loan
Borrowing Date if the applicable Borrower is requesting a Fixed Rate Bid Loan or
10:00 A.M. New York time three (3) Business Days before the proposed Bid Loan
Borrowing Date if the applicable Borrower is requesting a LIBOR Bid Loan of one,
two, three, or six months' duration. Each Bid shall specify: (A) the principal
amount of proposed Bid Loans offered by such Bank (the "Offered Amount") which
(i) may be less than, but shall not exceed, the Requested Amount, (ii) shall be
at least $2,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and (iii)
may exceed such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment; and (B) the Fixed Rate which
shall apply to such proposed Bid Loan if the applicable Borrower has requested a
Fixed Rate Bid Loan or the LIBOR Bid Loan Spread which shall apply to such
proposed Bid Loan if Borrower has requested a LIBOR Bid Loan and which may be a
positive or negative number. If any Bid omits information required hereunder,
the Agent may in its sole discretion attempt to notify the Bank submitting such
Bid. If the Agent so notifies a Bank, such Bank may resubmit its Bid provided
that it does so prior to the applicable Bid Deadline. The Agent shall promptly
notify the applicable Borrower of the Bids which it timely received from the
Banks. If the Agent in its capacity as a Bank shall, in its sole discretion,
make a Bid, it shall notify the Borrower of such Bid at least one-half hour
before the

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

applicable Bid Deadline.

          (c)  Accepting Bids. The applicable Borrower, at its option, shall
irrevocably accept or reject Bids by notifying the Agent of such acceptance or
rejection by telephone (immediately confirmed in writing by letter, facsimile,
email, or telex) not later than one hour after the applicable Bid Deadline. If
the applicable Borrower elects to accept any Bids, its acceptance must meet the
following conditions: (1) the total amount which the applicable Borrower accepts
from all Banks must not be less than $10,000,000 and shall be in integral
multiples of $1,000,000 and may not exceed the Requested Amount; (2) the
applicable Borrower must accept Bids based solely on the amount of the Fixed
Rates or LIBOR Bid Loan Spreads, as the case may be, which each of the Banks
quoted in their Bids in ascending order of the amount of Fixed Rates or LIBOR
Bid Loan Spreads; (3) the applicable Borrower may not borrow Bid Loans from any
Bank on the Bid Loan Borrowing Date in an amount exceeding such Bank's Offered
Amount; (4) if two or more Banks make Bids at the same Fixed Rate (if the
applicable Borrower Requested a Fixed Rate Bid Loan) or LIBOR Bid Loan Spread
(if the applicable Borrower Requested a LIBOR Bid Loan) and the applicable
Borrower desires to accept a portion but not all of the Bids at such Fixed Rate
or LIBOR Bid Loan Spread, as the case may be, the applicable Borrower shall
accept a portion of each Bid equal to the product of the Offered Amount of such
Bid times the fraction obtained by dividing the total amount of Bids which the
applicable Borrower desires to accept at such Fixed Rate or LIBOR Bid Loan
Spread, as the case may be, by the sum of the Offered Amounts of the Bids at
such Fixed Rate or LIBOR Bid Loan Spread, provided that the applicable Borrower
shall round the Bid Loans allocated to each such Bank upward or downward as the
applicable Borrower may select to integral multiples of $1,000,000. The Agent
shall (i) promptly notify a Bank that has made a Bid of the amount of its Bid
that was accepted or rejected by the applicable Borrower and (ii) as promptly as
practical notify all of the Banks of all Bids submitted and those which have
been accepted.

          (d)  Funding Bid Loans. Each Bank whose Bid or portion thereof is
accepted shall remit the principal amount of its Bid Loan to the Agent by 12:00
Noon on the Bid Loan Borrowing Date. The Agent shall make such funds available
to the applicable Borrower on or before 1:00 P.M. on the Borrowing Date provided
that the conditions precedent to the making of such Bid Loan set forth in
Section 6.02 have been satisfied not later than 10:00 A.M. New York time on the
proposed Bid Loan Borrowing Date. If such conditions precedent have not been
satisfied prior to such time, then (i) the Agent shall not make such funds
available to the applicable Borrower, (ii) the Bid Loan Request shall be deemed
to be canceled, (iii) the Agent shall return the amount previously funded to the
Agent by each applicable Bank no later than the next following Business Day, and
(iv) the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to each such Bank for any loss,
costs, and expenses applicable pursuant to Section 4.06(b) [Indemnity]. The
applicable Borrower shall immediately notify the Agent of any failure to satisfy
the conditions precedent to the making of Bid Loans under Section 6.02. The
Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has satisfied such conditions
precedent if the applicable Borrower (i) has delivered to the Agent any
documents required to be delivered under Section 6.02, (ii) the applicable
Borrower has not notified the Agent that any other conditions precedent have not
been satisfied, and (iii) the Agent has no actual notice of such a failure.

          (e)  Several Obligations. The obligations of the Banks to make Bid
Loans after their Bids have been accepted are several. No Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

any other Bank to make any Bid Loan which another Bank has agreed to make.

          (f)  Bid Notes. The obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Bid Loans made to it by each Bank,
together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a Bid Note dated as of the
Closing Date payable to the order of such Bank in a face amount equal to the
aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of all of the Banks.

          Section 2.09 Extension by Banks of the Expiration Date. (a) Requests;
Approval by All Banks. No earlier than forty-five (45) days prior to the
Expiration Date, the Company may request an extension of the Expiration Date for
another 364 days by written notice to the Banks, and the Banks agree to respond
to the Company's request for an extension no earlier than thirty (30) and no
later than twenty (20) days prior to the then applicable Expiration Date;
provided, however, that the failure of any Bank to respond within such time
period shall not in any manner constitute an agreement by such Bank to extend
the Expiration Date. If all Banks elect to extend, the Expiration Date shall be
extended for a period of 364 days. If one or more Banks decline to extend or do
not respond to the Company's request, the provisions of Section 2.09 shall
apply.

          (b)  Approval by Required Banks. In the event that one or more Banks
do not agree to extend the Expiration Date or do not respond to the Company's
request for an extension within the time required under Section 2.09 (each a
"Bank to be Terminated"), but the Required Banks agree to such extension within
such time: then, on or before the then applicable Expiration Date, the Company
may, with the prior written approval of the Agent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), arrange to have one or more other banks reasonably
acceptable to the Agent (each an "Assignee Bank") purchase all of the
outstanding Loans, if any, of the Bank to be Terminated and succeed to and
assume all of the Commitments and all other rights, interests, and obligations
of the Bank to be Terminated under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Any such purchase and assumption shall be (1) pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, (2) subject to and in accordance with Section 10.11
[Successors and Assigns], and (3) if any Committed Loans are outstanding under
the Committed Loan LIBOR Option or if any Bid Loans are outstanding to such Bank
to be Terminated, the Borrowers shall pay all such outstanding amounts, together
with all interest, fees and all other amounts of any nature owing to the Bank to
be Terminated on the effective date of such Assignment and Assumption Agreement
(including any amounts owing under Section 4.06(b) [Indemnity]. In the event
that the Agent shall become a Bank to be Terminated, the provisions of this
Section 2.09 shall be subject to Section 9.14 [Successor Agent]. In the event
that the Loans and Commitments of a Bank to be Terminated are not fully assigned
and assumed pursuant to this Section 2.09(b) on or before the then applicable
Expiration Date, then the Expiration Date shall not be extended for any Bank.

          Section 2.10 UK Borrower Loans. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the UK Borrower shall not be permitted to incur any
Loans hereunder unless and until the following conditions precedent have been
satisfied:

                                      -24-

          (i)   Secretary's Certificate. There shall be delivered to the Agent
     for the benefit of each Bank a certificate signed by the Secretary or an
     Assistant Secretary of the UK Borrower, certifying as appropriate as to:

                (A)  all action taken by the UK Borrower in connection with this
          Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

                (B)  the names of the officer or officers authorized to sign
          this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the true signatures of
          such officer or officers and specifying the Authorized Officers
          permitted to act on behalf of the UK Borrower for purposes of this
          Agreement and the true signatures of such officers, on which the Agent
          and each Bank may conclusively rely; and

                (C)  copies of its organizational documents, including its
          certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on
          the date such Secretary's Certificate is executed and if applicable,
          certified by the appropriate official where such documents are filed
          in an office.

          (ii)  Opinion of Counsel. There shall be delivered to the Agent for
     the benefit of each Bank one or more written opinions of counsel for the UK
     Borrower in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent and its counsel:

                (A)  as to the matters set forth in Exhibit 6.01(d); and

                (B)  as to such other matters incident to the transactions
          contemplated herein as the Agent may reasonably request.

          (iii) The UK Borrower shall have received permission from the United
     Kingdom Financial Services Authority under Part IV of the Financial
     Services and Markets Act 2000 to effect and carry out contracts of
     insurance.

          (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the UK Borrower will not be permitted to borrow or incur any new Loans hereunder
at any time after the UK Borrower ceases to be a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                 INTEREST RATES
                                 --------------

          Section 3.01 Interest Rate Options. Each Borrower shall pay interest
in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Committed Loans as
selected by it from the Base Rate Option or Revolving Credit LIBOR Option set
forth below applicable to the Committed Loans, it being understood that, subject
to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may select different Interest
Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply to different Borrowing
Tranches of the Committed Loans and may convert to or renew one or more Interest
Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Committed Loans
comprising any Borrowing Tranche, provided that there shall not be at any one
time outstanding more than eight

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

(8) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Committed Loans. If at
any time the designated rate applicable to any Committed Loan made by any Bank
exceeds such Bank's highest lawful rate, the rate of interest on such Bank's
Committed Loan shall be limited to such Bank's highest lawful rate.

          (a)  Revolving Credit Interest Rate Options. Each Borrower shall have
     the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to
     the Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans incurred by it:

               (i)   Revolving Credit Base Rate Option: A fluctuating rate per
          annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case
          may be, for the actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the
          Applicable Margin, such interest rate to change automatically from
          time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the
          Base Rate; or

               (ii)  Revolving Credit LIBOR Option: A rate per annum (computed
          on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual days elapsed) equal
          to the applicable LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin.

          (b)  Rate Quotations. The Borrowers may call the Agent on or before
     the date on which a Committed Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an
     indication of the rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such
     projection shall not be binding on the Agent or the Banks nor affect the
     rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election
     is otherwise made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (c)  Change in Fees or Interest Rates. If the Applicable Margin or
     Applicable Fee Amount is increased or reduced with respect to any period
     for which any Borrower has already paid interest or Facility Fees, the
     Agent shall recalculate the additional interest or Facility Fees due from
     or the amount of the refund of interest or Facility Fees due to such
     Borrower and shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Agent
     received the information which gave rise to such increase or decrease, give
     the applicable Borrower and the Banks notice of such recalculation.

               (i)   Any additional interest or Facility Fee due from any
          Borrower shall be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks on
          the next date on which an interest or fee payment is due; provided,
          however, that if there are no Loans outstanding or if the Loans are
          due and payable, such additional interest or Facility Fee shall be
          paid promptly after receipt of written request for payment from the
          Agent.

               (ii)  Any interest or Facility Fee refund due to any Borrower
          shall be credited against payments otherwise due from such Borrower on
          the next interest or fee payment date or, if the Loans have been
          repaid and the Banks are no longer committed to lend under this
          Agreement, the Banks shall pay the Agent for the account of such
          Borrower such interest or Facility Fee refund not later than five
          Business Days after written notice from the Agent to the Banks.

          Section 3.02 Committed Loans Interest Periods. At any time when any
Borrower shall select, convert to, or renew a Committed Loan LIBOR Option, the
applicable Borrower shall notify the Agent thereof at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the effective date of such LIBOR Option by delivering a Loan
Request. The notice shall specify a Committed Loan Interest Period during which
such Interest Rate Option shall apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
the following provisions shall apply to any selection of, renewal of, or
conversion to a Committed Loan LIBOR Option:

          (a)  Amount of Borrowing Tranche. Each Borrowing Tranche of Committed
     Loan LIBOR Loans shall be in integral multiples of $1,000,000 and not less
     than $5,000,000;

          (b)  Renewals. In the case of the renewal of a Committed Loan LIBOR
     Option at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest
     Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without
     duplication in payment of interest for such day.

          Section 3.03 Interest After Default. To the extent permitted by Law,
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of
Default shall have been cured or waived:

          (a)  Interest Rate. The rate of interest otherwise applicable for each
     Loan pursuant to Section 3.01 [Interest Rate Options] shall be increased by
     2.0% per annum; and

          (b)  Other Obligations. Each other Obligation hereunder if not paid
     when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
     rate of interest applicable under the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option
     plus an additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due
     and payable and until it is paid in full.

          (c)  Acknowledgment. The Borrowers acknowledge that the increase in
     rates referred to in this Section 3.03 reflects, among other things, the
     fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater
     risk given their default status and that the Banks are entitled to
     additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest referred to in
     this Section 3.03 shall be payable by the Borrowers upon demand by the
     Agent.

          Section 3.04 LIBOR Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs;
Deposits Not Available. (a) Unascertainable. If on any date on which LIBOR would
otherwise be determined with respect to Committed Loans or Bid Loans, the Agent
shall have determined that:

               (i)   adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining such
          LIBOR, or

               (ii)  a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely
          affects the respective London interbank market relating to LIBOR, the
          Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 3.04.

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

          (b)  Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available. If at any
time any Bank shall have determined that:

               (i)   the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a
          LIBOR Option applies has been made unlawful by compliance by such Bank
          in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application
          thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any
          such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or

               (ii)  such LIBOR Option will not adequately and fairly reflect
          the cost to such Bank of the establishment or maintenance of any such
          Loan, or

               (iii) after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the
          relevant amount in the relevant Approved Currency for the relevant
          Interest Period for a Loan to which a LIBOR Option applies are not
          available to such Bank with respect to such Loan in the respective
          London interbank market,

     then the Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 3.04(c).

          (c)  Agent's and Bank's Rights. In the case of any event specified in
Section 3.04(a) above, the Agent shall promptly so notify the Banks and the
Borrowers thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 3.04(b)
above, such Bank shall promptly so notify the Agent and endorse a certificate to
such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Agent shall
promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Banks and the
Borrowers. Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not
be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Banks,
in the case of such notice given by the Agent, or (B) such Bank, in the case of
such notice given by such Bank, to allow the Borrowers to select, convert to or
renew a LIBOR Option shall be suspended until the Agent shall have later
notified the Borrowers, or such Bank shall have later notified the Agent, of the
Agent's or such Bank's, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances
giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist. If at any time the
Agent makes a determination under Section 3.04(a) and any Borrower has
previously notified the Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a
LIBOR Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such
notification shall be deemed to provide for the termination of the applicable
Borrower's Bid Loan request (without penalty) for such Loans if the applicable
Borrower has requested Bid Loans under the Bid Loan LIBOR Option and for the
selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise
available with respect to such Loans if the applicable Borrower has requested
the Committed Loan LIBOR Option. If any Bank notifies the Agent of a
determination under Section 3.04(b), the Borrowers shall, subject to the
Borrowers' indemnification Obligations under Section 4.06(b) [Indemnity], as to
any Loan of the Bank to which a LIBOR Option applies, on the date specified in
such notice either convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available
with respect to such Loan (in the case of Dollar-denominated Loans) or prepay
such Loan in accordance with Section 4.04 [Voluntary Prepayments]. Absent due
notice from the Borrowers of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall
automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with
respect to such Loan upon such specified date in the case of Dollar-denominated
Loans, or prepaid on such date in the case of all other Loans.

          Section 3.05 Selection of Interest Rate Options. If any Borrower fails
to select a new Interest Period to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Committed
Loans under the Committed LIBOR Option at the expiration of an existing Interest
Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.01(c) [Interest Periods], the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to
have (i) in the case of Dollar-denominated Loans, converted such Borrowing
Tranche to the Revolving Credit Base Rate Option commencing upon the last day of
the existing Interest Period and (ii) in the case of Alternate Currency Loans,
selected a one-month Interest Period commencing upon the last day of the
existing Interest Period.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    PAYMENTS
                                    --------

          Section 4.01 Payments. All payments and prepayments to be made in
respect of principal, interest, Facility Fees, Term Loan Fees, Bid Loan
Processing Fees, Agent's Fee, or other fees or amounts due from the Borrowers
hereunder shall be payable prior to 11:00 A.M., New York time, on the date when
due without presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, and without set-off, counterclaim,
or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately
accrue. Such payments shall be made to the Agent at the Principal Office for the
ratable accounts of the Banks with respect to the Loans and for the account of
the lending Bank with respect to the Bid Loans, in the applicable Approved
Currency and in immediately available funds, and the Agent shall promptly
distribute such amounts to the Banks in immediately available funds, provided
that in the event payments are received by 11:00 A.M., New York time, by the
Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the
Banks on the same day received by the Agent, the Agent shall pay the Banks the
Federal Funds Effective Rate with respect to the amount of such payments for
each day held by the Agent and not distributed to the Banks. The Agent's and
each Bank's statement of account, ledger, or other relevant record shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of
principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this
Agreement.

          Section 4.02 Pro Rata Treatment of Banks. (a) Each borrowing of
Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to each Bank according to its Ratable
Share (irrespective of the amount of Bid Loans outstanding), and each selection
of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option applicable to Revolving
Credit Loans and each payment or prepayment by the Borrowers with respect to
principal or interest on the Revolving Credit Loans, Term Loans, Facility Fees
or Term Loan Fees or other fees (except for the Agent's Fee and the Bid Loan
Processing Fee) or amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder to the Banks with
respect to the Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans, shall (except as provided
in Section 3.04(c) [Agent's and Bank's Rights] in the case of an event specified
in Section 3.04 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable; Etc.], Section 4.04 [Replacement of
a Bank] or Section 4.06 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]) be
made in proportion to the applicable Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans, as
the case may be, outstanding from each Bank and, if no such Loans are then
outstanding, in proportion to the Ratable Share of each Bank. Each borrowing of
a Bid Loan shall be made according to the provisions in Section 2.08 hereof and
each payment or

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

prepayment by the Borrowers of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts from
the Borrowers with respect to Bid Loans shall be made to the Banks in proportion
to the amounts due to such Banks with respect to Bid Loans then outstanding.

          (b)  All Borrowings of Term Loans under this Agreement shall be
incurred by the Borrowers from the Banks pro rata on the basis of such Banks'
Commitments as in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Date.

          Section 4.03 Interest Payment Dates. Interest on Committed Loans to
which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on the
first Business Day of each June, September, December, and March after the date
hereof and on the Expiration Date or upon acceleration of the Loan. Interest on
Committed Loans and Bid Loans to which the LIBOR Option applies and Bid Loans to
which the Bid Loan Fixed Rate Option applies shall be due and payable on the
last day of each Interest Period for those Loans and, if such Interest Period is
longer than three (3) Months, also at the end of the third Month of such
Interest Period. Interest on payments of principal and other monetary
Obligations shall be due on the date such payment is due (whether on the stated
maturity date, upon acceleration, or otherwise) or if principal or such other
Obligation is paid earlier than the date when due, then on the date when paid.

          Section 4.04 Voluntary Prepayments. (a) Right to Prepay. Each Borrower
shall have the right at its option from time to time to prepay the Committed
Loans incurred by it in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as
provided in Section 4.04(b) below or in Section 4.06 [Additional Compensation in
Certain Circumstances]):

          (i)   at any time with respect to any Committed Loan to which the
     Base Rate Option applies,

          (ii)  on the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect
     to Committed Loans to which a LIBOR Option applies,

          (iii) on the date specified in a notice by any Bank pursuant to
     Section 3.04 [LIBOR Unascertainable, Etc.] with respect to any Committed
     Loan to which a LIBOR Option applies.

          Whenever any Borrower desires to prepay any part of the Committed
Loans, it shall provide a prepayment notice to the Agent by 12:00 Noon, New York
time, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of Revolving
Credit Loans or Term Loans to which a Base Rate Option applies and at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the date of prepayment of Revolving Credit
Loans or Term Loans to which a LIBOR Option applies setting forth the following
information:

          (x)  the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed
     prepayment is to be made;

          (y)  a statement indicating the application of the prepayment among
     the Borrowing Tranches of such Loans; and

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

          (z)  the total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall not
     be less than $1,000,000 or such lesser amount as may be outstanding under
     the Borrowing Tranche to be prepaid.

          The principal amount of the Committed Loans for which a prepayment
notice is given, together with interest and fees as have accrued on such
principal amount, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such
prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made;
provided, however, that failure of any Borrower to make payment in accordance
with a prepayment notice given by it shall not be an Event of Default in and of
itself. Except as provided in Section 3.04(c) [Agent's and Bank's rights], if
any Borrower prepays a Committed Loan, but fails to specify the applicable
Borrowing Tranche which the applicable Borrower is prepaying, the prepayment
shall be applied first to Committed Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies,
then to Loans to which the Committed Loan LIBOR Option applies. Any prepayment
hereunder and any failure of the applicable Borrower to make payment in
accordance with a prepayment notice provided by it shall be subject to the
applicable Borrower's Obligation to indemnify the Banks under Section 4.06(b)
[Indemnity].

          (b)  Replacement of a Bank. In the event any Bank (i) gives notice
under Section 3.04 [LIBOR Unascertainable, Etc.] or Section 3.04 [Increased
Costs, Etc.], (ii) does not fund Revolving Credit Loans or Bid Loans because the
making of such Loans would contravene any Law applicable to such Bank, or (iii)
becomes subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and
customary supervision), then the Company shall have the right at its option,
with the consent of the Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to
prepay the Loans of such Bank in whole, together with all interest accrued
thereon, and terminate such Bank's Commitment at any time after (x) receipt of
such Bank's notice under Section 3.04 [LIBOR Unascertainable, Etc.] or Section
4.06(a) [Increased Costs, Etc.], (y) the date such Bank has failed to fund
Revolving Credit Loans or Bid Loans because the making of such Loans would
contravene Law applicable to such Bank, or (z) the date such Bank became subject
to the control of an Official Body, as applicable; provided that the applicable
Borrower shall also pay to such Bank at the time of such prepayment any amounts
required under Section 4.06 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]
and any accrued interest due on such amount and any related fees; provided,
however, that the Commitment and any Bid Loan of such Bank shall be provided by
one or more of the remaining Banks or a replacement bank acceptable to the
Agent; provided, further, the remaining Banks shall have no obligation hereunder
to increase their Commitments or provide the Bid Loan of such Bank.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may only be replaced subject to the
requirements of Section 9.14 [Successor Agent].

          (c)  Change of Lending Office. Each Bank agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to increased costs or other special payments
under Section 3.04(b) [Illegality, Etc.] or Section 4.06(a) [Increased Costs,
Etc.] with respect to such Bank, it will if requested by the Company, use
reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Bank) to
designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event, provided
that such designation is made on terms that such Bank and its lending office
suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of
avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such
Section. Nothing in this Section 4.04(c) shall affect or postpone any of the
Obligations or the rights of the Agent or any Bank provided in this

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

Agreement.

          Section 4.05 Reduction or Termination of Commitments. The aggregate
amount of the Commitments shall be automatically reduced to zero on the
Expiration Date. In addition, the Borrower shall have the right to terminate or
reduce the then unused portion of Commitments at any time or from time to time;
provided that (a) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of
$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (b) at no
time shall the total amount of the Commitments be less than current Loans
outstanding; and (c) any Borrower shall provide at least five (5) Business Days
prior written notice of each such termination or reduction to the Agent
specifying the amount of the Commitments to be reduced or terminated. Each such
notice shall be irrevocable, and Commitments once terminated or reduced may not
be reinstated.

          Section 4.06 Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances. (a)
Increased Costs or Reduced Return Resulting From Taxes, Reserves, Capital
Adequacy Requirements, Expenses, Etc. If any Law, guideline or interpretation or
any change in any Law, guideline or interpretation or application thereof by any
Official Body charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or
compliance with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
Law) of any central bank or other Official Body:

          (i)   subjects any Bank to any tax or changes the basis of taxation
     with respect to this Agreement, the Committed Loans or the Bid Loans or
     payments by any Borrower of principal, interest, Facility Fees, Term Loan
     Fees or other amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder (except for taxes on
     the overall net income of such Bank),

          (ii)  imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve (including the
     Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit or similar requirement
     against credits or commitments to extend credit extended by, or assets
     (funded or contingent) of, deposits with or for the account of, or other
     acquisitions of funds by, any Bank, or

          (iii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any capital adequacy or
     similar requirement (A) against assets (funded or contingent) of, or
     letters of credit, other credits or commitments to extend credit extended
     by, any Bank, or (B) otherwise applicable to the obligations of any Bank
     under this Agreement,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to, reduce the
income receivable by, or impose any expense (including loss of margin) upon any
Bank with respect to this Agreement, or the making, maintenance or funding of
any part of the Committed Loans or the Bid Loans (or, in the case of any capital
adequacy or similar requirement, to have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on any Bank's capital, taking into consideration such Bank's customary
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount which such Bank in its
sole discretion deems to be material, such Bank shall from time to time notify
the Borrowers and the Agent of the amount determined in good faith (using any
averaging and attribution methods employed in good faith) by such Bank to be
necessary to compensate such Bank for such increase in cost, reduction of
income, additional expense or reduced rate of return. Such notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination. Such amount shall
be due

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

and payable by the applicable Borrower to such Bank ten (10) Business
Days after such notice is given.

          (b)  Indemnity. In addition to the compensation required by Section
4.06 [Increased Costs, Etc.], the each Borrower shall indemnify each Bank
against all liabilities, losses, or expenses (including loss of margin, any loss
or expense incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties and
any loss or expense incurred in connection with funds acquired by a Bank to fund
or maintain Loans subject to a LIBOR Option or the Bid Loan Fixed Rate Option)
which such Bank sustains or incurs as a consequence of any

          (i)   payment, prepayment, conversion, or renewal of any Loan to which
     a LIBOR Option or the Bid Loan Fixed Rate Option applies on a day other
     than the last day of the corresponding Interest Period (whether or not such
     payment or prepayment is mandatory, voluntary, or automatic and whether or
     not such payment or prepayment is then due),

          (ii)  attempt by such Borrower to revoke (expressly, by later
     inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Requests under
     Section 2.05 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests], Section 2.08 [Bid Loan
     Facility] or Section 3.02 [Interest Periods] or notice relating to
     prepayments under Section 4.04 [Voluntary Prepayments], or

          (iii) default by such Borrower in the performance or observance of any
     covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Loan
     Document, including any failure of such Borrower to pay when due (by
     acceleration or otherwise) any principal of or interest on the Committed
     Loans or the Bid Loans, Facility Fee, Term Loan Fee or any other amount due
     hereunder; or

          (iv)  payment or prepayment of any Bid Loan on a day other than the
     maturity date thereof (whether or not such payment or prepayment is
     mandatory or voluntary).

          If any Bank sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it shall from
time to time notify the respective Borrower of the amount determined in good
faith by such Bank (which determination may include such assumptions,
allocations of costs and expenses, and averaging or attribution methods as such
Bank shall deem reasonable) to be necessary to indemnify such Bank for such loss
or expense. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the respective Borrower
to such Bank ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.

          Section 4.07 Taxes. (a) No Deductions. All payments made by each
Borrower hereunder and under each Note shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding
taxes imposed on the net income of any Bank and all income and franchise taxes
applicable to any Bank of the United States (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required by Law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
Note, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

additional sums payable under this Section 4.07(a)) each Bank receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)
the applicable Borrower shall make such deductions, and (iii) the applicable
Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant tax authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable Law.

          (b)  Stamp Taxes. In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any
present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges, or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or
from the execution, delivery, or registration of, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement or any Note (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

          (c)  Indemnification for Taxes Paid by a Bank. Each Borrower shall
indemnify each Bank for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,
without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 4.07(c)) paid by any Bank and any liability
(including penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date a Bank
makes written demand therefor.

          (d)  Certificate. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of any
Taxes by any Borrower, the applicable Borrower shall furnish to each Bank, at
its address referred to herein, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof.

          (e)  Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrowers contained in this Section 4.07 shall survive the payment in full of
principal and interest hereunder and under any instrument delivered hereunder.

          Section 4.08 Judgment Currency. (a) Currency Conversion Procedures for
Judgments. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under a Note in any currency (the
"Original Currency") into another currency (the "Other Currency"), the parties
hereby agree, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that the rate of exchange
used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures each
Bank could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency after any
premium and costs of exchange on the Business Day preceding that on which final
judgment is given.

          (b)  Indemnity in Certain Events. The obligation of each Borrower in
respect of any sum due from such Borrower to any Bank hereunder shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in an Other Currency, whether pursuant to a
judgment or otherwise, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business
Day following receipt by any Bank of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Other
Currency, such Bank may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase
the Original Currency with such Other Currency. If the amount of the Original
Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Bank in the
Original Currency, each Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment or payment, to indemnify such Bank against
such loss.

          Section 4.09 Notes, Maturity. The Revolving Credit Loans and Term
Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced by a Revolving Credit/Term Loan Note
in the form of Exhibit 1.01(R). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement, (x) all outstanding Revolving Credit
Loans not converted to Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(b) shall be repaid in
full on the Expiration Date and (y) all outstanding Term Loans shall be repaid
on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

          Section 4.10 Mandatory Prepayments. (a) If on any date the sum of the
aggregate outstanding Principal Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and Bid Loans
(all the foregoing, collectively, the "Aggregate Loan Outstandings") exceeds the
Commitments as then in effect, the Borrowers shall repay no later than the next
following Business Day the principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans in an
aggregate Principal Amount equal to such excess. If, after giving effect to the
prepayment of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans as set forth above, the
remaining Aggregate Loan Outstandings exceed the Commitments, the Borrowers
shall repay on such date the principal of Bid Loans in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess.

          (b)  If on any date on which Dollar Equivalents are determined,
pursuant to Section 1.03(b), the sum of the aggregate outstanding Principal
Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and Bid Loans constituting Alternate Currency
Loans exceeds $12,500,000, the UK Borrower shall repay no later than the next
following Business Day the principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans
constituting Alternate Currency Loans in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to
such excess. If, after giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding
Revolving Credit Loans constituting Alternate Currency Loans as set forth above,
the aggregate outstanding Principal Amount of Bid Loans constituting Alternate
Currency Loans exceeds $12,500,000, the UK Borrower shall repay on such date Bid
Loans constituting Alternate Currency Loans in an aggregate Principal Amount
equal to such excess.

          (c)  If on any date the aggregate Principal Amount of Revolving Credit

                         ------------------------------

and warrants to the Agent and each of the Banks as follows:

          (a)  Organization and Qualification. Such Borrower is a corporation
     duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of
     its jurisdiction of organization. Such Borrower has the lawful power to own

     in each jurisdiction where the property owned or leased by it or the

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

     nature of the business transacted by it or both makes such licensing or
     qualification necessary.

          (b)  Capitalization and Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, the UK
     Borrower and ACE Risk Assurance Company, a Maryland corporation, are the
     sole Subsidiaries of the Company. ACE Risk Assurance Company is an inactive
     corporation having no material liabilities or Indebtedness. The authorized
     capital stock of the Company is owned by ACE Financial Services, Inc., a
     Delaware corporation, and all such shares of stock have been validly issued
     and are fully paid and nonassessable.

          (c)  Power and Authority. Such Borrower has full power to enter into,
     execute, deliver, and carry out this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
     to which it is a party, to incur the Indebtedness contemplated by the Loan
     Documents, and to perform its Obligations under the Loan Documents to which
     it is a party, and all such actions have been duly authorized by all
     necessary proceedings on its part.

          (d)  Validity and Binding Effect. This Agreement has been duly and
     validly executed and delivered by such Borrower, and each other Loan
     Document which such Borrower is required to execute and deliver as of the
     date hereof has been duly executed and delivered by such Borrower. Assuming
     the due execution and delivery by Agent and the Banks of those Loan
     Documents to which they are a party, this Agreement and each other Loan
     Document to which such Borrower is a party constitute the legal, valid and
     binding obligations of such Borrower on and after its date of delivery
     thereof, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms,
     except to the extent that enforceability of any of such Loan Document may
     be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other
     similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally or
     limiting the right of specific performance.

          (e)  No Conflict. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
     or the other Loan Documents by such Borrower nor the consummation of the
     transactions herein or therein contemplated or compliance with the terms
     and provisions hereof or thereof will conflict with, constitute a default
     under or result in any breach of (i) the terms and conditions of the
     certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other organizational
     documents of such Borrower, or (ii) any Law or any material agreement or
     instrument or order, writ, judgment, injunction, or decree to which such
     Borrower is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or

     whatsoever upon any property (now or hereafter acquired) of such Borrower
     (other than Permitted Liens).

     investigations pending or, to the knowledge of such Borrower, threatened
     against such Borrower at law or in equity before any Official Body which
     individually or in the aggregate may result in any Material Adverse Change.
     Such Borrower is not in violation of any order, writ, injunction, or any
     decree of any Official Body which may result in any Material Adverse
     Change.

     to or valid leasehold interests in all properties, assets, and other rights
     which it purports to own or lease or which are reflected as owned or leased

               (A)   Historical Statements. The Company has delivered to the

          for and as of the end of the three (3) fiscal years ended December 31,
          2000, 2001 and 2002 (the "Historical Statements"). The Historical
          Statements were compiled from the books and records maintained by the
          Company's management, are correct and complete and fairly represent

               (B)   Accuracy of Financial Statements. As of the Closing Date,
          neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any
          liabilities, contingent or otherwise, or forward or long-term
          commitments or Off-Balance Sheet Transactions that are not disclosed
          in the Historical Statements or in the notes thereto, and except as
          disclosed therein there are no unrealized or anticipated losses from
          any commitments of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company which
          may cause a Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2002, no
          Material Adverse Change has occurred.

               (C)   Reinsurance Coverage. The Company has delivered Schedule

          to the Company of reinsurance and the extent of the Company's
          insurance or reinsurance exposure covered thereby; as of December 31,
          2002, Schedule 5.01(h) is correct and complete and fairly represents

     its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
     purpose, immediately, incidentally or ultimately, of purchasing or carrying
     margin stock (such term used herein within the meaning of Regulation U). No
     part of the proceeds of any Loan has been or will be used, immediately,
     incidentally or ultimately, to purchase or carry any margin stock or to
     extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
     margin stock or to refund Indebtedness originally incurred for such
     purpose, or for any purpose which entails a violation of or which is
     inconsistent with the provisions of the regulations of the Board of
     Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Such Borrower does not hold or

                                      -37-

     intend to hold margin stock in such amounts that more than 25% of the
     reasonable value of its assets are or will be represented by margin stock.

          (j)  Full Disclosure. Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan
     Document, nor any certificate, statement, agreement, or other document
     furnished to the Agent or any Bank by such Borrower in connection herewith
     or therewith, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
     state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
     herein and therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
     made, not misleading. There is no fact known to such Borrower which
     materially adversely affects the business, property, assets, financial
     condition, results of operations, or prospects of such Borrower which has
     not been set forth in this Agreement or in the certificates, statements,

     due pursuant to said returns or to assessments received, except to the
     extent that such taxes, fees, assessments, and other charges are being
     contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and
     for which such reserves or other appropriate provisions, if any, as shall
     be required by GAAP shall have been made. There are no agreements or
     waivers extending the statutory period of limitations applicable to any
     federal income tax return of such Borrower for any period.

     occurred and is continuing and no condition exists or will exist after
     giving effect to the borrowings or other extensions of credit to be made on
     the Closing Date under or pursuant to the Loan Documents which constitutes
     an Event of Default or Potential Default. Such Borrower is not in violation
     of (i) any term of its certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws, or
     other organizational documents or (ii) any material agreement or instrument

     respective terms, and there is no default thereunder, to such Borrower's
     knowledge, with respect to parties other than such Borrower. Such Borrower
     is not bound by any contractual obligation, or subject to any restriction

     including all taxes, assessments, and governmental charges upon it or any
     of its properties, assets, income or profits, prior to the date on which
     penalties attach thereto, except to the extent that such liabilities,
     including taxes, assessments or charges, are being contested in good faith
     and by appropriate and lawful proceedings diligently conducted and for
     which such reserve or other appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be
     required by GAAP shall have been made, provided that the Company will pay,
     and cause its Material Subsidiaries to pay, all such liabilities forthwith
     upon the commencement of proceedings to foreclose any Lien which may have

     extent applicable to the respective industry of the Company or any
     Subsidiary thereof, fire, extended coverage, property damage, workers'
     compensation, public liability, and business interruption insurance) and
     against other risks (including errors and omissions) in such amounts as
     similar properties and assets are insured by prudent companies in similar

     financially sound insurers, including self-insurance to the extent
     customary.

          (d)  Maintenance of Properties and Leases. The Company shall, and

     all appropriate repairs, renewals, or replacements thereof.

          (e)  Maintenance of Licenses, Etc. The Company shall, and shall cause
     each of its Material Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect all
     licenses, franchises, permits, rights, and other authorizations necessary
     for the ownership and operation of its properties and business if the
     failure so to maintain the same would constitute a Material Adverse Change.

          (f)  Visitation Rights. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
     Material Subsidiaries to, permit any of the officers or authorized
     employees or representatives of the Agent to visit and inspect any of its

     in such detail and at such times and as often as the Agent may reasonably
     request and at the pro rata expense of the Banks (if requested by the
     Required Banks) or the Agent (if not so requested), provided that the Agent
     shall provide the Company with reasonable notice prior to any visit or
     inspection and provided further that during the continuation of any Event
     of Default, each Bank shall have the right of visitation and inspection
     granted above to Agent and all such visits and inspections by Agent and any
     Bank during the continuation of an Event of Default shall be at the expense
     of the Borrowers. In the event any Bank desires to conduct a visitation or
     inspection of the Company or any Subsidiary during the continuation of an
     Event of Default, such Bank shall make a reasonable effort to conduct such
     visitation and inspection contemporaneously with any visitation or
     inspection to be performed by the Agent.

          (g)  Keeping of Records and Books of Account. The Company shall, and
     shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company to, maintain and keep proper

     Subsidiaries to issue financial statements in accordance with GAAP and as
     otherwise required by applicable Laws of any Official Body having
     jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and in
     which full, true and correct entries shall be made in all material respects
     of all its dealings and business and financial affairs.

<PAGE>

     Code and other Laws applicable to Plans and Benefit Arrangements except
     where such failure, alone or in conjunction with any other failure, would
     not result in a Material Adverse Change. Without limiting the generality of
     the foregoing, the Company shall cause all of its Plans and all Plans
     maintained by any member of the ERISA Group to be funded in accordance with
     the minimum funding requirements of ERISA and shall make, and cause each
     member of the ERISA Group to make, in a timely manner, all contributions

          (i)  Compliance With Laws. The Company shall, and shall cause each of
     its Material Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable Laws in all
     respects, provided that it shall not be deemed to be a violation of this
     Section 7.01(i) if any failure to comply with any Law would not result in
     fines, penalties, remediation costs, other similar liabilities or
     injunctive relief which in the aggregate would constitute a Material
     Adverse Change.

          (j)  Use of Proceeds. Each Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans
     only for the general corporate purposes and working capital needs of the
     such Borrower. No Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loans for any
     purposes which contravenes any applicable Law or any provision hereof.

          (k)  Senior Debt Status. The Company shall ensure that the Obligations
     of the Company and any Material Subsidiary under this Agreement, a
     Guarantor Joinder, the Guaranty Agreement, and each of the other Loan
     Documents to which it is a party shall at all times rank at least pari
     passu in priority of payment with all other senior unsecured Indebtedness
     of the Company or such Material Subsidiary (except to the extent of any
     Indebtedness which has a "preferred" status under any Law governing the
     bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency, rehabilitation, reorganization,
     conservation, or like circumstance of the Company or such Material
     Subsidiary) and no such other senior unsecured Indebtedness of the Company
     or any Material Subsidiary shall at any time be governed by or subject to
     covenants, defaults, or other provisions that are more restrictive on the
     Company or any Material Subsidiary than those set forth herein; and
     provided that if payment of any present or future Indebtedness of the
     Company or any Material Subsidiary, except Indebtedness of the Company or
     any Material Subsidiary to the extent secured by Permitted Liens, shall at
     any time hereafter become secured by any Lien on any property, the Company
     or such Material Subsidiary shall secure payment of the Obligations with a
     Lien of like priority on the same or substantially similar property of the
     same or greater value (but, in any event, such Lien shall secure an amount
     of Obligations not to exceed the amount secured by the Lien given to secure
     payment of such other Indebtedness).

          Section 7.02 Negative Covenants. Each Borrower covenants and agrees
that until payment in full of the Loans and interest thereon, satisfaction of
all of the other Obligations hereunder and termination of the Commitments, such
Borrower shall comply with the following negative covenants:

     borrower or guarantor in excess of $20,000,000 in the aggregate, and such

     any period of grace permitted with respect thereto, whether waived or not)

     Indebtedness (whether or not such right shall have been waived) or the
     termination of any commitment to lend;

          (f)  Final Judgments or Orders. Any final judgments or orders for the

     thereof or shall in any way be terminated (except in accordance with its
     terms) or become or be declared stayed, ineffective, or inoperative or

     the Company shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable

further obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans, Term Loans or Bid Loans, as
the case may be, and if any such Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
the Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Banks, shall by written
notice to the Borrowers, take any of the following actions: (i) terminate the
Commitments and thereupon the Commitments shall be terminated and of no further
force or effect, or (ii) declare the unpaid principal amount of the Revolving
Credit Notes, Term Loans and Bid Notes then outstanding and all interest accrued
thereon, any unpaid fees, and all other Indebtedness of the Borrowers to the
Banks hereunder and thereunder to be forthwith due and payable, and the same
shall thereupon become and be immediately due and payable to the Agent for the
benefit of each Bank without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived; and

          (b)  Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Reorganization Proceedings. If an Event
of Default specified under Section 8.01(m) [Involuntary Proceedings] or Section

terminate and be of no further force and effect, the Banks shall be under no
further obligations to make Revolving Credit Loans, Term Loans or Bid Loans
hereunder and the unpaid principal amount of the Loans then outstanding and all
interest accrued thereon, any unpaid fees and all other Indebtedness of the
Borrowers to the Banks hereunder and thereunder shall be immediately due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of

          (c)  Set-off. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
any Bank to whom any Obligation is owed by any Borrower or any Material
Subsidiary hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any participant of such
Bank which has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of Section 9.13
[Equalization of Banks] and any branch, Subsidiary, or Affiliate of such Bank or
participant anywhere shall have the right, in addition to all other rights and
remedies available to it, without notice to any Borrower or any Material
Subsidiary, to set-off against and apply to the then unpaid balance of all the
Loans and all other Obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document any
debt owing to, and any other funds held in any manner for the account of, any
Borrower or any Material Subsidiary by such Bank or participant or by such
branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate, including all funds in all deposit accounts
(whether time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally
credited, or otherwise) now or hereafter maintained by any Borrower or any
Material Subsidiary for its own account (but not

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

including funds held in custodian or trust accounts) with such Bank or
participant or such branch, Subsidiary, or Affiliate. Such right shall exist
whether or not any Bank or the Agent shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether or not such debt owing to or funds
held for the account of any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary is or are
matured or unmatured and regardless of the existence or adequacy of any Guaranty
or any other security, right, or remedy available to any Bank or the Agent; and

          (d)  Suits, Actions, Proceedings. If an Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing, and whether or not the Agent shall have accelerated the
maturity of Committed Loans pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 8.02, the Agent or any Bank, upon the request or consent of the Required
Banks, may proceed to protect and enforce the Agent's or any one or more Banks'
rights by suit in equity, action at law and/or other appropriate proceeding,
whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, including as permitted by applicable
Law the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount
shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the
payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of the Agent or such Bank;
and

          (e)  Application of Proceeds. From and after the date on which the
Agent has taken any action pursuant to this Section 8.02 and until all
Obligations have been paid in full, any and all proceeds received by the Agent
from the exercise of any remedy by the Agent, shall be applied as follows:

          (A)  first, to reimburse the Agent and the Banks for out-of-pocket
     costs, expenses and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
     legal expenses, incurred by the Agent or the Banks in connection with
     collection of any Obligations under any of the Loan Documents;

          (B)  second, to the repayment of all Indebtedness then due and unpaid
     of any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary to the Banks incurred under this
     Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, whether of principal,
     interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, in such manner as the Agent may
     determine in its discretion; and

          (C)  the balance, if any, as required by Law.

          (f)  Other Rights and Remedies. In addition to all of the rights and
remedies contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, the
Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies under applicable Law, all of
which rights and remedies shall be cumulative and non-exclusive, to the extent
permitted by Law. The Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Banks
shall, exercise all post-default rights granted to the Agent and the Banks under
the Loan Documents or applicable Law.

          Section 8.03 Right of Competitive Bid Loan Banks. If any Event of
Default shall occur and be continuing, the Banks which have any Bid Loans then
outstanding to the Borrowers (the "Bid Loan Banks") shall not be entitled to
accelerate payment of the Bid Loans or to exercise any right or remedy related
to the collection of the Bid Loans until the Commitments shall be terminated
hereunder pursuant to Section 8.02. Upon such a termination of the

                                      -57-

<PAGE>

Commitments: (i) references to Revolving Credit Loans in Section 8.02 shall be
deemed to apply also to the Bid Loans and the Bid Loan Banks shall be entitled
to all enforcement rights given to a holder of a Revolving Credit Loan in
Section 8.02, and (ii) the definition of Required Banks shall be changed as
provided in Section 1.01 so that each Bank shall have voting rights hereunder in
proportion to its share of the total Loans outstanding.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                    THE AGENT
                                    ---------

          Section 9.01 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates,
appoints and authorizes ABN AMRO Bank N.V. to act as Agent for such Bank under
this Agreement and to execute and deliver or accept on behalf of each of the
Banks the other Loan Documents. Each Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred
to herein, and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder as
are specifically delegated to or required of the Agent by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. ABN AMRO Bank
N.V. agrees to act as the Agent on behalf of the Banks to the extent provided in
this Agreement.

          Section 9.02 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may perform any of its
duties hereunder by or through agents or employees (provided such delegation
does not constitute a relinquishment of its duties as Agent) and, subject to
Section 9.05 [Reimbursement of Agent by Borrower, Etc.] and Section 9.06, shall
be entitled to engage and pay for the advice or services of any attorneys,
accountants or other experts concerning all matters pertaining to its duties
hereunder and to rely upon any advice so obtained.

          Section 9.03 Nature of Duties; Independent Credit Investigation. The
Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth
in this Agreement and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations, or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise
exist. The duties of the Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature;
the Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary or trust
relationship in respect of any Bank; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to or shall be construed as to impose upon the Agent any
obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term "agent" in
this Agreement with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any
fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties. Each Bank expressly
acknowledges (i) that the Agent has not made any representations or warranties
to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank; (ii) that it
has made and will continue to make, without reliance upon the Agent, its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs and its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with this Agreement and the making and continuance of the Loans

                                      -58-

<PAGE>

hereunder; and (iii) except as expressly provided herein, that the Agent shall
have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information with respect thereto,
whether coming into its possession before the making of any Loan or at any time
or times thereafter.

          Section 9.04 Actions in Discretion of Agent; Instructions From the
Banks. The Agent agrees, upon the written request of the Required Banks, to take
or refrain from taking any action of the type specified as being within the
Agent's rights, powers or discretion herein, provided that the Agent shall not
be required to take any action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or
which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable
Law. In the absence of a request by the Required Banks, the Agent shall have
authority, in its sole discretion, to take or not to take any such action,
unless this Agreement specifically requires the consent of the Required Banks or
all of the Banks. Any action taken or failure to act pursuant to such
instructions or discretion shall be binding on the Banks, subject to Section
9.06 [Exculpatory Provisions, Etc.]. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.06,
no Bank shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Agent as a result
of the Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the
instructions of the Required Banks, or in the absence of such instructions, in
the absolute discretion of the Agent.

          Section 9.05 Reimbursement and Indemnification of Agent by the
Borrowers. Each Borrower unconditionally, jointly and severally, agrees to pay
or reimburse the Agent and hold the Agent harmless against (a) liability for the
payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses, and disbursements
(including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent (i) in connection
with the development, negotiation, preparation, printing, execution,
administration, syndication, interpretation and performance of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, (ii) relating to any requested amendments, waivers
or consents pursuant to the provisions hereof, (iii) in connection with the
enforcement of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or collection of
amounts due hereunder or thereunder or the proof and allowability of any claim
arising under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether in bankruptcy
or receivership proceedings or otherwise, and (iv) in any workout or
restructuring or in connection with the protection, preservation, exercise or
enforcement of any of the terms hereof or of any rights hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in connection with any foreclosure, collection or
bankruptcy proceedings, and (b) all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent, in its capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted
by the Agent hereunder or thereunder, provided that the Borrowers shall not be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements if the
same results from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or if the
Borrowers were not given notice of the subject claim and the opportunity to
participate in the defense thereof, at their expense (except that the Borrowers
shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does not result in
a loss to the Borrowers), or if the same results from a compromise or settlement
agreement entered into without the consent of the Borrowers, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

          Section 9.06 Exculpatory Provisions; Limitation of Liability. Neither
the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or
Affiliates shall (a) be liable to

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

any Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder, or
in connection herewith including pursuant to any Loan Document, unless caused by
its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) be responsible in
any manner to any of the Banks for the effectiveness, enforceability,
genuineness, validity or the due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents or for any recital, representation, warranty, document, certificate,
report or statement herein or made or furnished under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Documents, or (c) be under any obligation to any of
the Banks to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any
of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof or thereof on the part of the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, or the financial condition of the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, or the existence or possible existence
of any Event of Default or Potential Default. No claim may be made by the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, any Bank, the Agent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries against the Agent, any Bank or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates, or any of them,
for any special, indirect or consequential damages or, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, for any punitive damages in respect of any claim or cause of
action (whether based on contract, tort, statutory liability, or any other
ground) based on, arising out of or related to any Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any act, omission or event occurring in
connection therewith, including the negotiation, documentation, administration
or collection of the Loans, and the Borrowers (for themselves and on behalf of
each of their Subsidiaries), the Agent and each Bank hereby waive, release and
agree never to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether such claim now
exists or hereafter arises and whether or not it is now known or suspected to
exist in their favor. Each Bank agrees that, except for notices, reports and
other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent
hereunder or given to the Agent for the account of or with copies for the Banks,
the Agent and each of its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or
Affiliates shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with an
credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property,
condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the
Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or
Affiliates.

          Section 9.07 Reimbursement and Indemnification of Agent by Banks. Each
Bank agrees to reimburse and indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrowers and without limiting the Obligation of the Borrowers to do so)
in proportion to its Ratable Share from and against all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements, including attorneys' fees and disbursements
(including the allocated costs of staff counsel), and costs of appraisers and
environmental consultants, of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent, in its capacity as such, in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or
any action taken or omitted by the Agent hereunder or thereunder, provided that
no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements (a) if the same results from the Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct, or (b) if such Bank was not given notice of the subject
claim and the opportunity to participate in the defense thereof, at its expense
(except that such Bank shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give
notice does not result in a loss to the Bank), or (c) if the same results from a
compromise and settlement agreement entered into without the consent of such
Bank, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, each Bank agrees
promptly upon demand to reimburse the Agent (to the

                                      -60-

<PAGE>

extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the Obligation of
the Borrowers to do so) in proportion to its Ratable Share for all amounts due
and payable by the Borrowers to the Agent in connection with the Agent's
periodic audit of the Company's or any of its respective Material Subsidiaries'
books, records and business properties.

          Section 9.08 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any writing, telegram, telex or teletype message, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, letter, cablegram, statement, order or other document or
conversation by telephone or otherwise believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon
the advice and opinions of counsel and other professional advisers selected by
the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action hereunder unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

          Section 9.09 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Potential Default or Event of
Default unless the Agent has received written notice from a Bank or a Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Potential Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default."

          Section 9.10 Notices. The Agent shall promptly send to each Bank a
copy of all notices received from any Borrower pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents promptly upon receipt thereof. The
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the other Banks of each change in
the Base Rate and the effective date thereof.

          Section 9.11 Banks in Their Individual Capacities; Agents in Its
Individual Capacity. With respect to its Revolving Credit Commitment, the
Revolving Credit Loans and any Bid Loans made by it and any other rights and
powers given to it as a Bank hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents,
the Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Bank" and
"Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its
individual capacity. ABN AMRO Bank and its Affiliates and each of the Banks and
their respective Affiliates may, without liability to account, except as
prohibited herein, make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of,
acquire equity interests in, accept deposits from, discount drafts for, act as
trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, in the case of the Agent, as though it were
not acting as Agent hereunder and in the case of each Bank, as though such Bank
were not a Bank hereunder, in each case without notice to or consent of the
other Banks. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Agent
or its Affiliates may (i) receive information regarding the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to
provide such information to them, and (ii) accept fees and other consideration
from the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for services in connection with
this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Banks.

          Section 9.12 Holders of Notes. The Agent may deem and treat any payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until
written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with
the Agent. Any request, authority or consent of any Person who at the time of
making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any
Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or
assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

          Section 9.13 Equalization of Banks. The Banks and the holders of any
participations in any Commitments or Loans or other rights or obligations of a
Bank hereunder agree among themselves that, with respect to all amounts received
by any Bank or any such holder for application on any Obligation hereunder or
under any such participation, whether received by voluntary payment, by
realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's
lien, by counterclaim, or by any other non-pro rata source, equitable adjustment
will be made in the manner stated in the following sentence so that, in effect,
all such excess amounts will be shared ratably among the Banks and such holders
in proportion to their interests in payments on the Loans, except as otherwise
provided in Section 3.04(c) [Agent's and Bank's Rights], Section 4.04(b)
[Replacement of a Bank] or Section 4.06 [Additional Compensation in Certain
Circumstances]. The Banks or any such holder receiving any such amount shall
purchase for cash from each of the other Banks an interest in such Bank's Loans
in such amount as shall result in a ratable participation by the Banks and each
such holder in the aggregate unpaid amount of the Loans, provided that if all or
any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from the Bank or the
holder making such purchase, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other
amounts, if any, required by law (including court order) to be paid by the Bank
or the holder making such purchase.

          Section 9.14 Successor Agent. The Agent (i) may resign as Agent or
(ii) shall resign if such resignation is required by Section 4.04(b)
[Replacement of a Bank], in either case of (i) or (ii) by giving not less than
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Borrowers. If the Agent shall
resign under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required Banks shall appoint
from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, subject to the consent of
the Borrowers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or (b) if a
successor agent shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30)
day period following the Agent's notice to the Banks of its resignation, then
the Agent shall appoint, with the consent of the Borrowers, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, a successor agent who shall serve as Agent until such
time as the Required Banks appoint and the Borrowers consent to the appointment
of a successor agent. Upon its appointment pursuant to either clause (a) or (b)
above, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent, effective upon
its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall
be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After the resignation of
any Agent hereunder, the provisions of this ARTICLE IX shall inure to the
benefit of such former Agent and such former Agent shall not by reason of such
resignation be deemed to be released from liability for any actions taken or not
taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement.

          Section 9.15 Agent's Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent a
nonrefundable fee (the "Bid Loan Processing Fee") in connection with processing
Bid Loans and a

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

nonrefundable fee (the "Agent's Fee") for Agent's services hereunder under the
terms of a letter (the "Agent's Letter") between the Borrowers and Agent, as
amended from time to time.

          Section 9.16 Availability of Funds. The Agent may assume that each
Bank has made or will make the proceeds of a Loan available to the Agent unless
the Agent shall have been notified by such Bank on or before the later of (1)
the close of Business on the Business Day preceding the Borrowing Date with
respect to such Loan or (2) two hours before the time on which the Agent
actually funds the proceeds of such Loan to the respective Borrower (whether
using its own funds pursuant to this Section 9.16 or using proceeds deposited
with the Agent by the Banks and whether such funding occurs before or after the
time on which Banks are required to deposit the proceeds of such Loan with the
Agent). The Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be
required to), make available to the respective Borrower a corresponding amount.
If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Agent by such
Bank, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such
Bank (or, if such Bank fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand from
the Borrowers) together with interest thereon, in respect of each day during the
period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Borrowers
and ending on the date the Agent recovers such amount, at a rate per annum equal
to (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three (3) days after
such interest shall begin to accrue and (ii) the applicable interest rate in
respect of such Loan after the end of such three-day period.

          Section 9.17 Calculations. In the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct, the Agent shall not be liable for any error in computing the
amount payable to any Bank whether in respect of the Loans, fees or any other
amounts due to the Banks under this Agreement. In the event an error in
computing any amount payable to any Bank is made, the Agent, the Borrowers and
each affected Bank shall, forthwith upon discovery of such error, make such
adjustments as shall be required to correct such error, and any compensation
therefor will be calculated at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

          Section 9.18 Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided herein, the
provisions of this ARTICLE IX are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the
Banks, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not have any rights to rely on
or enforce any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties
under this Agreement, the Agent shall act solely as agent of the Banks and does
not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or
relationship of agency or trust with or for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS
                                  -------------

          Section 10.01 Modifications, Amendments, or Waivers. With the written
consent of the Required Banks, the Agent, acting on behalf of all the Banks, and
the Borrowers may from time to time enter into written agreements amending or
changing any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
rights of the Banks or the Borrowers hereunder or thereunder, or may grant
written waivers or consents to a departure from the due performance of the
Obligations hereunder or thereunder. Any such agreement, waiver or consent made
with

                                      -63-

<PAGE>

such written consent shall be effective to bind all the Banks and the Borrowers;
provided that, without the written consent of all the Banks, no such agreement,
waiver, or consent may be made which will:

          (a)  Increase of Commitment; Extension of Expiration Date. Increase
     the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Bank hereunder or
     extend the Expiration Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date;

          (b)  Extension of Payment; Reduction of Principal Interest or Fees;
     Modification of Terms of Payment. Whether or not any Loans are outstanding,
     extend the time for payment of principal or interest of any Loan (excluding
     the due date of any mandatory prepayment of a Loan or any mandatory
     Commitment reduction in connection with such a mandatory prepayment
     hereunder except for mandatory reductions of the Commitments on the
     Expiration Date), the Facility Fee, the Term Loan Fee or any other fee
     payable to any Bank, or reduce the principal amount of or the rate of
     interest borne by any Loan or reduce the Facility Fee or any other fee
     payable to any Bank, or otherwise affect the terms of payment of the
     principal of or interest of any Loan, the Facility Fee or any other fee
     payable to any Bank;

          (c)  Release of Collateral or Guarantor. Release any Guarantor from
     its Obligations under the Guaranty Agreement or any other security for any
     of the Obligations except as otherwise may be permitted by the terms hereof
     or of the instrument establishing the Lien; or

          (d)  Miscellaneous. Amend Section 4.02 [Pro Rata Treatment of Banks],
     Section 9.06 [Exculpatory Provisions, Etc.] or Section 9.13 [Equalization
     of Banks] or this Section 10.01, alter any provision regarding the pro rata
     treatment of the Banks, change the definition of Required Banks, or change
     any requirement providing for the Banks or the Required Banks to authorize
     the taking of any action hereunder;

provided, further, that no agreement, waiver or consent which would modify the
interests, rights or obligations of the Agent in its capacity as Agent or as an
issuer of letters of credit shall be effective without the written consent of
the Agent.

          Section 10.02 No Implied Waivers; Cumulative Remedies; Writing
Required. No course of dealing and no delay or failure of the Agent or any Bank
in exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall affect any other or future exercise thereof or operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right, power, remedy or
privilege preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other right, power,
remedy or privilege. The rights and remedies of the Agent and the Banks under
this Agreement and any other Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have. Any waiver, permit,
consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any Bank of any
breach or default under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision or
condition of this Agreement must be in writing and shall be effective only to
the extent specifically set forth in such writing.

          Section 10.03 Reimbursement and Indemnification of Banks by the
Borrower; Taxes. The Borrower agrees unconditionally upon demand to pay or
reimburse to each Bank (other than the Agent, as to which the Borrowers'
Obligations are set forth in Section 9.05 [Reimbursement of Agent By Borrower,
Etc.]) and to save such Bank harmless against (i) liability for the payment of
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements (including fees
and expenses of counsel for each Bank except with respect to (a) and (b) below),
incurred by such Bank (a) in connection with the review, execution, delivery,
administration, or interpretation of this Agreement, and other instruments and
documents to be delivered hereunder, (b) relating to any amendments, waivers, or
consents pursuant to the provisions hereof, (c) in connection with the
enforcement of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or collection of
amounts due hereunder or thereunder or the proof and allowability of any claim
arising under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether in bankruptcy
or receivership proceedings or otherwise, and (d) in any workout or
restructuring or in connection with the protection, preservation, exercise, or
enforcement of any of the terms hereof or of any rights hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in connection with any foreclosure, collection, or
bankruptcy proceedings, or (ii) all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against such Bank (including such Bank's officers, directors and employees), in
its capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any other Loan Documents, use of proceeds of the Loans or the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Bank
(including such Bank's officers, directors and employees) hereunder or
thereunder, provided that the Borrowers shall not be liable to a Bank (including
such Bank's officers, directors and employees) for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses, or disbursements (A) if the same results from such Bank's or
its officer's, director's or employee's gross negligence or willful misconduct,
or (B) if the Borrowers were not given notice of the subject claim and the
opportunity to participate in the defense thereof, at their expense (except that
the Borrowers shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does
not result in a loss to the Borrowers), or (C) if the same results from a
compromise or settlement agreement entered into without the consent of the
Borrowers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Banks will attempt to
minimize the fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Banks which are subject
to reimbursement by the Borrowers hereunder by considering the usage of one law
firm to represent the Banks and the Agent if appropriate under the
circumstances. The Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree unconditionally to
pay all stamp, document, transfer, recording or filing taxes or fees and similar
impositions now or hereafter determined by the Agent or any Bank to be payable
in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and the Borrowers,
jointly and severally, agree unconditionally to save the Agent and the Banks
harmless from and against any and all present or future claims, liabilities or
losses with respect to or resulting from any omission to pay or delay in paying
any such taxes, fees or impositions.

          Section 10.04 Holidays. Whenever payment of a Loan to be made or taken
hereunder shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day such payment shall
be due on the next Business Day (except as provided in the definition of
Committed Loan Interest Period with respect to Interest Periods under the LIBOR
Option) and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest and
fees, except that the Loans shall be due on the Business Day preceding the
Expiration Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date if the Expiration Date or the
Term Loan

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

Maturity Date is not a Business Day. Whenever any payment or action to be made
or taken hereunder (other than payment of the Loans) shall be stated to be due
on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment or action shall be made or
taken on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall not
be included in computing interest or fees, if any, in connection with such
payment or action.

          Section 10.05 Funding by Branch, Subsidiary, or Affiliate. (a)
Notional Funding. Each Bank shall have the right from time to time, without
notice to the Borrowers, to deem any branch, Subsidiary, or Affiliate (which for
the purposes of this Section 10.05 shall mean any corporation or association
which is directly or indirectly controlled by or is under direct or indirect
common control with any corporation or association which directly or indirectly
controls such Bank) of such Bank to have made, maintained, or funded any Loan to
which the LIBOR Option applies at any time, provided that immediately following
(on the assumption that a payment was then due from the Borrowers to such other
office), and as a result of such change, the Borrowers will not be under any
greater financial obligation pursuant to Section 4.06 [Additional Compensation
in Certain Circumstances] than they would have been in the absence of such
change. Notional funding offices may be selected by each Bank without regard to
such Bank's actual methods of making, maintaining or funding the Loans or any
sources of funding actually used by or available to such Bank.

          (b)  Actual Funding. Each Bank shall have the right from time to time
to make or maintain any Loan by arranging for a branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate
of such Bank to make or maintain such Loan subject to the last sentence of this
Section 10.05(b). If any Bank causes a branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to make
or maintain any part of the Loans hereunder, all terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall, except where the context clearly requires otherwise, be
applicable to such part of the Loans to the same extent as if such Loans were
made or maintained by such Bank, but in no event shall any Bank's use of such a
branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to make or maintain any part of the Loans
hereunder cause such Bank or such branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to incur any
cost or expenses payable by any Borrower hereunder or require any Borrower to
pay any other compensation to any Bank (including any expenses incurred or
payable pursuant to Section 4.06 [Additional Compensation in Certain
Circumstances]) which would otherwise not be incurred.

          Section 10.06 Notices. Any notice, request, demand, direction, or
other communication (for purposes of this Section 10.06 only, a "Notice") to be
given to or made upon any party hereto under any provision of this Agreement
shall be given or made by telephone or in writing (which includes means of
electronic transmission (i.e., "e-mail") or facsimile transmission in accordance
with this Section 10.06. Any such Notice must be delivered to the applicable
parties hereto at the addresses and numbers set forth under their respective
names on Schedule 1.01(B) hereof or in accordance with any subsequent unrevoked
Notice from any such party that is given in accordance with this Section 10.06.
Any Notice shall be effective:

          (A)  In the case of hand-delivery, when delivered;

          (B)  If given by mail, four days after such Notice is deposited with
     the United States Postal Service, with first-class postage prepaid, return
     receipt requested;

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

          (C)  In the case of a telephonic Notice, when a party is contacted by
     telephone, if delivery of such telephonic Notice is confirmed no later than
     the next Business Day by hand delivery, a facsimile or electronic
     transmission, a Website Posting or overnight courier delivery of a
     confirmatory notice (received at or before noon on such next Business Day);

          (D)  In the case of a facsimile transmission, when sent to the
     applicable party's facsimile machine's telephone number if the party
     sending such Notice receives confirmation of the delivery thereof from its
     own facsimile machine;

          (E)  In the case of electronic transmission, when actually received;

          (F)  In the case of a Website Posting, upon delivery of a Notice of
     such posting (including the information necessary to access such web site)
     by another means set forth in this Section 10.06; and

          (G)  If given by any other means (including by overnight courier),
     when actually received.

Any Bank giving a Notice to any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary shall
concurrently send a copy thereof to the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly
notify the other Banks of its receipt of such Notice.

          Section 10.07 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are
intended to be severable. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity
or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or
enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions
hereof in any jurisdiction.

          Section 10.08 Governing Law. This Agreement and any other documents
delivered herewith and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto and
thereto shall be for all purposes governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to its conflicts of law principles.

          Section 10.09 Prior Understanding. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or
oral, between the parties hereto and thereto relating to the transactions
provided for herein and therein, including any prior confidentiality agreements
and commitments.

          Section 10.10 Duration; Survival. All representations and warranties
of the Borrowers and the Material Subsidiaries contained herein or made in
connection herewith shall survive the making of Loans and shall not be waived by
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation by the Agent or
the Banks, the making of Loans, or payment in full of the Loans. All covenants
and agreements of the Borrowers contained in Section 7.01 [Affirmative
Covenants], Section 7.02 [Negative Covenants] and Section 7.03 [Reporting
Requirements], and all comparable covenants and agreements contained in or
incorporated into the Guarantor Joinder given by each Material Subsidiary
pursuant to Section 10.18, shall

                                      -67-

continue in full force and effect from and after the date hereof so long as the
Borrowers may borrow hereunder and until termination of the Commitments and
payment in full of the Loans. All covenants and agreements of the Borrowers
contained herein relating to the payment of principal, interest, premiums,
additional compensation or expenses and indemnification, including those set
forth in ARTICLE IV [Payments] and Section 9.05 [Reimbursement of Agent by
Borrowers, Etc.], Section 9.07 [Reimbursement of Agent by Banks, Etc.] and
Section 10.03 [Reimbursement of Banks by Borrowers; Etc.], and all comparable
covenants and agreements contained in or incorporated into the Guarantor Joinder
given by each Material Subsidiary pursuant to Section 10.18, shall survive
payment in full of the Loans and termination of the Commitments.

          Section 10.11 Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Banks, the Agent, the
Borrowers and the Material Subsidiaries, and their respective successors and
assigns, except that no Borrowers or any Material Subsidiary may assign or
transfer any of its rights or Obligations or any interest herein or in any other
Loan Document, except as may be permitted by the terms hereof. Each Bank may, at
its own cost, make assignments of or sell participations in all or any part of
its Revolving Credit Commitments and the Loans made by it to one or more banks
or other entities, subject to the consent of the Borrowers and the Agent with
respect to any assignee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, provided
that (1) no consent of the Borrowers shall be required (A) if an Event of
Default exists and is continuing, or (B) in the case of an assignment by a Bank
to an Affiliate of such Bank, (2) any assignment by a Bank to a Person other
than an Affiliate of such Bank may not be made in amounts less than the lesser
of $5,000,000 or the amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment, (3) a Bank may
assign an interest or sell a participation in less than 100% of its Commitments,
Committed Loans, or Bid Loans, provided that such Bank sells an equal percentage
interest or participation in each of its Revolving Credit Commitment and
Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans, and (4) a Bank may assign a Bid Loan to
another Person without assigning any portion of its Commitment to such Person.
In the case of an assignment, upon receipt by the Agent of the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment
(unless otherwise provided therein), the same rights, benefits and obligations
as it would have if it had been a signatory Bank hereunder, the Commitments
shall be adjusted accordingly, and upon surrender of any Revolving Credit/Term
Loan Note subject to such assignment, the applicable Borrower shall execute and
deliver a new Revolving Credit/Term Loan Note to the assignee, if such assignee
requests such a Note in an amount equal to the amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitment assumed by it and a new Revolving Credit/Term Loan Note to the
assigning Bank, if the assigning Bank requests such a Note with respect to the
Commitment it has retained. The assigning Bank shall surrender its Bid Note and
the respective Borrower shall execute and deliver to the assignee (and to the
assignor if the assignor is assigning less than all of its Revolving Credit
Commitments and Bid Loans) a new Bid Note in the form of Exhibit 1.01(B) as
appropriate. Any Bank which assigns any or all of its Commitment or Loans to a
Person other than an Affiliate of such Bank shall pay to the Agent a service fee
in the amount of $3,500 for each assignment. In the case of a participation, the
participant shall only have the rights specified in Section 8.02 [Set-off] (the
participant's rights against such Bank in respect of such participation to be
those set forth in the agreement executed by such Bank in favor of the
participant relating thereto and not to include any voting rights except with
respect to changes of the type referenced in Section 10.01(a) [Increase of
Commitment, Etc.], Section 10.01(b) [Extension of Payment, Etc.], or Section

                                      -68-

<PAGE>

10.01(c) [Release of Collateral or Guarantor]), all of such Bank's obligations
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall remain unchanged, and all
amounts payable by any Borrower or any Material Subsidiary hereunder or
thereunder shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation.

          (b)  Any assignee or participant which is not incorporated under the
Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall deliver to the
Borrowers and the Agent the form of certificate described in Section 10.17 [Tax
Withholding Clause] relating to federal income tax withholding. Each Bank may
furnish any publicly available information concerning the Borrowers or its
Subsidiaries and any other information concerning the Borrowers or its
Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank from time to time to assignees and
participants (including prospective assignees or participants), provided that
such assignees and participants agree to be bound by the provisions of Section
10.12 [Confidentiality].

          (c)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Bank
may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement, its Note (if any) and the other Loan Documents to
any Federal Reserve Bank without notice to or consent of the Borrowers or the
Agent. No such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release the
transferor Bank of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

          Section 10.12 Confidentiality. (a) General. The Agent and the Banks
each agree to keep confidential all information obtained from the Borrowers or
their Subsidiaries which is nonpublic and confidential or proprietary in nature
(including any information the Borrowers specifically designate as
confidential), except as provided below, and to use such information only in
connection with their respective capacities under this Agreement and for the
purposes contemplated hereby. The Agent and the Banks shall be permitted to
disclose such information (i) to outside legal counsel, accountants and other
professional advisors who need to know such information in connection with the
administration and enforcement of this Agreement, subject to agreement of such
Persons to maintain the confidentiality of such information as provided herein,
(ii) to assignees and participants as contemplated by Section 10.11, and
prospective assignees and participants, provided that Agent exercises its best
efforts to obtain the agreement of such prospective assignees and participants
to be bound by the confidentiality provisions hereof, (iii) to the extent
requested by any bank regulatory authority or, with notice to the Borrowers, as
otherwise required by applicable Law or by any subpoena or similar legal
process, or in connection with any investigation or proceeding arising out of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) if it becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement or becomes
available from a source not known to be subject to confidentiality restrictions,
or (v) if the Borrowers shall have consented to such disclosure.

          (b)  Sharing Information With Affiliates of the Banks. The Borrowers
acknowledge that from time to time financial advisory, investment banking, and
other services may be offered or provided to the Borrowers or one or more of
their Affiliates (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by any Bank or
by one or more Subsidiaries or Affiliates of such Bank and the Borrowers hereby
authorize each Bank to share any information delivered to such Bank by the
Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in
connection with the decision of such Bank to enter into this Agreement, to any
such Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Bank, it being understood that any such
Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Bank

                                      -69-

<PAGE>

receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of Section 10.12 as
if it were a Bank hereunder. Such authorization shall survive the repayment of
the Loans and other Obligations and the termination of the Commitments.

          (c)  Disclosures of Tax Treatment. Notwithstanding anything herein or
in any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, the Company, the UK
Borrower, the Agent and each Bank (and each employee, representative or other
agent of any such Person) may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to such Person relating to such tax treatment
and tax structure. For purposes of this authorization, "tax treatment" means the
purported or claimed U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction, and
"tax structure" means any fact that may be relevant to understanding the
purported or claimed U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction. The
authorization to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions contemplated hereby contained in the preceding sentence was
applicable immediately upon commencement of discussions between the Company, the
UK Borrower and the Agent with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Company, the UK Borrower, the Agent
and each Bank each hereby acknowledges that, to the best of its knowledge, no
other party to this Agreement has made or provided a "tax statement" (as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulation section 301.6112-1(c)(2)(iii)) regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to, or for the benefit
of, the Company, the UK Borrower, the Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, or
any Person affiliated with the Company, the UK Borrower, the Agent or such Bank,
as the case may be.

          Section 10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by
different parties hereto on any number of separate counterparts, each of which,
when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, and all such counterparts
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

          Section 10.14 Agent's or Bank's Consent. Whenever the Agent's or any
Bank's consent is required to be obtained under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents as a condition to any action, inaction, condition or event,
the Agent and each Bank shall be authorized to give or withhold such consent in
its sole and absolute discretion and to condition its consent upon the giving of
additional collateral, the payment of money or any other matter.

          Section 10.15 Exceptions. The representations, warranties and
covenants contained herein shall be independent of each other, and no exception
to any representation, warranty or covenant shall be deemed to be an exception
to any other representation, warranty or covenant contained herein unless
expressly provided, nor shall any such exceptions be deemed to permit any action
or omission that would be in contravention of applicable Law.

          Section 10.16 CONSENT TO FORUM; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE
BORROWERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY
NEW YORK STATE COURT OR FEDERAL COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SITTING IN
NEW YORK CITY, AND WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS UPON IT. THE
COMPANY CONSENTS THAT ALL SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE MADE BY CERTIFIED

                                      -70-

<PAGE>

OR REGISTERED MAIL DIRECTED TO THE COMPANY AT THE ADDRESS PROVIDED FOR IN
SECTION 10.06 AND SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE COMPLETED UPON ACTUAL
RECEIPT THEREOF. THE UK BORROWER CONSENTS THAT ALL SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE
MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL DIRECTED TO THE COMPANY AT THE ADDRESS
PROVIDED IN SECTION 10.06 (AND THE UK BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY APPOINTS THE
COMPANY AS ITS AGENT TO RECEIVE SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS), AND SERVICE SO MADE
SHALL BE COMPLETED UPON ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF. EACH OF THE BORROWERS WAIVES ANY
OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY ACTION INSTITUTED AGAINST IT AS
PROVIDED HEREIN AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT ANY DEFENSE BASED ON LACK OF
JURISDICTION OR VENUE.

          EACH BORROWER, THE AGENT, AND EACH OF THE BANKS HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COLLATERAL TO THE
FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

          Section 10.17 Tax Withholding Clause. Each Bank or assignee or
participant of a Bank that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof (and, upon the written request of the
Agent, each other Bank or assignee or participant of a Bank) agrees that it will
deliver to each of the Borrowers and the Agent two (2) duly completed
appropriate valid Withholding Certificates (as defined under Section 1.1441-1(c)
(16) of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Regulations")) certifying its status
(i.e., U.S. or foreign person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of reduced,
or exemption from, U.S. withholding tax on the basis of an income tax treaty or
an exemption provided by the Internal Revenue Code. The term "Withholding
Certificate" means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and
the related statements and certifications as required under Section 1.1441-1(e)
(2) and/or (3) of the Regulations; a statement described in Section
1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the Regulations; or any other certificates under the
Internal Revenue Code or Regulations that certify or establish the status of a
payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or foreign person. Each Bank, assignee or
participant required to deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent a Withholding
Certificate pursuant to the preceding sentence shall deliver such valid
Withholding Certificate as follows: (A) each Bank which is a party hereto on the
Closing Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are payable
by the Borrowers hereunder for the account of such Bank; (B) each assignee or
participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5)
Business Days before the effective date of such assignment or participation
(unless the Agent in its sole discretion shall permit such assignee or
participant to deliver such valid Withholding Certificate less than five (5)
Business Days before such date in which case it shall be due on the date
specified by the Agent). Each Bank, assignee or participant which so delivers a
valid Withholding Certificate further undertakes to deliver to each of the
Borrowers and the Agent two (2) additional copies of such Withholding
Certificate (or a successor form) on or before the date that such Withholding
Certificate expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the most recent Withholding Certificate so delivered by
it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be
reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent. Notwithstanding the
submission of a Withholding Certificate claiming a reduced rate of or

                                      -71-

<PAGE>

exemption from U.S. withholding tax, the Agent shall be entitled to withhold
United States federal income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its
reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements
imposed upon a withholding agent under Section 1.1441-7(b) of the Regulations.
Further, the Agent is indemnified under Section 1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations
against any claims and demands of any Bank or assignee or participant of a Bank
for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with
regulations under Section 1441 of the Internal Revenue Code.

          Section 10.18 Joinder of Guarantors. Any Material Subsidiary of the
Company which is required to be a Guarantor pursuant to Section 7.02(i)
[Subsidiaries, Partnerships and Joint Ventures] shall execute and deliver to the
Agent (i) a Guarantor Joinder in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 1.01(G)(1) pursuant to which it shall join as a Guarantor each of the
documents to which the Guarantors are parties; and (ii) documents in the forms
described in Section 6.01 [First Loans] modified as appropriate to relate to
such Subsidiary. The Company shall deliver such Guarantor Joinder and related
documents to the Agent within five (5) Business Days after, as the case may be,
the date of the acquisition of such Subsidiary, the date upon which a Subsidiary
meets the criteria for a Material Subsidiary as set forth in the definition
thereof in Section 1.01, or the date the filing of such Subsidiary's certificate
or articles of incorporation if the Subsidiary is a corporation, the date of the
filing of its certificate of limited partnership if it is a limited partnership
or the date of its organization if it is an entity other than a limited
partnership or corporation.
