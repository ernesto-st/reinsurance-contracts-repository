                                           [ ] Hedged Currency Account
                                           [X] Multi-Currency Account
                                                         as hereinafter defined.

          a.   A Single Currency Account shall be invested 100% in the Base
               Currency as defined in Section I.2.a. Securities denominated in
               or linked to other currencies are permitted only at the direction
               of the Client.

          b.   A Hedged Currency Account shall be invested in securities
               denominated in or linked to any currency provided, however, that
               foreign exchange contracts, futures and/or options are executed
               to reduce the net non-Base Currency exposure to less than 5% of
               the Portfolio Market Value.

          c.   A Multi-Currency Account shall be invested in securities
               denominated in or linked to any currency. Whether or not foreign
               exchange contracts, futures and or options are permitted in
               Section I.2., the non-Base Currency exposure of the Portfolio
               shall not exceed 20.0% of the Portfolio Market Value. The net
               non-Base Currency exposure shall not exceed 20.0 % of the
               Portfolio Market Value

               Unless permitted in Section I.2., Foreign Exchange Contracts
               shall not be executed for a Multi-Currency Account except for the
               acquisition or disposition of securities or for the conversion of
               coupon/dividend receipts to the Portfolio Base Currency; no
               hedging or speculative currency transactions are permitted.

     2.   Country Risk

                                                         as hereinafter defined.

          All country limits are percent of Portfolio MARKET Value on date of
          purchase and refer to the country of issuer or guarantor. In the case
          of banking institutions, the country of a full branch shall be deemed
          to be the domicile of the head office. Country exposures shall not
          exceed the greater of the country limit or U.S. $5,000,000 equivalent

     3.   Issuer Limits

          a.   Except in the case of Supranational, Sovereign, and Sovereign -
               supported issues, where the limits under IV.2 above apply, the
               securities of one issuer should not exceed the greater of 10.0%
               of the Portfolio MARKET Value or U.S. $5,000,000 at time of
               purchase.

     4.   Issue Limits

          a.   In the case of fixed income securities, no holding should exceed
               the greater of 10% of the amount outstanding or U.S. $5,000,000
               nominal at the time of purchase.

     5.   Maturity Limits

          a.   In the case of fixed income securities, no individual security
               shall have a remaining MODIFIED DURATION greater than EIGHT
               YEARS.

          b.   In the case of money market securities, no individual security
               shall have a remaining MATURITY greater than TEN YEARS,
               notwithstanding the frequency of any rate reset provision of the
               security.

          c.   The Portfolio shall maintain a target WEIGHTED AVERAGE MODIFIED
               DURATION of between approximately 1.25 AND 3.75 YEARS. For
               purposes of this calculation only, the maturity of a floating
               rate security is deemed to be its next succeeding reset date.

     6.   US Securities

          The purchase of US securities IS permitted.

     7.   Credit Risk

          a.   All securities purchased for the Portfolio which carry a long
               term rating by either Standard & Poor's or Moody's shall have a
               rating of AA- or AA3 or better at the time of purchase.
               Notwithstanding the foregoing, securities may be purchased for
               the Portfolio which have ratings of A- or A3 or better provided
               that, in aggregate, they do not constitute more than 25% of the
               Portfolio MARKET Value. (Securities which are not so rated at the
               time of intended purchase shall not be permitted except on a case
               by case approval of the Client.)

               All securities purchased for the Portfolio which carry a short
               term rating by either Standard & Poor's or Moody's shall have a
               rating of A-1 or P-1 or better at the time of purchase.
               Notwithstanding the foregoing, securities may be purchased for
               the Portfolio which have ratings of A-2 or P-2 or better provided
               that, in aggregate, they do not constitute more than 25% of the
               Portfolio MARKET Value. (Securities which are not so rated at the
               time of intended purchase shall not be permitted except on a case
               by case approval of the Client.)

          b.   Unrated securities ARE permitted. The unrated securities shall
               have credit quality at the time of purchase, as determined in
               good faith by the Company, equivalent to other permitted
               securities which are rated as in IV.7.a. The Client shall be
               notified at least quarterly as to the composition and status of
               the unrated securities held in the Portfolio.



                                      -17-
<PAGE>   4
          c.   A security purchased either in accordance with Section IV.7.a.
               which receives a downwardly revised rating or in accordance with
               Section IV.7.b. which receives a newly established rating that in
               either case would make such security ineligible for further
               purchase remains a permitted security to the extent of the then
               current holdings.

          d.   Private placements ARE permitted. Any private placements
               purchased for the Portfolio shall be marketable securities. This
               permission is specifically intended to allow the purchase of
               unlisted securities.

          [ ]  Additional detail is attached as Credit Risk Schedule.


     8.   Realized Gains/Losses

          Net realized capital gains and losses should be minimized. (For
          example: To the extent fixed income assets are permitted, bond switch
          activity to enhance returns is encouraged, but should not become
          excessive and should be undertaken within the context of minimizing
          net gains and losses).


V.   GENERAL EQUITY GUIDELINES

     1.   The U.S. Equity portion of the Portfolio seeks to replicate the
          aggregate price and yield performance of the Standard & Poor's 500
          Composite Stock Price Index (the "S&P 500 Index"), an index which
          emphasizes large capitalization companies in the United States.

     2.   The Global Equity portion of the Portfolio seeks to outperform the
          total return of the MSCI World All Countries TR Free (USD) Index.


VI.  FEES

     The fee schedule will be calculated as follows: 0.35% per annum on the
     first $100 MILLION U.S. dollars, or equivalent of Portfolio MARKET value;
     0.25 % per annum on the next $100 MILLION; and 0.15 % per annum on any
     amount exceeding $200 MILLION.

     The fees will be calculated based on the previous month end MARKET value of
     the portfolio (including accrued interest) and are payable MONTHLY IN
     ARREARS. The fees shall be reduced proportionally for any part of a period
     in which this Agreement is not in full effect.
