From the Closing Date until December 31, 2004, the Buyer  shall have reasonable access
during normal business hours to the Records and to  the employees of the Seller or its
affiliates for purposes of conducting its  review of the Reinsurance Contracts.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
Other than the Assets (subject to Section 1.2(b) above), all  right, title and interest
in and to all other assets of the Seller will remain  the property of the Seller.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)
For greater certainty, in connection with paragraph  1.2(a)(ii) above, with respect to
any Reinsurance Contract, the Seller hereby  grants the Buyer the exclusive right from
the Closing Date until 120 days after  the expiration of such Reinsurance Contract
(except, in the case of (x)  Reinsurance Contracts which expire on December 31, 2003,
until 60 days after the  expiration of such contracts and (y) the Reinsurance Contracts
with Nova  Casualty Company and Associated Industries Insurance Company, until December
31,  2003, provided, that the Seller will not initiate discussions with Associated
Industries Insurance Company regarding the commutation of the Reinsurance  Contract to
which the Seller and Associated Industries Insurance Company are  parties prior to
December 19, 2003) (in each case, the &#147;<U>Outside  Date</U>&#148;) to novate or
otherwise assume the liabilities under such  Reinsurance Contract or to introduce the
Reinsurance Contracts to third parties  who are not affiliates of the Buyer and who may
offer finite reinsurance  business as set forth in Section 1.10. The Buyer will waive
this right only by  notice in writing to the Seller and such notice shall only apply in
respect of  the individual Reinsurance Contract referred to in such notice. The Seller
acknowledges that as part of any such novation or assumption, the Buyer may  amend the
terms and conditions of any Novated Contract in its discretion,  subject to agreement
with the Reinsured; provided, however, that the Buyer shall  not amend any Novated
Contract if the effect of such amendment would adversely  affect the amounts of Margin
Payments otherwise payable to the Seller in  accordance with the terms of the Novated
Contract without giving effect to such  amendment, unless the Seller consents to such
amendment in writing. Except as  contemplated by this Section 1.2(e), the Seller shall
not cancel, commute,  novate or otherwise alter or amend the terms of any Reinsurance
Contract until  after the applicable Outside Date. With respect to any particular
Reinsurance  Contract, after the earlier of (a) the time that the Buyer waives its rights
thereto as set forth in this Section 1.2(e), and (b) the applicable Outside  Date, the
Seller shall not be obligated to comply with this Section 1.2(e).  </P>

<U>Assumption of Liabilities</U>.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
As of any Transfer Date, pursuant to the terms and  conditions of the Novation
Amendments, the Seller shall assign and transfer  to<B> </B>the Buyer, and the Buyer
shall assume as legally binding and  enforceable direct obligations, without recourse to
Seller, one hundred percent  (100%) of the liabilities of the Seller as of the Transfer
Date, including,  without limitation, whether such liability is absolute, accrued,
contingent or  outstanding, asserted or unasserted, known or unknown, with respect to all
Liabilities (as defined in Section 1.3(b)) with respect to those Novated  Contracts
actually transferred to the Buyer pursuant to Section 1.2.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
For purposes of this Agreement, the term  &#147;<U>Liabilities</U>&#148; means the gross
liability of the Sellers on a  Novated Contract, except for any liability of the Seller
which was not disclosed  to the Buyer and arises from the Seller&#146;s bad faith in
discharging its  duties under Novated Contracts prior to the applicable Transfer Date.  </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"> 3 </P>
<br><br>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=100% SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
All Liabilities and Novated Contracts for which the Buyer is  liable under this Agreement
are subject in all respects to the same terms,  conditions, covenants, interpretations,
waivers, modifications, alterations and  cancellations as the original Reinsurance
Contracts, except that the  Reinsureds&#146; right of offset, if any, shall apply only in
respect of amounts  due under those Reinsurance Contracts that are Novated Contracts. The
Buyer  accepts and assumes as of the applicable Transfer Date the Liabilities subject  to
all defenses, setoffs and counterclaims to which the Seller would be entitled  with
respect to the Novated Contracts. It is expressly understood and agreed by  the parties
that, as between the Buyer and all Reinsureds (as defined in Section  1.3(d)) or third
persons or entities other than the Seller, no such defenses,  setoffs or counterclaims
are waived by the execution of this Agreement or the  consummation of the transaction
contemplated under this Agreement, and that as  of the applicable Transfer Date, the
Buyer shall be fully subrogated to all such  defenses, setoffs and counterclaims.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
The Buyer acknowledges that as of the applicable Transfer  Date, the Buyer is the
successor to the Seller under the Novated Contracts  actually transferred to the Buyer
pursuant to Section 1.2. Such Novated  Contracts shall be legally binding, enforceable
and direct obligations of the  Buyer, without recourse to Seller, and the Seller shall
have no liabilities  therefor. The Buyer shall substitute itself in the place of the
Seller as if  named in the place of the Seller. The Reinsureds (as defined in the
following  sentence) shall thereafter disregard the Seller as a party to such Novated
Contracts, and shall treat the Buyer as if it had been originally obligated  under such
Novated Contracts. For the purposes of this Agreement,  &#147;<U>Reinsured</U>&#148; or
&#147;<U>Reinsureds</U>&#148; means the named  reinsureds under any Reinsurance Contract.
After the applicable Transfer Date,  Reinsureds shall only have the right to file claims
arising under such Novated  Contracts directly with the Buyer. The Reinsureds shall have
a direct right of  action against the Buyer and the Buyer hereby consents to be subject
to direct  action taken by any Reinsured. The rights of any Reinsured shall be limited to
and consist of those rights set forth in the applicable Novated Contract  (including any
amendment to such Novated Contract) and no Reinsured shall have  the right to receive a
greater amount under such Novated Contract than such  party would have had in the absence
of this Agreement.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)
In assessing the rights of any Reinsured under a Novated  Contract, no effect shall be
given to the bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency,  reorganization or moratorium of the
Seller, or the effect of laws or legal  procedures affecting enforcement of creditors&#146; rights
against the Seller  generally.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4
<U>Right to Receive Payments; Power of Attorney</U>.  Premiums and other income amounts
due or paid on the Novated Contracts actually  transferred to the Buyer pursuant to
Section 1.2 on and after the applicable  Transfer Date shall be the sole property of<B> </B>the
Buyer. From and after the  applicable Transfer Date, all Reinsureds under the applicable
Novated Contracts  shall pay all premiums on such contracts directly to the Buyer. All
monies,  checks, drafts, wire transfers, orders, postal notes, other instruments and any
net set off to the benefit of any Seller Group Member in connection with a  Novated
Contract received by the Seller after the applicable Transfer Date for  such premiums,
loan repayments and other income amounts shall be transferred and  delivered to the
Buyer, and any such instruments when so delivered shall bear  all endorsements required
to effect such transfer and delivery. From and after  the applicable Transfer Date, the
Buyer shall be authorized, and hereby is  authorized, to endorse for payment any such
instruments payable to, or to the  order of, the Seller and received by the Buyer under
this Section 1.4. For each  Novated Contract actually transferred to the Buyer pursuant
to Section</p>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">1.2, the  Seller hereby constitutes and appoints, effective as of the
Transfer  Date with  respect to any such Novated Contract, the Buyer and its successors
and assigns  as the true and lawful attorney of the Seller with full power of

insurance regulatory  authorities in a particular jurisdiction) to each Reinsured that is
reinsured  under any Novated Contract, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to

Contract whose assignment to the Buyer is rejected by the  Reinsured or which assignment
is deemed by operation of law to have been  rejected shall hereinafter be referred to as

relationships with the Reinsureds under the  applicable Reinsurance Contracts, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to  encourage its cedents and brokers to engage in the
Business with respect to the  Renewal Rights with the Buyer. The Seller will provide such
assistance by  cooperating with the Buyer in sending each reinsured a letter in a form to
be  agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller. The Buyer expressly acknowledges that  its
purchase of the Renewal Rights is not a guarantee that the Reinsureds under  the
Reinsurance Contracts will each desire to have the Buyer continue as the  reinsurer
through which they obtain reinsurance. Other than the letters which  the Seller will
cooperate in sending to Reinsureds, the Seller will have no  responsibility for ensuring
that such Reinsureds establish or expand business  relationships with the Buyer<B>. </B> While
the Buyer shall consider the  existing terms and conditions provided by the Seller under
the Reinsurance  Contracts, the Buyer reserves the right to apply its own underwriting
guidelines  and judgement in the exercise of the Renewal Rights.  </P>

With effect  from the Effective Date, Substitute Reinsurer is substituted as the assuming

liability under the Reinsurance Contract(s) in  order to substitute Substitute Reinsurer
for PMA as the retrocedent under any  such retrocession agreement(s); and (iii) agrees to
pay Substitute Reinsurer,  within <B>[________ (__)]</B> days of the Effective Date, an

The Reinsured  hereby releases and holds PMA harmless from and against any and all

unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or outstanding, asserted or unasserted,  arising
out of or in connection with the Reinsurance Contract(s). The Reinsured  waives any right
of setoff or recoupment it may have had prior to or after the  Effective Date as to any
amount(s) due from or to PMA under any other agreement  (including, without limitation,
any reinsurance contract), and agrees (a) to  look solely to Substitute Reinsurer in
place of PMA for the performance of all  obligations under the Reinsurance Contract(s),
for which PMA is forever  discharged and (b) not to set off amounts due to the Reinsured
from PMA under  any such right of setoff or recoupment against amounts due to Substitute
Reinsurer under the Reinsurance Contract(s).  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
The Reinsured  agrees that it shall continue to be bound by the terms and conditions of

a party to the Reinsurance Contract(s) in place of PMA.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
Subject to  the further amendments to the Reinsurance Contract(s) as are set out in any
