                                 -------------

       Section 2.01   Advances Generally.  Subject to the provisions of this
                      ------------------
Agreement, each Lender will advance its Pro Rata Share of, and Borrower will
accept, the Loan Amount in installments as follows:

          The Initial Advance will be made upon the satisfaction of the
     applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02, and all subsequent
     advances shall be made monthly thereafter, upon the satisfaction of the
     applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.03, in amounts which shall be
     equal to the aggregate of the Direct and Indirect Costs incurred by
     Borrower through the end of the period covered by the Requisition less:
                                                                       ----

               (a)  the greater of (x) 10% of such Direct Costs until such time
          as the Improvements are 50% completed (as certified by the
          Construction Consultant) and 0% thereafter, provided that there shall
          be no retention in the case of "General Conditions" and "Contractor's
          Fee" under the General Contract or in the case of tenant allowances or
          tenant work not being performed by Borrower or (y) the actual
          "Retained Amounts" specified on the Direct and Indirect Cost
          Statement; and
                     ---

               (b)  the total of the Loan advances theretofore made;

     and, at the election of Administrative Agent, less any combination of the
     ---                                           ----
     following further amounts:

                                       18
<PAGE>

               (c)  all or a portion of the amount by which any Direct or
          Indirect Costs are or are estimated by Administrative Agent after
          consultation with Borrower to be greater than the respective Loan
          Budget Amounts for such costs; and/or

               (d)  any costs covered by the Requisition not approved, certified
          or verified as provided in Section 2.02, any Indirect Costs covered by
          a previous Requisition for which proof of payment (if required under
          this Agreement) has not been received by Administrative Agent, and/or
          any Direct Costs covered by a previous Requisition for which Payment
          Receipts/Lien Releases have not been received by Administrative Agent
          and the Construction Consultant.

     Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan only for the payment of Direct
and Indirect Costs shown on a Requisition in accordance with the approved
Project Cost Statement and this Agreement.  In no event shall proceeds of the
Loan be used, in whole or in part, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
"margin stock", as such quoted term is defined in Regulation U, or in connection
with a hostile acquisition or for any illegal purpose.

     The amount of each advance shall be a minimum of $1,000,000, unless the
undisbursed amount of the Loan is less than $1,000,000.

       Section 2.02  Certification and Verification of Costs.  Direct Costs are
                     ---------------------------------------
to be certified by the General Contractor or Borrower's supervisor of
construction if there is no General Contractor. Verification of the monthly
progress and Direct Costs which have been incurred by Borrower from time to
time, and the estimated total Direct Costs, shall be conclusively determined by
the Construction Consultant, except that both Direct and Indirect Costs are also
subject to approval and verification by Administrative Agent from time to time.

       Section 2.03  Procedures for Advances.  All advances to Borrower are to
                     -----------------------
be made at Administrative Agent's Office. Borrower shall submit Requisitions to
Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date which
is seven (7) Business Days prior to the date the advance is to be made.
Administrative Agent, no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the date a
requested advance is to be made, shall (i) notify each Lender either by
telephone or by facsimile of the amount requested by Borrower, the amount
approved by Administrative Agent, the portion of such advance to be funded by
such Lender and the proposed date of such advance and (ii) send to each Lender
by facsimile the summary pages of Borrower's Requisition (without attachments
except for the Direct and Indirect Cost Statement). Not later than 10:00 a.m.
(New York time) on the date of each advance, each Lender shall, through its
Applicable Lending Office and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, make
the amount to be advanced by it on such day available to Administrative Agent,
at Administrative Agent's Office and in immediately available funds. The amount
so received by Administrative Agent shall, subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, be made available to Borrower, by Administrative Agent's depositing
said amount into the Building Loan Trust Account.

                                       19
<PAGE>

Subsequent to the making of an advance, Administrative Agent shall deliver to a
Lender, within five (5) Business Days of such Lender's request, such material
relating to the Requisition for such advance as such Lender may reasonably
request.

       Section 2.04  Held-Back Amounts; Advances for Indirect Costs After
                     ----------------------------------------------------
Completion.  Amounts not advanced pursuant to paragraph (a) of Section 2.01
----------
during the course of construction of the Improvements shall be advanced upon the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.04. Loan Budget Amounts
for Indirect Costs not advanced prior to completion of construction of the
Improvements shall be advanced until exhausted, not more frequently than
monthly, for Indirect Costs as incurred after such completion.

       Section 2.05  Stored Materials.  Lenders shall not make advances of
                     ----------------
proceeds of the Loan for building materials or furnishings not yet affixed to or
incorporated into the Improvements, except as provided in this Section. Lenders
shall make Loan Advances, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, for
major building materials approved by Administrative Agent which are stored on
the Premises and intended to be incorporated into the Improvements pursuant to
the Plans, provided Administrative Agent shall have received (a) bills of sale
and other documentation evidencing payment in full of such materials, Borrower's
ownership thereof and the release of any right, title or lien in respect thereof
by any vendor, (b) evidence that such materials are covered by the insurance
policies required by this Agreement and are identified and protected against
loss, theft and damage in a manner acceptable to the Construction Consultant and
(c) evidence that advances made by Lenders for any materials stored on the
Premises do not, at any one time, exceed, in the aggregate, $10,000,000,
inclusive of the amount requested.

     Lenders shall make Loan advances, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, for fully-fabricated major building materials approved by
Administrative Agent, which are stored at locations off the Premises (including
on the land owned by Borrower or its Affiliates adjacent to the Premises (the
"Neighboring Premises")) prior to their incorporation into the Improvements
pursuant to the Plans, provided that, in the case of each such advance,
Administrative Agent shall have received (i) such security agreements, financing
statements and other documents as Administrative Agent may require sufficient to
create, perfect and protect a first lien on said materials, (ii) evidence that
said materials are covered by the insurance policies required by this Agreement,
(iii) a written statement from the storer of said materials (in the event the
owner of the storage location is other than Borrower) to the effect that
Administrative Agent and the Construction Consultant may freely inspect said
materials at all reasonable times (Borrower hereby agreeing that Administrative
Agent and the Construction Consultant may freely inspect said materials stored
on the Premises or other property of Borrower at reasonable times), (iv)
evidence that advances made by Lenders for said materials stored off the
Premises do not, at any one time, exceed, in the aggregate, $10,000,000,
inclusive of the amount requested and (v) evidence that said materials stored
off the Premises in locations other than the Neighboring Premises do not exceed,
in the aggregate, $2,500,000, inclusive of the amount requested.  Each request
for an advance of Loan proceeds for materials to be stored off-site shall
constitute Borrower's representation to

                                       20
<PAGE>

Lenders that said materials are (1) stored in a designated and secure area,
conspicuously marked to show that they are the subject of a security interest
held on behalf of Lenders, and that said materials will not be moved except in
connection with their delivery to the Premises, (2) effectively segregated from
all other materials of whatever kind located at the off-site location in
question and (3) reasonably anticipated to be incorporated into the Improvements
within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of the advance therefor.
Borrower covenants to deliver to Administrative Agent within ten (10) days of
any such advance (x) paid bills or other documents of title which correspond to
the materials so purchased and stored off-site, (y) evidence that title to said
materials has passed to Borrower outright, and that no lien has or will be filed
or claimed by the seller in connection therewith and (z) a certificate of
Borrower to the effect that said materials are owned by Borrower outright, free
and clear of all liens other than the lien held on behalf of Lenders and that
all of the terms of this Section have been complied with (the representations
set forth above and the statements contained in such certificate shall be deemed
to be "representations and warranties" of Borrower with the same force and
effect as if they had been set forth in Article V of this Agreement and the
accuracy thereof shall be subject to independent verification by Administrative
Agent and the Construction Consultant).

       Section 2.06  Contingency Advances.  There shall be no advances of the
                     --------------------
Loan Budget Amounts for "Contingency" unless mutually agreed by Borrower and
Administrative Agent; provided, however, that, following such time as the
                      --------  -------
Improvements have been satisfactorily completed, lien-free, Borrower shall be
entitled to advances of said Loan Budget Amounts to the extent it has actually
incurred and paid Costs in respect of completion of the Improvements from its
own funds and in excess of amounts advanced hereunder and has provided
appropriate evidence of such payment to Administrative Agent.

       Section 2.07  Reallocation of Amounts on Project Cost Statement. If at
                     -------------------------------------------------
any time the undisbursed balance of the Loan Budget Amount for any category of
cost shown on the Project Cost Statement (including, without limitation,
"Interest on Loan") is, in Administrative Agent's judgment, excessive, the
excess may be reallocated to any other Loan Budget Amount balance which
Administrative Agent deems to be insufficient after consultation with or upon
request of Borrower.

       Section 2.08  Certain Limitations on Advances.  Notwithstanding anything
                     -------------------------------
to the contrary contained herein, Lenders shall have no obligation to advance
any portion of the Loan Budget Amount, if any, for (a) "Tenant Work" (I) unless
Administrative Agent shall have received a copy, certified to be true and
complete, of the lease for space in the Improvements to which such Tenant Work
relates, and Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be,
shall have approved such lease, if such approval is required by this Agreement,
or (II) in an amount in excess of the TI Funding Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to satisfaction of all other conditions to funding set forth
in this Agreement, Lenders shall fund 100% of the amount requested by Borrower
for Tenant Work under the Crate & Barrel Lease as and when a request therefor is
included in a Requisition; and (b) "Interest on Loan" (i) if, when and to the
extent that Administrative Agent, in its sole judgment, determines that the
Premises and

                                       21
<PAGE>

Improvements are generating, on a cash basis, positive cash flow in excess of
Borrower's other usual, reasonable and customary expenses regarding the Premises
and Improvements or (ii) if and to the extent that Borrower shall have
previously paid any interest under the Notes from sources other than advances
hereunder or agreements supplemental hereto.

As used in this Section:

     "Applicable TI Rate" shall mean: (a) $61.44 per square foot for the first
165,307 SFGLA for which Borrower submits a Requisition requesting payment of
costs for Tenant Work; (b) $43.88 per square foot for the next 165,307 SFGLA for
which Borrower submits a Requisition requesting payment of costs for Tenant
Work; and (c) a per square foot amount equal to the quotient of $4,352,560
divided by 165,308 square feet for the remaining SFGLA for which Borrower
submits a Requisition requesting payment of costs for Tenant Work.  The
calculation of Applicable TI Rate shall not take into account the SFGLA leased
pursuant to the Crate & Barrel Lease.

     "Tenant Work" shall mean any tenant improvement work performed or tenant
improvement allowances paid by Borrower to or for the benefit of tenants under
Qualifying Leases.

     "TI Cost Pool" shall mean at any time an amount equal to the sum of the
Applicable TI Rate multiplied by the amount of SFGLA covered by Qualifying
Leases for which Borrower has submitted a Requisition requesting payment of
costs for Tenant Work.

     "TI Cost Pool Balance" shall mean the amount in the TI Cost Pool, from time
to time, less the amount previously advanced to Borrower by Lenders for payment
of costs for Tenant Work.

     "TI Funding Amount" shall mean the lesser of: (a) the TI Cost Pool Balance
at the time a Requisition is submitted by Borrower which includes a request for
payment of Tenant Work; or (b) the sum of (i) the actual amount actually
requested by Borrower for a particular tenant in a Requisition that includes a
request for Tenant Work plus (ii) any amounts in the TI Shortfall Pool.

     "TI Shortfall Pool" shall mean at any time the aggregate difference between
amounts actually paid by Borrower to tenants under Qualifying Leases for Tenant
Work and the amounts previously funded by Lenders for Tenant Work for such
tenants, less the aggregate amount previously funded pursuant to clause (b)(ii)
         ----
of the definition of "TI Funding Amount" above.

       Section 2.09  Nature of Lenders' Obligations; Borrower's Rights and
                     -----------------------------------------------------
Obligations in Event a Lender Fails to Make an Advance.  The obligations of
------------------------------------------------------
Lenders under this Agreement are several, and no Lender shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Lender to fund the portion required to be funded by
such other Lender of an advance of the Loan. In cases where a Delinquent Lender
fails to fund the portion required to be funded by it of an advance and (x) none
of the other Lenders elects to be

                                       22
<PAGE>

an Electing Lender pursuant to Section 7.16 and to fund the Delinquent Lender's
share of the advance and (y) Borrower is unable to procure a Replacement Lender
in accordance with Section 7.20, the obligation of the Non-Delinquent Lenders to
fund their respective portions of such advance and each subsequent advance shall
be conditioned on (i) Borrower's committing in writing to Lenders, prior to any
such advance, that it will fund the entire Delinquency Amount and (ii)
Borrower's submitting satisfactory evidence to Administrative Agent, at the time
of each advance, that Borrower and/or Guarantor have paid, from their own funds,
a portion of the Direct and Indirect Costs that are the subject of such advance
in an amount equal to the Delinquent Lender's portion of such advance.

       Section 2.10  Notes.  The Loan shall be evidenced by notes of Borrower
                     -----
in the form of EXHIBIT H, duly completed and executed by Borrower (one for each
Lender in an amount equal to such Lender's Individual Loan Commitment, payable
for the account of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office), in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the Loan Amount (such notes, as the same may hereafter
be amended, modified, extended, severed, assigned, substituted, renewed or
restated from time to time (including, without limitation, any substitute notes
pursuant to Section 3.05, 7.16, 7.20 or 8.12), each, a "Note" and collectively,
the "Notes"). The Notes shall mature, and all outstanding principal and other
sums thereunder shall be paid in full, on the Maturity Date, as the same may be
accelerated or extended.

     In case of any loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Lender's Note,
Borrower shall, upon its receipt of an affidavit of an officer of such Lender as
to such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation and an appropriate
indemnification, execute and deliver a replacement Note to such Lender in the
same principal amount and otherwise of like tenor as the lost, stolen, destroyed
or mutilated Note.

       Section 2.11  Payments and Distributions; Certain Consequences of
                     ---------------------------------------------------
Delinquent Lender Status.  Borrower shall make each payment under this Agreement
------------------------
and under the Notes not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date when
due to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office in immediately
available funds. Administrative Agent will thereafter, on the day of its receipt
of each such payment, cause to be distributed to each Lender such Lender's
appropriate share (based upon the respective outstanding principal amounts of
the Notes and the respective rates of interest thereunder) of the payments of
principal and interest, and its appropriate share of the payments of other sums,
in like funds for the account of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office.
Payments by Borrower hereunder or under the Notes or other Loan Documents shall
be made without setoff or counterclaim.

     Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, whenever any
payment to be made under this Agreement or under the Notes is due on any day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of the payment of interest and, if applicable, fees, as the case may
be.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, (i)
Administrative Agent shall make no payment to a Delinquent Lender until the Non-
Delinquent Lenders

                                       23
<PAGE>

have been paid in full all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest
and any other sums owing to them under the Loan Documents, it being understood
that payments of interest on account of the outstanding principal amount of the
Note held by the Delinquent Lender shall be held by Administrative Agent in a
non-interest bearing account and not distributed to the Delinquent Lender until
such time as all principal, interest and other sums due to the Non-Delinquent
Lenders have been paid in full, (ii) any payments (other than interest, as
provided in clause (i) above) that would otherwise be due a Delinquent Lender
shall be distributed to the Non-Delinquent Lenders until such time as all
principal, interest and other sums due to the Non-Delinquent Lenders have been
paid in full (except that any such amounts otherwise due a Delinquent Lender
received by Administrative Agent during an Election Period shall be retained by
Administrative Agent until the expiration of the Election Period and either paid
to the Delinquent Lender, if the delinquency is cured, or paid to the Non-
Delinquent Lenders, if the delinquency is not cured) and (iii) Administrative
Agent shall deduct, from amounts due (or, in the case of Delinquent Lender,
amounts that would otherwise be payable to such Delinquent Lender being held by
Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (i) above) Lender in default under its
obligations under Section 7.05, the amount owing by such Lender pursuant to said
Section 7.05 and pay the amount so deducted to itself, the other Lenders, or
such other party as is entitled to such amount, as applicable.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the
Delinquent Lender's Note, to the extent a Delinquent Lender is obligated under
this Agreement to advance Loan proceeds in respect of interest on the Notes, and
fails to do so, and such amount is not funded by a Replacement Lender or
Electing Lender, such portion of the interest on the Delinquent Lender's Note
(i.e., the interest on the Delinquent Lender's Note that, absent the Delinquent
 - -
Lender's Delinquency, would have been paid by advances from the Loan Budget
Amount for "Interest on Loan", until the same was fully disbursed) shall accrue
(without compounding) and payment thereof shall be deferred until the Maturity
Date (whether as stated or by acceleration or otherwise).

     If, following such time as all amounts owing under the Loan to the Non-
Delinquent Lenders and Administrative Agent have been paid in full,
Administrative Agent is holding funds in respect of amounts payable to the
Delinquent Lender as provided in the third paragraph of this Section,
Administrative Agent shall file an interpleader action in New York State Supreme
Court, New York County and shall deposit the funds so held (less a sum equal to
Administrative Agent's reasonable fees and expenses in connection with said
interpleader action and deposit) with said court and Administrative Agent shall
thereupon be relieved of responsibility to any party with respect to the funds
deposited.  Borrower and each Delinquent Lender hereby jointly and severally
agree to reimburse Administrative Agent for all costs and expenses that
Administrative Agent may incur in connection with the foregoing interpleader
action.

     Except as provided above in this Section and in Section 7.16, each Lender's
interest in the Loan shall be of equal priority with the interest of each other
Lender.

       Section 2.12  Interest.  Borrower shall have the option, subject to the
                     --------
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, of paying interest on the
Principal Amount or

                                       24
<PAGE>

portions thereof at the Prime Based Rate or the LIBO Based Rate. If Borrower
desires the application of the LIBO Based Rate, it shall submit a LIBO Rate
Request to Administrative Agent, which LIBO Rate Request shall be irrevocable,
subject to Borrower's right to convert the rate of interest payable under the
Notes with respect to any LIBOR Amount from the LIBO Based Rate to the Prime
Based Rate as provided in Section 2.14. Administrative Agent shall, on the day
of its receipt of the LIBO Rate Request from Borrower, notify each Lender by
either telephone or by facsimile of the specified LIBOR Amount and the amount of
the Lender's portion thereof, the Interest Period and date of commencement
thereof, and the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Amount. Each LIBO Rate
Request shall be applicable to the Notes in accordance with the Lenders'
respective Pro Rata Shares, so that, barring a conversion or suspension of the
LIBO Based Rate by one or more, but not all, Lenders, pursuant to Article III,
the outstanding principal amounts of each of the Notes shall contain segments
bearing interest at the Prime Based Rate and/or LIBO Based Rate(s) under
particular Interest Period(s), each of which segments shall correspond to a
proportional segment of the outstanding principal amount of every other Note.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Lender shall fail to fund the portion it is
required to fund of any advance of the Loan and an Electing Lender shall commit
to fund the Delinquency Amount pursuant to Section 7.16, then from and after the
time of the first disbursement of the Delinquency Amount by the Electing Lender,
(i) in the case of a LIBO Rate Request with respect to an advance, such LIBO
Rate Request shall be applicable to the Notes in accordance with the respective
portions of such advance made by the Lenders; (ii) in the case of a LIBO Rate
Request with respect to a portion of the Principal Amount bearing interest at
the Prime Based Rate to be converted to the LIBO Based Rate, such LIBO Rate
Request shall be applicable to the Notes ratably in accordance with the portions
of the outstanding principal balances under the respective Notes bearing
interest at the Prime Based Rate; and (iii) in the case of a LIBO Rate Request
with respect to an existing LIBOR Amount that is to be the subject of a new
Interest Period, such LIBO Rate Request shall be applicable to the Notes ratably
in accordance with the respective portions of such existing LIBOR Amount
allocable to the respective Notes. In the event that Borrower fails to submit a
LIBO Rate Request with respect to a LIBOR Amount not later than 12 Noon (New
York time) four (4) Business Days prior to the last day of the relevant Interest
Period, the LIBOR Amount in question shall bear interest, commencing at the end
of such Interest Period, at the LIBO Based Rate for an Interest Period of one
(1) month.

     Interest shall be computed on an actual/360-day basis (i.e., interest for
                                                            - -
each day during which any portion of the Principal Amount is bearing interest at
a particular interest rate per annum shall be computed at such rate divided by
360).

     Borrower shall pay interest on the Principal Amount to Administrative Agent
for the account of Lenders.  Interest on the Principal Amount shall be payable,
in arrears, monthly on the first day of the first month following the Initial
Advance and on the first day of each month thereafter until the Notes are repaid
in full.

       Section 2.13  Limitation on Number of Interest Periods.  Borrower shall
                     ----------------------------------------
not have the right to have more than six (6) Interest Periods, in the aggregate,
in respect of

                                       25
<PAGE>

the Loan in effect at any one time, whether or not any portion of the Principal
Amount is then bearing interest at the Prime Based Rate.

       Section 2.14  Conversions of Interest Rate.  Provided there exists no
                     ----------------------------
Event of Default, Borrower shall have the right to convert, from time to time,
the rate of interest payable under the Notes with respect to any portion of the
Principal Amount to the LIBO Based Rate or the Prime Based Rate, subject to the
terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the payment of all
amounts due in connection with any such conversion from the LIBO Based Rate on a
date other than the last day of an applicable Interest Period) and provided
                                                                   --------
that, in the case of a conversion from the LIBO Based Rate, the entire LIBOR
Amount is the subject of the conversion. Conversions shall be accomplished (i)
in the case of a conversion from the Prime Based Rate to the LIBO Based Rate, by
Borrower's submission of a LIBO Rate Request in accordance with Section 2.12 or
(ii) in the case of a conversion from the LIBO Based Rate to the Prime Based
Rate, by Borrower's request to Administrative Agent by telephone (to be promptly
confirmed in writing), to be received by Administrative Agent at least four (4)
Business Days prior to the date specified for such conversion, specifying the
LIBOR Amount with respect to which the interest rate is to be converted and the
date of the conversion. On the date of its receipt of such request,
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof either by telephone or by
facsimile.

       Section 2.15  Inapplicability of LIBO Based Rate.  Any portion of the
                     ----------------------------------
Principal Amount to which the LIBO Based Rate is not or cannot pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement be applicable shall bear interest at the Prime Based
Rate. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the entire Principal Amount
shall, at the option of the Required Lenders, immediately and without notice to
Borrower, bear interest at the Prime Based Rate. In addition, during the
existence of an Event of Default, Borrower shall have no right to submit a LIBO
Rate Request with respect to any LIBOR Amount for which the current Interest
Period is expiring. The foregoing provisions shall not be construed as a waiver
by Lenders of their right to pursue any other remedies available to them under
the Mortgage or any other Loan Document nor shall they be construed to limit in
any way the application of the Default Rate as provided in the Mortgage.

       Section 2.16  Late Payment Premium.  Borrower shall pay to Administrative
                     --------------------
Agent for the account of Lenders a late payment premium in the amount of 5% of
any payments of principal (other than principal due on the Maturity Date, as it
may be accelerated or extended under the terms hereof) or interest under the
Loan made more than ten (10) days after the due date thereof, which late payment
premium shall be due with any such late payment.

       Section 2.17  Voluntary Prepayments.  Borrower may, upon at least thirty
                     ---------------------
(30) days' notice (which notice shall be irrevocable) to Administrative Agent,
prepay the Principal Amount, in whole or part, without premium or penalty;
provided, however, that (i) any partial prepayment under this Section shall be
--------  -------
in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 and an integral multiple of
$100,000 (other than in the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section 8.24), (ii)
prepayment of a LIBOR Amount other than on the last day of the applicable
Interest Period shall be subject to the provisions of Section

                                       26
<PAGE>

3.03 and (iii) each prepayment under this Section shall include all interest
accrued on the amount of principal prepaid (and all late charges and other sums
that may be payable) through the date of prepayment. Amounts prepaid may not be
reborrowed.

       Section 2.18  Extension(s) of Maturity Date.  Borrower shall have the
                     -----------------------------
option, exercisable twice, to extend the Maturity Date for a period of one (1)
year, subject in each case (unless otherwise indicated), to (the "First
Extension Conditions" and "Second Extension Conditions", respectively) (i) the
absence of any Event of Default at both the time the option is exercised and on
the Maturity Date to be extended, (ii) Administrative Agent's receipt of (w) a
written request from Borrower for such extension between sixty (60) and one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Maturity Date to be extended (upon the
receipt of which Administrative Agent shall promptly commission the update to
the appraisal required by clause (3) or (6), as applicable, below), (x) no later
than one day prior to the Maturity Date to be extended, an extension fee, for
the account of Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, in
the amount of .25% of the Commitment Amount as of the Maturity Date to be
extended, (y) such note extension agreement(s) as Administrative Agent may
reasonably require and (z) such interest rate protection agreements, and
assignments thereof, as Administrative Agent may reasonably require and (iii)
Administrative Agent's determination (which shall be conclusive so long as made
on a reasonable basis) that, as of the Maturity Date to be extended, Guarantor
is in compliance with the covenants set forth in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the
Payment Guaranty, and that,

     for the first extension:
     -----------------------

          (1)  the Improvements (other than (A) Building 5 and Building 9, (B)
     unleased tenant space and (C) minor "punch-list" items) have been
     satisfactorily completed, lien-free, in accordance with this Agreement and
     all building and other permits necessary for the tenants thereof to begin
     to fit out their premises have been issued by the appropriate Governmental
     Authority;

          (2)  at least 75% of the total SFGLA in the Retail/Tenant-Constructed
     Improvements is covered by Qualifying Leases (including the Book Store
     Lease and the Crate & Barrel Lease ); and

          (3)  the Commitment Amount does not exceed 65% of the "stabilized"
     value of the Premises (as reflected in an update to the appraisal delivered
     pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(4), which updated appraisal shall be
     commissioned by Administrative Agent at Borrower's expense); and,

     for the second extension:
     ------------------------

          (4)  the Hotel, the Tenant-Constructed Improvements and the
     Improvements (other than (A) unleased tenant space and (B) minor "punch-
     list" items) have been satisfactorily completed, lien-free, in accordance
     with this Agreement and final certificates of occupancy issued therefor by
     the appropriate Governmental Authority;

                                       27
<PAGE>

          (5)  at least 85% of the total SFGLA in the Retail/Tenant-Constructed
     Improvements is covered by Qualifying Leases (including the Book Store
     Lease and the Crate & Barrel Lease) having an unexpired term of one (1)
     year or more and at least 75% of the Residential Units is covered by
     Residential Leases, in each case pursuant to which the tenants thereunder
     are in occupancy and paying rent;

          (6)  the Commitment Amount does not exceed 65% of the "as-is" value of
     the Premises (as reflected in an update to the appraisal delivered pursuant
     to Section 4.01(a)(4), which updated appraisal shall be commissioned by
     Administrative Agent at Borrower's expense); and

          (7)  Debt Service Coverage is at least 1.25;

provided, however, that the foregoing loan-to-value and Debt Service Coverage
--------  -------
conditions set forth in clauses (3), (6) and (7) above shall be deemed satisfied
if Borrower makes a partial prepayment of the Principal Amount on or before the
Maturity Date to be extended in an amount such that the requisite loan-to-value
or Debt Service Coverage, each recomputed based on the reduced Commitment
Amount, is attained.

       Section 2.19  Required Amortization During Second Extension Term.  If the
                     --------------------------------------------------
original Maturity Date is extended by Borrower for two (2) one year periods
pursuant to the exercise of its options to extend in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.18, then, commencing on the first day of the second
month following the second such extension, and on the first day of each month
thereafter until the extended Maturity Date, Borrower shall, and hereby
covenants and promises to, make monthly payments in reduction of the Principal
Amount. The amount of such principal payments shall be computed in accordance
with a thirty (30)-year fully amortizing, constant payment mortgage schedule
based on the Commitment Amount at the time of the first such payment date and an
assumed per annum interest rate of 9.25%.

       Section 2.20  Interest Rate Reduction.
                     -----------------------

      (a)  Provided there exists no Default or Event of Default, the Applicable
Margin with respect to the Prime Based Rate and the LIBO Based Rate shall be

9, (B) unleased tenant space and (C) minor "punch list" items) have been
satisfactorily completed, lien-free, in accordance with this Agreement and all
building and other permits necessary for the tenants thereof to begin to fit out
their respective premises have been issued by the appropriate Governmental
Authority, (2) Debt Service Coverage is at least 1.00, provided, however, that
                                                       --------  -------
in computing Debt Service Coverage for purposes of this clause (C), the revenue
component of Net Operating Income under clause (a) of the definition thereof in
Section 1.01 of the Agreement shall, for any date of determination, be a pro-
forma amount computed as set forth in sub-clause (x) of said clause (a) but
based only on leases where all acceptance-of-possession co-tenancy requirements
have been satisfied and (3) Guarantor is in compliance with the covenants set
forth in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the

                                       28
<PAGE>

Payment Guaranty and (ii) .00% per annum and 1.625% per annum, respectively,
upon Administrative Agent's determination (which shall be conclusive so long as
made on a reasonable basis) that (1) the Hotel, the Tenant-Constructed
Improvements and the Improvements (other than (A) unleased tenant space in the
Improvements and (B) minor "punch-list" items) have been satisfactorily
completed, lien-free, in accordance with this Agreement and final certificates
of occupancy issued therefor by the appropriate Governmental Authority, (2) at

Reduction", respectively.

     (b)  If at any time following Borrower's qualification for the First Rate
Reduction and/or the Second Rate Reduction pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the
conditions precedent to such reduction as set forth in said paragraph (a) cease
to be satisfied, then the Applicable Margins shall, automatically and without
the need for any further documentation or action of any kind, be increased
retroactively to the date any such condition ceased to be satisfied by the
amount of the prior reduction, subject, however, to further decrease and
increase in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

     Section 3.01  Additional Costs and Other Effects of Regulatory Changes.
                   --------------------------------------------------------
Borrower shall pay directly to a Lender, promptly upon demand, such amounts as
are necessary to compensate such Lender for Additional Costs resulting from any
Regulatory Change which (i) subjects such Lender to any tax, duty or other
charge with respect to the Loan or its Note, or changes the basis of taxation of
any amounts payable to such Lender under the Loan or its Note (other than taxes
imposed on the overall net income of such Lender or of its Applicable Lending
Office by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal office or such
Applicable Lending Office is located), (ii) imposes, modifies or deems
applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements relating to any
extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other
liabilities of, such Lender, (iii) imposes on such Lender or, in the case of
LIBOR Amounts, on the London interbank market, any other condition affecting the
Loan or its Note, or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or (iv)
imposes any capital adequacy requirements on such Lender by virtue of the Loan
or the Notes.  Such Lender will notify Borrower (with a copy to Administrative
Agent) of any event occurring after the date hereof which would entitle it to
compensation pursuant to this paragraph as promptly as practicable after it
obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation, and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office for those portions of the Loan
affected

                                       29
<PAGE>

by such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in such Lender's sole opinion, be
disadvantageous to it, provided that such Lender shall have no obligation to so
                       --------
designate an Applicable Lending Office located in the United States.

     Without limiting the effect of the immediately preceding paragraph, in the
event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, (i) a Lender incurs Additional
Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount
of (1) a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender which includes
deposits by reference to which the LIBO Rate is determined as provided in this
Agreement and/or (2) a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such
Lender which includes loans the interest on which is determined on the basis of
rates referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.01, (ii) a
Lender becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of
liabilities or assets which it may hold or (iii) it shall be unlawful or
impossible for a Lender to make or maintain its Pro Rata Share of the Loan (or
any portion thereof) at the LIBO Based Rate, then such Lender's obligation to
make or maintain its Pro Rata Share of the Loan (or portions thereof) at the
LIBO Based Rate (and Borrower's right to request the same) shall be suspended
and such Lender shall give notice thereof to Borrower (with a copy to
Administrative Agent) and, upon the giving of such notice, interest payable on
the affected Note shall be converted to the Prime Based Rate, unless such Lender
may lawfully continue to maintain its Pro Rata Share of the Loan (or any portion
thereof) then bearing interest at the LIBO Based Rate to the end of the current
Interest Period(s), at which time the interest rate on the affected Note shall
convert to the Prime Based Rate.  If subsequent to any conversion to the Prime
Based Rate as provided above such Lender determines that such Regulatory Change
has ceased to be in effect, such Lender will so notify Borrower (with a copy to
Administrative Agent), and Borrower may convert the rate of interest payable
under the affected Note with respect to those portions of the Principal Amount
bearing interest at the Prime Based Rate to the LIBO Based Rate by submitting a
LIBO Rate Request in respect thereof and otherwise complying with the provisions
of this Agreement with respect thereto.

     Determinations by each Lender of the existence or effect of any Regulatory
Change on its costs of making or maintaining its Pro Rata Share of the Loan, or
portions thereof, at the LIBO Based Rate, or on amounts receivable by it in
respect thereof, and of the additional amounts required to compensate such
Lender in respect of Additional Costs, shall be conclusive, so long as made on a
reasonable basis.

       Section 3.02  Limitations on Availability of LIBO Based Rate.  Anything
                     ----------------------------------------------
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, at the time of or prior to the
determination of the LIBO Based Rate in respect of any LIBO Rate Request Amount
as provided in this Agreement, (i) Administrative Agent determines (which
determination shall be conclusive, so long as made on a reasonable basis) that
by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market generally,
adequate and fair means do not or will not exist for determining the LIBO Based
Rate applicable to an Interest Period or (ii) a Lender determines (which
determination shall be conclusive, so long as made on a reasonable basis) that
the LIBO Rate will not accurately reflect the cost to such Lender of making or
maintaining its Pro Rata Share of the Loan (or any portion thereof) at the

                                       30
<PAGE>

LIBO Based Rate, then Administrative Agent, in the case of the circumstances
described in clause (i) above, or such Lender, in the case of the circumstances
described in clause (ii) above, shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof (with
a copy to Administrative Agent in the case of the notice from such Lender), and
the LIBO Rate Request Amount in question, in the case of the circumstances
described in clause (i) above, or such Lender's portion thereof, in the case of
the circumstances described in clause (ii) above, shall bear interest, or
continue to bear interest, as the case may be, at the Prime Based Rate. If at
any time subsequent to Administrative Agent's or such Lender's giving of such
notice, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, determines that
because of a change in circumstances the LIBO Based Rate is again available to
Borrower, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall so
notify Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent, in the case of the notice
from such Lender) and Borrower may convert the rate of interest payable under
the Notes or such Lender's Note, as the case may be, from the Prime Based Rate
to the LIBO Based Rate by submitting a LIBO Rate Request in respect thereof and
otherwise complying with the provisions of this Agreement with respect thereto.

       Section 3.03  Certain Compensation.  Borrower shall pay directly to a
                     --------------------
Lender, immediately upon request and notwithstanding contrary provisions
contained in the Mortgage or other Loan Documents, such amounts as shall, in the
judgment of such Lender (which shall be conclusive so long as made on a
reasonable basis), compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as
a result of (i) any payment or prepayment (under any circumstances whatsoever,
whether voluntary or involuntary) of any portion of the Principal Amount bearing
interest at the LIBO Based Rate on a date other than the last day of an
applicable Interest Period, (ii) the conversion (for any reason whatsoever,
whether voluntary or involuntary) of the rate of interest payable under such
Lender's Note from the LIBO Based Rate to the Prime Based Rate with respect to
any portion of the Principal Amount then bearing interest at the LIBO Based Rate
on a date other than the last day of an applicable Interest Period, (iii) the
failure of all or a portion of an advance of the Loan which was to have borne
interest at the LIBO Based Rate pursuant to a LIBO Rate Request to be made, (iv)
any failure by Borrower to prepay any portion of the Principal Amount bearing
interest at the LIBO Based Rate on the date specified in Borrower's notice of
prepayment or (v) the failure of Borrower to borrow, continue or convert in
accordance with a LIBO Rate Request submitted by it, which amounts shall
include, without limitation, an amount equal to the present value (using as a
discount rate the rate at which interest is computed pursuant to clause (y)
below) of the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest that would have
accrued at the LIBO Based Rate on the amount so prepaid, converted, not
advanced, not prepaid or not borrowed, continued or converted, as the case may
be, for the period from the date of occurrence to the last day of the applicable
Interest Period over (y) the amount of interest (as determined in good faith by
such Lender) that such Lender would have paid to Borrower (and other customers)
on a Euro-Dollar deposit placed by such Lender with leading banks in the London
interbank market for an amount comparable to the amount so prepaid, converted,
not advanced, not prepaid or not borrowed, continued or converted, as the case
may be, for the period from the date of occurrence to the last day of the
applicable Interest Period. A determination by a Lender as to the amounts
payable to it pursuant to this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

                     ---------------------

       Section 3.05  Substitution of Lenders.  If any Lender (an "Affected
                     -----------------------
Lender") (i) makes demand upon Borrower for (or if Borrower is otherwise
required to pay) Additional Costs pursuant to Section 3.01 or (ii) gives notice
to Borrower that such Lender is unable to make or maintain its Pro Rata Share of
the Loan at the LIBO Based Rate as a result of a condition described in clause
(ii) of Section 3.02 or in the second paragraph of Section 3.01, Borrower may,
within ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand or notice, as the case may be,
give notice (a "Substitution Notice") to Administrative Agent and to each Lender
of its intention to replace such Affected Lender with another financial
institution (the "Substitute Lender") designated in such Substitution Notice.
If, within thirty (30) days of Administrative Agent's receipt of such
Substitution Notice, (x) Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and each
Lender in writing that the Substitute Lender is reasonably satisfactory to the
Required Lenders and (y) the Affected Lender shall not agree to waive the
payment of the Additional Costs in question or the effect of the circumstances
described in clause (ii) of Section 3.02 or in the second paragraph of Section
3.01, then the Affected Lender shall, so long as no Default shall exist, assign
its Note and all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the
Substitute Lender, and the Substitute Lender shall assume all of the Affected
Lender's rights and obligations, pursuant to an agreement, substantially in the
form of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, executed by the Affected Lender
and the Substitute Lender. In connection with such assignment and assumption,
the Substitute Lender shall pay to the Affected Lender an amount equal to the
outstanding principal amount under the Affected Lender's Note plus all interest
accrued thereon, plus all other amounts, if any (other than the Additional Costs
in question), then due and payable to the Affected Lender with respect to the
Loan; provided, however, that prior to or simultaneously with any such
      --------  -------
assignment and assumption, Borrower shall have paid to such Affected Lender all
amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed under this Article III. Upon the
effective date of such assignment and assumption and the payment by the
Substitute Lender to Administrative Agent of a fee, for Administrative Agent's
own account, in the amount of $3,500, the Substitute Lender shall become a party
to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender as
set forth in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the Affected Lender
shall be released from its obligations hereunder, and no further consent or
action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment
pursuant to this Section, a note shall be issued to the Substitute Lender by
Borrower, in substitution for the Affected Lender's Note, and the Affected
Lender shall return its Note to Borrower. Such substitute note shall constitute
a "Note", and the obligations evidenced by such substitute note shall be secured
by the Mortgage. In connection with Borrower's execution of such substitute note
as aforesaid, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent such evidence of
the due authorization, execution and delivery of the substitute note and any
related documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request; provided,
                                                                  --------
however, that Borrower shall not be required to deliver a legal opinion in
-------
connection with such substitute note. If the Substitute Lender is not
incorporated under the Laws of the United States or a state thereof, it shall,
prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its
account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent

                                       32
<PAGE>

certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes in accordance with Section 7.13.

     Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall execute such modifications
to the Loan Documents as shall, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative
Agent, be necessary or desirable in connection with the substitution of Lenders
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section.

                     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; RELATIONS AMONG LENDERS
                     ---------------------------------------------

     Section 7.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities of Administrative Agent.
                  ----------------------------------------------------------
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to
act as its agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document with such powers as
are specifically delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms of this
Agreement and any other Loan Document, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, and Administrative Agent hereby accepts such
appointment and authorization in accordance with such terms. Administrative
Agent shall perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
documents in good faith according to the same standard of care as that
customarily exercised by Administrative Agent in administering its own real
estate loans. Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and any other Loan Document
or required by Law, and shall not by reason of this Agreement be a fiduciary or
trustee for any Lender except to the extent that Administrative Agent acts as an
agent with respect to the receipt or payment of funds, nor shall Administrative
Agent have any fiduciary duty to Borrower nor shall any Lender have any
fiduciary duty to Borrower or any other Lender. No implied covenants,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against Administrative Agent. Neither
Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be responsible to Lenders for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower or any
officer, partner or official of Borrower or any other Person contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document or
instrument referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under,
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the value, legality, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument referred to or
provided for herein or therein, for the perfection or priority of any lien
securing the obligations hereunder or thereunder or for any failure by Borrower
or any Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be
responsible, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be
liable or responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken

                                      53
<PAGE>

by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

     Section 7.02 Reliance by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall
                  --------------------------------
be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to
be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the
proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by Administrative Agent.
Administrative Agent may deem and treat each Lender as the holder of its Note
and interest in the Loan for all purposes hereof and shall not be required to
deal with any Person who has acquired a Participation in the Loan from a Lender.
As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting,
or in refraining from acting, in accordance with instructions signed by the
Required Lenders, and such instructions of the Required Lenders and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all Lenders and any
other holder of all or any portion of the Loan or Participation therein.

     Section 7.03 Defaults. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
                  --------
knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or of an Event of Default unless
Administrative Agent has actual knowledge thereof or has received notice from a
Lender or Borrower specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that Administrative Agent has
such actual knowledge or receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default
or Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
Lenders. Administrative Agent shall promptly send to each Lender a copy of any
notice of a Default or Event of Default that Administrative Agent sends to
Borrower or Guarantor. Administrative Agent, following consultation with
Lenders, shall (subject to Section 7.07) take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default which is continuing, including with respect to the
exercise of remedies or the realization on, or operation or disposition of, any
or all of the Mortgaged Property or any other collateral for the Loan, as shall
be directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that, unless and until
                                     --------  -------
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent
may take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the best interest of
Lenders. In no event shall Administrative Agent be required to take any such
action which it determines to be contrary to the Loan Documents or to Law. Each
of Lenders acknowledges and agrees that no individual Lender may separately
enforce or exercise any of the provisions of any of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, the Notes) other than through Administrative
Agent.

     Section 7.04 Rights of Administrative Agent as Lender. With respect to its
                  ----------------------------------------
Note and interest in the Loan, Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as Administrative Agent,
and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include Administrative Agent in its
capacity as a Lender. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may (without
having to account therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to
(on a secured or unsecured basis), and

                                      54
<PAGE>

generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with, Borrower
or Guarantor (and any Affiliates of them) as if it were not acting as
Administrative Agent.

     Section 7.05 Sharing of Costs by Lenders; Indemnification of Administrative
                  --------------------------------------------------------------
Agent. Each Lender agrees to pay its ratable share, based on the respective
-----
outstanding principal balances under its Note and the other Notes, of any
reasonable expenses incurred (and not paid or reimbursed by Borrower after
demand for payment is made by Administrative Agent) by or on behalf of Lenders
in connection with any Default or Event of Default, including, without
limitation, costs of enforcement of the Loan Documents and any advances to pay
taxes or insurance premiums, to complete the Improvements or otherwise to
preserve the lien of the Mortgage or to preserve or protect the Mortgaged
Property. In the event a Lender fails to pay its share of expenses as aforesaid,
and all or a portion of such unpaid amount is paid by Administrative Agent
and/or one or more of the other Lenders, then the defaulting Lender shall
reimburse Administrative Agent and/or the other Lender(s) for the portion of
such unpaid amount paid by it or them, as the case may be, together with
interest thereon at the Prime Based Rate from the date of payment by
Administrative Agent and/or the other Lender(s). In addition, each Lender agrees
to reimburse and indemnify Administrative Agent (to the extent it is not paid by
on or behalf of Borrower, after demand for payment is made by Administrative
Agent, under Section 8.18 or under the applicable provisions of any other Loan
Document, but without limiting the obligation of Borrower under said Section
8.18 or such provisions), for such Lender's ratable share, based upon the
respective outstanding principal balances under its Note and the other Notes, of
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred to
herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without
limitation, the costs and expenses which Borrower is obligated to pay under
Section 8.18 or under the applicable provisions of any other Loan Document) or
the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other
documents or instruments; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for
                          --------  -------
(i) any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified or (ii) any loss of principal
or interest with respect to Administrative Agent's Note or interest in the Loan.

     Section 7.06 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
                  ------------------------------------------------------
Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on Administrative
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own analysis of the collateral for the Loan and of
the credit of Borrower and Guarantor, and its own decision to enter into this
Agreement, and that it will, independently and without reliance upon
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document. Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep
itself informed as to the performance or observance by Borrower of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or
<PAGE>

therein or to inspect the properties (including, without limitation, the
Premises) or books of Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents
and information expressly required to be furnished to Lenders by Administrative
Agent hereunder, Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility
to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the
affairs, financial condition or business of Borrower or Guarantor (or any
Affiliate of them) which may come into the possession of Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates. Administrative Agent shall not be required to file this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any document or instrument referred to
herein or therein, for record or give notice of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any document or instrument referred to herein or therein, to anyone.

     Section 7.07   Failure of Administrative Agent to Act. Except for action
                    --------------------------------------
expressly required of Administrative Agent hereunder, Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless
it shall have received reasonable further assurances (which may include cash
collateral) of the indemnification obligations of Lenders under Section 7.05 in
respect of any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. If any indemnity
furnished to Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the reasonable
opinion of Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired,
Administrative Agent may call for an additional indemnity and cease, or not
commence, the action indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished.

     Section 7.08   Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent.
                    ----------------------------------------------
Administrative Agent may resign on at least thirty (30) days' written notice to
Lenders and Borrower or upon the occurrence of an Event of Default; provided,
                                                                    --------
however, that, absent the occurrence of an Event of Default, Administrative
-------
Agent agrees not to resign prior to substantial completion of the Improvements.
Administrative Agent may be removed by the Required Lenders (i) with cause, at
any time and (ii) without cause, in the event (x) Administrative Agent fails to
maintain an Individual Loan Commitment of at least $10,000,000 or (y) if Commerz
is Administrative Agent, it has an Individual Loan Commitment that is smaller
than that of Fleet or HVB or is less than $10,000,000, provided that, in any
                                                       --------
such case, Borrower and the other Lenders shall be promptly notified thereof.
Upon such resignation or removal of Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which
successor Administrative Agent shall (provided there exists no Event of Default)
be subject to Borrower's approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within twenty
(20) days after the resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring
Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be one of
Lenders, within ten (10) days. The Required Lenders or the retiring
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall upon the appointment of a
successor Administrative Agent promptly so notify Borrower and the other
Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be

                                       56
<PAGE>

discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The retiring
Administrative Agent shall reasonably cooperate with such successor
Administrative Agent regarding the assumption of such duties. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Article VII shall continue in effect for its benefit in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
Administrative Agent. The periodic administration fee paid to the retiring
Administrative Agent pursuant to the Supplemental Fee Letter shall be deemed
earned by such retiring Administrative Agent only to the extent of the actual
days elapsed in the period to which such administration fee relates, and upon
appointment of a successor Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative
Agent shall pay to such successor a pro-rata portion of such periodic
administration fee based upon the number of days remaining in such period.

     Section 7.09  Amendments Concerning Agency Function. Notwithstanding
                   -------------------------------------
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Administrative Agent shall
not be bound by any waiver, amendment, supplement or modification of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document which affects its duties, rights, and/or
functions hereunder or thereunder unless it shall have given its prior written
consent thereto.

     Section 7.10  Liability of Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall
                   ---------------------------------
not have any liabilities or responsibilities to Borrower on account of the
failure of any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or to any Lender on
account of the failure of Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or under
any other Loan Document.

     Section 7.11  Transfer of Agency Function. Without the consent of Borrower
                   ---------------------------
or any Lender, Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time
transfer its functions as Administrative Agent hereunder to any of its offices
wherever located in the United States, provided that Administrative Agent shall
                                       --------
promptly notify Borrower and Lenders thereof.

     Section 7.12  Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative Agent; Adjustments.
                   ---------------------------------------------------------

     (a)  Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
or Borrower (either one as appropriate being the "Payor") prior to the date on
which such Lender is to make payment hereunder to Administrative Agent of Loan
proceeds or Borrower is to make payment to Administrative Agent, as the case may
be (either such payment being a "Required Payment"), which notice shall be
effective upon receipt, that the Payor will not make the Required Payment in
full to Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may assume that the Required
Payment has been made in full to Administrative Agent on such date, and
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to,
in reliance upon such assumption, make the amount thereof available to the
intended recipient on such date. If and to the extent the Payor shall not have
in fact so made the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, the
recipient of such payment shall repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such amount made available to it together with interest thereon, for each
day from the date such amount was so made available by Administrative Agent
until the date Administrative Agent recovers such amount, at the Federal Funds
Rate.

                                       57
<PAGE>

     (b)  If, after Administrative Agent has paid each Lender's share of any
payment received or applied by Administrative Agent in respect of the Loan, that
payment is rescinded or must otherwise be returned or paid over by
Administrative Agent, whether pursuant to any bankruptcy or insolvency Law,
sharing of payments clause of any loan agreement or otherwise, such Lender
shall, at Administrative Agent's request, promptly return its share of such
payment or application to Administrative Agent, together with such Lender's
proportionate share of any interest or other amount required to be paid by
Administrative Agent with respect to such payment or application. In addition,
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and
distributed by Administrative Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any
such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to Administrative
Agent its share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the
same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.

     Section 7.13  Withholding Taxes. Each Lender represents that it is entitled
                   -----------------
to receive any payments to be made to it hereunder without the withholding of
any tax and will furnish to Administrative Agent such forms, certifications,
statements and other documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request
from time to time to evidence such Lender's exemption from the withholding of
any tax imposed by any jurisdiction or to enable Administrative Agent to comply
with any applicable Laws relating thereto. Without limiting the effect of the
foregoing, if any Lender is not created or organized under the Laws of the
United States or any State thereof, such Lender will furnish to Administrative
Agent Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or such
other forms, certifications, statements or documents, duly executed and
completed by such Lender, as evidence of such Lender's complete exemption from
the withholding of United States tax with respect thereto. Administrative Agent
shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder to such Lender in respect
of the Loan until such Lender shall have furnished to Administrative Agent the
requested form, certification, statement or document.

     Section 7.14  Sharing of Payments among Lenders. If a Lender shall obtain
                   ---------------------------------
payment of any principal of its Note or of interest thereon through the exercise
of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or by any other means
(including direct payment), and such payment results in such Lender receiving a
greater payment than it would have been entitled to had such payment been paid
directly to Administrative Agent for disbursement to Lenders, then such Lender
shall promptly purchase for cash from the other Lenders Participations in the
Loan in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall
be equitable, to the end that all Lenders shall share ratably the benefit of
such payment. To such end Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among
themselves (by the resale of Participations sold or otherwise) if such payment
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.

     Section 7.15  Possession of Documents. Each Lender shall maintain
                   -----------------------
possession of its own Note. Administrative Agent shall hold all other Loan
Documents and related documents in its possession and maintain separate records
and accounts with respect to the Loan, reflecting the interests of Lenders in
the Loan, and shall permit

                                       58
<PAGE>

Lenders and their representatives access at all reasonable times to inspect such
Loan Documents, related documents, records and accounts.

     Section 7.16  Effect of a Lender's Failure to Make an Advance. In the event
                   -----------------------------------------------
any Lender fails for any reason to fund the portion it is required to fund of
any advance of Loan proceeds by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the second Business
Day after the date established by Administrative Agent as the date such advance
is to be made, such Lender shall be a "Delinquent Lender" for all purposes
hereunder until and unless such delinquency is cured in accordance with the
terms of and by the time permitted under Section 7.17, and the following
provisions shall apply:

          (a)  Administrative Agent shall notify (such notice being referred to
     as the "Delinquency Notice") each Lender and Borrower of any Lender's
     failure to fund. Each Non-Delinquent Lender shall have the right, but in no
     event or under any circumstance the obligation, to fund such Delinquent
     Lender's portion of such advance, provided that, within twenty (20) days of
                                       --------
     the date of the Delinquency Notice (the "Election Period"), such Non-
     Delinquent Lender or Lenders (each such Lender, an "Electing Lender")
     irrevocably commit(s) by notice in writing (an "Election Notice") to
     Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and Borrower to fund the Delinquent
     Lender's portion of the advance that is the subject of the delinquency and
     to assume the Delinquent Lender's obligations with respect to the advancing
     of the entire undisbursed portion of the Delinquent Lender's Individual
     Loan Commitment (such entire undisbursed portion of the Delinquent Lender's
     Individual Loan Commitment, including its portion of the advance that is
     the subject of the delinquency, the "Delinquency Amount"). If
     Administrative Agent receives more than one Election Notice within the
     Election Period, then the Electing Lenders sending such notices shall be
     deemed to have committed to fund ratable shares of the Delinquency Amount
     based upon the amounts of their respective Individual Loan Commitments. If
     there are one or more Electing Lenders and the Delinquent Lender fails to
     cure during the Election Period as provided in Section 7.17, then upon the
     expiration of the Election Period, each Electing Lender's Individual Loan
     Commitment shall be automatically increased by the Delinquency Amount (if
     there is only one Electing Lender) or such Electing Lender's ratable share,
     determined as aforesaid, of the Delinquency Amount (if there are two or
     more Electing Lenders), and the Delinquent Lender's Individual Loan
     Commitment shall automatically be reduced by the Delinquency Amount.
     Administrative Agent shall thereupon notify Borrower and each Lender of (i)
     the adjusted amounts of the Individual Loan Commitments and (ii) if the
     advance that was the subject of the delinquency was not made pursuant to
     Section 7.12 or was refunded by Borrower pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
     Section, the rescheduled date of such advance (which shall be no sooner
     than three (3) Business Days after such notice). In the event
     Administrative Agent shall have funded, pursuant to Section 7.12, the
     entire advance that was the subject of the delinquency (including the
     Delinquent Lender's portion), and Borrower shall not have refunded such
     advance pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Electing Lender(s)
     shall remit to Administrative Agent the Delinquent Lender's portion of the
     advance, or their ratable shares thereof, as the case may be, within three
     (3)

                                       59
<PAGE>

     Business Days of the notice provided for in the immediately preceding
     sentence, and Administrative Agent shall reimburse itself from such funds
     for making the Delinquent Lender's portion of the advance. Notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary contained herein, if Administrative Agent advances
     its own funds in respect of a Delinquent Lender's portion of an advance,
     Administrative Agent shall be entitled to the interest on the portion of
     the Principal Amount represented thereby, from the date Administrative
     Agent makes such advance until the date it is reimbursed therefor.

          (b)  In connection with the adjustment of the amounts of the
     Individual Loan Commitments of the Delinquent Lender and Electing Lender(s)
     upon the expiration of the Election Period as aforesaid, Borrower covenants
     that it shall, promptly following the request of the Electing Lender(s),
     execute and deliver to each Electing Lender and the Delinquent Lender
     substitute notes substantially in the form of EXHIBIT H and stating: "This
     Note is a substitute note as contemplated by Section 7.16 of the Loan
     Agreement; it replaces and is in lieu of that certain note made by Maker
     dated [date of Note] to the order of [Lender] in the principal sum of
     [Lender's original Individual Loan Commitment]." Such substitute notes
     shall be in amounts equal to such Lenders' respective Individual Loan
     Commitments, as adjusted. All such substitute notes shall constitute
     "Notes" and the obligations evidenced by such substitute notes shall be
     secured by the Mortgage. In connection with Borrower's execution of
     substitute notes as aforesaid, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative
     Agent such evidence of the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
     substitute notes and any related documents as Administrative Agent may
     reasonably request; provided that Borrower shall and be required to deliver
     a legal opinion in connection with the substitute notes. The execution and
     delivery of substitute notes as required above shall be a condition
     precedent to any further advances of Loan proceeds. Upon receipt of its
     substitute note, the Electing Lender and the Delinquent Lender will return
     to Borrower their notes that were replaced, provided that the delivery of a
                                                 --------
     substitute note to the Delinquent Lender pursuant to this Section 7.16
     shall operate to void and replace the note(s) previously held by the
     Delinquent Lender regardless of whether or not the Delinquent Lender
     returns same as required hereby. Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders
     shall execute such modifications to the Loan Documents as shall, in the
     reasonable judgment of Administrative Agent, be necessary or desirable in
     connection with the adjustment of the amounts of Individual Loan
     Commitments in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section.

          (c)  In the event that no Lender elects to commit to fund the
     Delinquency Amount within the Election Period as provided in paragraph (a)
     of this Section, Administrative Agent shall, upon the expiration of the
     Election Period, so notify Borrower and each Lender and the provisions of
     Section 2.09 shall apply.

          (d)  Subject to a Delinquent Lender's right to cure as provided in
     Section 7.17, but notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained
     in this

                                       60
<PAGE>

     Agreement, the Delinquent Lender's interest in, and any and all amounts due
     to a Delinquent Lender under, the Loan Documents (including, without
     limitation, all principal, interest, fees and expenses) shall be
     subordinate in lien priority and to the repayment of all amounts
     (including, without limitation, interest) then or thereafter due or to
     become due to the Non-Delinquent Lenders under the Loan Documents
     (including future advances) and the Delinquent Lender, after it becomes
     such, shall have no right to participate in any discussions among and/or
     decisions by Lenders hereunder and/or under the other Loan Documents.
     Further, subject to Section 7.17, any Delinquent Lender shall be bound by
     any amendment to, or waiver of, any provision of, or any action taken or
     omitted to be taken by Administrative Agent and/or the Non-Delinquent
     Lenders under, any Loan Document which is made subsequent to the Delinquent
     Lender's becoming a Delinquent Lender.

          (e)  If, pursuant to the operation of Section 7.12, an advance of Loan
     proceeds is made without Administrative Agent's receipt of a Delinquent
     Lender's portion thereof, in addition to Borrower's obligations under
     Section 7.12, Borrower shall, upon demand of Administrative Agent, refund
     the entire such advance to Administrative Agent. Borrower's failure to do
     so within ten (10) days of such demand shall, notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary contained herein or in the Mortgage, constitute an Event of
     Default under the Mortgage. Upon its receipt of such funds from Borrower,
     Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to each Non-Delinquent Lender its
     appropriate share thereof.

          Section 7.17  Cure by Delinquent Lender. A Delinquent Lender may cure
                        -------------------------
a delinquency arising out of its failure to fund its required portion of any
advance if, within the Election Period, it remits to Administrative Agent its
required portion of such advance (together with interest thereon at the Default
Rate from the date such advance was to have been made if such advance was made
by Administrative Agent and not refunded by Borrower pursuant to either Section
7.12 or paragraph (e) of Section 7.16), in which event Administrative Agent
shall so notify Borrower and the Non-Delinquent Lenders (i) of its receipt of
such funds and (ii)(A) if the advance that was the subject of the delinquency
shall not have been made (or shall have been refunded by Borrower pursuant to
paragraph (e) of Section 7.16), of the rescheduled date of the advance (which
shall be no sooner then three (3) Business Days after such notice) or (B) if
Administrative Agent shall have funded the entire advance that was the subject
of the delinquency (including the Delinquent Lender's portion) and Borrower
shall not have refunded such advance pursuant to paragraph (e) of Section 7.16,
of its intention to reimburse itself from funds received from the Delinquent
Lender (which reimbursement is hereby authorized) for funding the Delinquent
Lender's required portion of the advance. In the event any Delinquent Lender
cures a delinquency prior to the expiration of the Election Period (or
thereafter with the consent of all of the Non-Delinquent Lenders), such
Delinquent Lender nonetheless shall be bound by any amendment to or waiver of
any provision of, or any action taken or omitted to be taken by Administrative
Agent and/or the Non-Delinquent Lenders under, any Loan Document which is made
subsequent to that Lender's becoming a Delinquent Lender and prior to its curing
the delinquency as provided in this Section, provided that such amendment or
                                             --------
waiver of action was taken in

                                       61
<PAGE>

accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. A Delinquent Lender shall have
absolutely no right to cure any delinquency after the expiration of the Election
Period unless all Non-Delinquent Lenders, in their sole discretion, elect to
permit such cure.

     Section 7.18  Delinquent Lender Not Excused. Nothing contained in Sections
                   -----------------------------
7.16 or 7.17 shall release or in any way limit a Delinquent Lender's obligations
as a Lender hereunder and/or under any other of the Loan Documents. Further, a
Delinquent Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless Administrative Agent and
each of the Non-Delinquent Lenders from any claim, loss, or costs incurred by
Administrative Agent and/or the Non-Delinquent Lenders as a result of a
Delinquent Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any and all additional losses, damages, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred by
Administrative Agent and any Lender as a result of and/or in connection with (i)
a Non-Delinquent Lender's acting as an Electing Lender, (ii) any enforcement
action brought by Administrative Agent against a Delinquent Lender and (iii) any
action brought against Administrative Agent and/or Lenders. The indemnification
provided above shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

     Section 7.19  Notices Regarding Delinquent Lender. Notices by
                   -----------------------------------
Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to Sections 7.16 or 7.17 may be by
telephone (to be promptly confirmed in writing).

     Section 7.20  Replacement Lender. In the event any Lender becomes a
                   ------------------
Delinquent Lender and none of the other Lenders elects to be an Electing Lender
pursuant to Section 7.16, Borrower shall have the right, provided there exists
                                                         --------
no Default or Event of Default, to cause another financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Required Lenders to assume the Delinquent Lender's
obligations with respect to the Delinquency Amount on the then-existing terms
and conditions of the Loan Documents (such replacement institution, a
"Replacement Lender"). Such assumption shall be pursuant to a written instrument
reasonably satisfactory to the Required Lenders. Upon such assumption and the
payment by the Replacement Lender to Administrative Agent of a fee, for
Administrative Agent's own account, in the amount of $3,500, the Replacement
Lender shall become a "Lender" for all purposes hereunder, with an Individual
Loan Commitment in an amount equal to the Delinquency Amount, and the Delinquent
Lender's Individual Loan Commitment shall automatically be reduced by the
Delinquency Amount. In connection with the foregoing, Borrower shall execute and
deliver to the Replacement Lender and the Delinquent Lender replacement notes
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT H and stating: "This Note is a replacement
note as contemplated by Section 7.20 of the Loan Agreement; it replaces and is
in lieu of that certain note made by Maker dated [date of Note] to the order of
[Delinquent Lender] in the principal sum of [Delinquent Lender's original
Individual Loan Commitment]." Such replacement notes shall be in amounts equal
to, in the case of the Replacement Lender's note, the Delinquency Amount and, in
the case of the Delinquent Lender's note, its Individual Loan Commitment, as
reduced as aforesaid. Such replacement notes shall constitute "Notes" and the
obligations evidenced thereby shall be secured by the Mortgage. In connection
with Borrower's execution of replacement notes as aforesaid, Borrower shall
deliver to Administrative Agent such evidence of the due authorization,

                                       62
<PAGE>

execution and delivery of the replacement notes and any related documents as
Administrative Agent may reasonably request. If the Replacement Lender is not
incorporated under the Laws of the United States or a State thereof, it shall,
prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its
account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent certification as to
exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes in accordance with Section 7.13. The execution and delivery of replacement
notes as required above shall be a condition precedent to any further advances
of Loan proceeds. Upon receipt of its replacement note, the Delinquent Lender
will return to Borrower its note(s) that was replaced, provided that the
                                                       --------
delivery of a replacement note to the Delinquent Lender pursuant to this Section
7.20 shall operate to void and replace the note(s) previously held by the
Delinquent Lender regardless of whether or not the Delinquent Lender returns
same as required hereby.

     Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall execute such modifications
to the Loan Documents as shall, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative
Agent, be necessary or desirable in connection with the substitution of Lenders
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section.

Lenders shall reasonably cooperate with Borrower's attempts to obtain a
Replacement Lender, but they shall not be obligated to modify the Loan Documents
in connection therewith, other than modifications pursuant to the immediately
preceding paragraph.  As part of the first advance of Loan proceeds following
the admission of the Replacement Lender, the Replacement Lender shall advance to
Borrower, subject to the satisfaction of all conditions of this Agreement, an
amount equal to the Direct and Indirect Costs paid by Borrower pursuant to
clause (ii) of Section 2.09.

     Section 7.21   Special Provision Regarding Article VII. The provisions of
                    ---------------------------------------
this Article VII (other than Sections 7.08 and 7.20) are solely for the benefit
of Administrative Agent and Lenders. Borrower shall not have any right to rely
on or enforce any of such provisions (other than Sections 7.08 and 7.20), any of
which may be amended, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.11, without
Borrower's execution or consent.

     Section 7.22   Minimum Commitment by Agents. Notwithstanding the provisions
                    ----------------------------
of Section 8.12, each of Commerz, Fleet and HVB hereby agrees, so long as there
exists no Event of Default, that it will maintain an Individual Loan Commitment
in the amount of at least $ and further agrees to hold and not to participate or
assign any of such amount other than an assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank,
unless otherwise consented to by Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

     Section 7.23   Approval of Required Lenders. In all cases where the
                    ----------------------------
approval of the Required Lenders or all Lenders is required under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, Administrative Agent shall solicit from the
Required Lenders or Lenders such consent or approval and shall report to
Borrower whether such

                                       63
<PAGE>

consent or approval has been obtained, and Borrower shall have the right to rely
on such report by Administrative Agent.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                       GENERAL CONDITIONS AND PROVISIONS
                       ---------------------------------

     Section 8.01   Loan Balancing. If at any time Administrative Agent notifies
                    --------------
Borrower that, in Administrative Agent's sole judgment following consultation
with Borrower, the undisbursed balance of the Loan is insufficient to pay the
remaining Direct and Indirect Costs, Borrower shall, at its option, either (i)
within ten (10) days of Administrative Agent's notification as aforesaid,
deposit with Administrative Agent an amount equal to such deficiency, which
Administrative Agent may from time to time apply, or allow Borrower to apply, to
such Costs or (ii) pay for such Costs, as incurred, in the amount of such
deficiency so that the amount of the Loan which remains to be disbursed shall be
sufficient to pay all remaining Direct and Indirect Costs, and Borrower shall
furnish Administrative Agent with such evidence thereof as Administrative Agent
shall require. Borrower hereby agrees that Administrative Agent shall have a
lien on and security interest in, for the benefit of Lenders, any sums deposited
pursuant to clause (i) above and that Borrower shall have no right to withdraw
any such sums except for the payment of the aforesaid Costs as approved by
Administrative Agent. Lenders shall have no obligation to make any further
advances of proceeds of the Loan until the sums required to be deposited
pursuant to clause (i) above have been exhausted or until Borrower has actually
paid such Direct and Indirect Costs pursuant to clause (ii) above, as the case
may be, and, in either such case, the Loan is back "in balance". Any such sums
not used as provided in said clause (i) shall be released to Borrower when and
to the extent that Administrative Agent determines that the amount thereof is
more than the excess, if any, of the total remaining Costs of completion of the
Improvements over the undisbursed balance of the Loan; provided, however, that
                                                       --------  -------
should an Event of Default occur, Administrative Agent shall, at the option of
the Required Lenders, apply such amounts either to the Costs of completion of
the Improvements or to the immediate reduction of outstanding principal and/or
interest under the Notes.

     Section 8.02   Advance Not Waiver. Any advance of Loan proceeds hereunder
                    ------------------
made prior to or without the fulfillment by Borrower of all of the conditions
precedent thereto, whether or not known to Administrative Agent or Lenders,
shall not constitute a waiver by Administrative Agent or Lenders of the
requirement that all conditions, including the non-performed conditions, shall
be required with respect to all future advances.

     Section 8.03  No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for
                   ----------------------------
the benefit of Lenders, Administrative Agent and Borrower. All conditions of the
obligations of Lenders to make advances hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lenders and may be freely waived or modified in
whole or in part by Lenders at any time if in their sole discretion they deem it
advisable to do so, and no Person other than Borrower (provided, however, that
                                                       --------  -------
all conditions have been satisfied)

                                       64
<PAGE>

shall have standing to require Lenders to make any Loan advances or to be a
beneficiary of this Agreement or any advances to be made hereunder.

     Section 8.04   Authorization to Make Direct Advances. During the existence
                    -------------------------------------
of any Event of Default, Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Lenders to
advance any undisbursed Loan proceeds directly to the General Contractor, Major
Subcontractors and other Persons to pay for completion of the Improvements. All
such direct advances shall satisfy pro tanto the obligations of Lenders to
                                   --- -----
Borrower hereunder regardless of the disposition thereof by the General
Contractor, any Major Subcontractor or other Person.

     Section 8.05   Authorization to Advance for Interest. Borrower hereby
                    -------------------------------------
irrevocably authorizes Lenders to disburse proceeds of the Loan to pay interest
accrued on the Notes as it comes due, or (if Borrower fails to pay the same
within five (5) Business Days after notice by Administrative Agent of the same)
to pay any fees or expenses required to be paid by Borrower under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment of the fees and expenses
of Lenders' Counsel and the Construction Consultant.

     Section 8.06   Concerning Irrevocable Authorizations. Any and all advances
                    -------------------------------------
made at any time by Lenders pursuant to the irrevocable authorizations granted
by Sections 8.04 and 8.05 shall require no further direction, authorization or
request for disbursement from Borrower and, except in the case of advances under
Section 8.04, may be made whether or not there exists a Default or Event of
Default. Any and all such disbursements shall be added to the outstanding
principal balance evidenced by the Notes and shall be secured by the Mortgage.
The aforesaid authorizations shall (i) not prevent Borrower from paying the
contractors and other Persons, from paying the interest, or from satisfying the
conditions and obligations referred to in said Sections, out of its own funds,
(ii) in no event be construed so as to relieve Borrower or others from their
obligations to pay such contractors or other Persons, to pay interest as and
when due under the Notes, or to satisfy such conditions and obligations and
(iii) in no event obligate Lenders to disburse proceeds of the Loan for any such
purposes.

     Section 8.07   Ratification of Requisition by Acceptance of Advance. By its
                    ----------------------------------------------------
acceptance of any advance of Loan proceeds hereunder, Borrower shall be bound in
all respects by the Requisition submitted on its behalf in connection therewith
with the same force and effect as if Borrower had itself executed and submitted
the Requisition and whether or not the Requisition is executed and/or submitted
by an authorized Person.

     Section 8.08   Documentation Etc. Satisfactory. All documentation and
                    -------------------------------
proceedings deemed by Administrative Agent or Lenders' Counsel to be necessary
or required in connection herewith and the documents relating hereto shall be
subject to the prior approval of, and satisfactory to, both of them as to form
and substance. In addition, the Persons responsible for the execution and
delivery of, and signatories to, all of such documentation, shall be reasonably
acceptable to, and subject to the reasonable approval of, Administrative Agent
and Lenders' Counsel. Administrative Agent or Lenders' Counsel shall receive
copies, certified if requested by either of them, of all documents

                                       65
<PAGE>

which they may reasonably require in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     Section 8.09   Administrative Agent's Determination Conclusive.
                    -----------------------------------------------
Administrative Agent shall, at all times, be free to independently establish to
its satisfaction and in its absolute discretion (vis-a-vis Borrower) the
                                                 --- - ---
existence or nonexistence of any fact or facts the existence or nonexistence of

     Section 8.11   Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or material waiver of
                    ----------------------
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any
material departure by Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party against
whom such amendment, waiver or consent is sought to be enforced (it being
understood, however, that the signatures of the Required Lenders and, solely for
purposes of its acknowledgement thereof, Administrative Agent, shall be
necessary and sufficient to bind Lenders to any such amendment, waiver or
consent), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,
                                                                --------
however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
-------
signed by all Lenders (subject, however, to the provisions of Section 7.16(d)),
do any of the following: (i) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes
or any fees due hereunder or any other amount due hereunder or under any other
Loan Document; (ii) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees due hereunder or under any other Loan
Document; (iii) change the definition of Required Lenders; (iv) release any
material portion of the Mortgaged Property or other collateral for the Loan
other than in accordance with the Loan Documents; (v) amend this Section or any
other provision requiring the consent of all Lenders; (vi) release, in whole or
in part, Guarantor other than in accordance with the Loan Documents; or (vii)
increase the Loan Amount. Without limiting the foregoing, acceptance by
Administrative Agent or Lenders of any sum required to be paid pursuant hereto
or to any other Loan Document, after its due date, or in an amount less than the
sum then due, shall not constitute a waiver by Administrative Agent or Lenders
of their right to require prompt payment when due of all other such sums or to
declare a default or to exercise such other rights provided herein or in the
other Loan Documents for such late or reduced payment.

     All communications from Administrative Agent to Lenders requesting Lenders'
determination, consent, approval or disapproval (i) shall be given in the form
of a written notice to each Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by or include a
description or copy of the matter or thing as to which such determination,
approval, consent or disapproval is requested and (iii) shall include
Administrative Agent's recommended course of action or determination in respect
thereof.  Each Lender shall reply promptly, but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days (or five (5) Business Days with respect to any decision to
accelerate or stop acceleration of the Loan) after receipt of the request
therefor by Administrative Agent (the "Lender Reply Period"), subject to the
shorter period required by Section 6.02 regarding lease approvals.  Unless a
Lender shall give written notice to Administrative Agent that it objects to the
recommendation or determination of Administrative Agent (together with a written
explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within the Lender Reply
Period, such Lender shall be deemed to have approved or consented to such
recommendation or determination.

     Section 8.12  Assignment; Participation. Any Non-Delinquent Lender may at
                   -------------------------
any time grant to one or more banks or other institutions (each, a
"Participant") participating interests in its Pro Rata Share of the Loan (each,
a "Participation"), provided that any such Participation shall be in the minimum
amount of $5,000,000. In the event of any such grant by a Lender of a
Participation to a Participant, such Lender shall remain responsible for the
performance of its obligations hereunder, and Borrower and Administrative Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations hereunder.

     Upon request, each Lender agrees to provide Borrower and Administrative
Agent with notice of all Participations sold by such Lender. Borrower agrees to
provide all assistance reasonably requested by a Lender to enable such Lender to
sell Participations as aforesaid, or make assignments of its interest in the
Loan as hereinafter provided in this Section.

     A Lender may at any time assign to (x) an Eligible Assignee with the
consent of Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, (y) any bank or other institution with the consent of
Administrative Agent and, provided there exists no Default or Event of Default,
of Borrower, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or (z)
one or more banks or other institutions which are Affiliates of a Lender (for
purposes of this paragraph, an Affiliate of a Lender shall include any financing
conduit or special purpose entity created to issue securities which are backed,
in part, by the Loan) (each such assignee under clauses (x), (y) or (z) above,
an "Assignee") all or a proportionate part of all of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement and its Note, and such Assignee shall assume rights and
obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement executed by such
Assignee and the assigning Lender, provided that, after giving effect to such
                                   --------
assignment, in each case, the Assignee's portion of the Loan and, in the case of
a partial assignment of a Lender's interest, the assigning Lender's portion of
the Loan will each be equal to or greater than $5,000,000.  Upon (i) execution
and delivery of such instrument, (ii) payment by such Assignee to the assigning
Lender of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such Lender and
such Assignee and (iii) in cases other than assignments to an

                                       67
<PAGE>

Affiliate of a Lender, payment by such Assignee to Administrative Agent of a
fee, for Administrative Agent's own account, in the amount of $3,500, such
Assignee shall be a party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and
obligations of a Lender as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, and the assigning Lender shall be released from its obligations
hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by any
party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to
this paragraph, substitute notes, in the form of EXHIBIT H, shall be issued to
the assigning Lender (in the case of a partial assignment) and Assignee by
Borrower, in exchange for the return of the assigning Lender's original Note.
All such substitute notes shall constitute "Notes" and the obligations evidenced
by such substitute notes shall constitute obligations secured by the Mortgage.
In connection with Borrower's execution of substitute notes as aforesaid,
Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent such evidence of the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the substitute notes and any related
documents as Administrative Agent may reasonably request. If the Assignee is not
incorporated under the Laws of the United States or a state thereof, it shall,
prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its
account, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent certification as to
exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes in accordance with Section 7.13.

     Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall execute such modifications
to the Loan Documents as shall, in the reasonable judgment of Administrative
Agent, be necessary or desirable in connection with assignments in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section.  Borrower agrees to provide all
assistance reasonably requested by a Lender to enable such Lender to sell
Participations or make assignments of its interest in the Loan as provided in
this Section, provided, however, that Borrower shall not incur any unreasonable
              --------  -------
cost or expense in connection therewith.

     Any Lender may at any time freely assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank, central bank or
other applicable regulatory authority, whether as collateral or otherwise.  No
such assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations
hereunder.

     Borrower recognizes that in connection with a Lender's selling of
Participations or making of assignments, any or all documentation, financial
statements, appraisals and other data, or copies thereof, relevant to Borrower,
Guarantor or the Loan may be exhibited to and retained by any such Participant
or Assignee or prospective Participant or Assignee.  A Lender's delivery of any
financial statements and appraisals to any such Participant or Assignee or
prospective Participant or Assignee shall be done on a confidential basis.

     Section 8.13   Setoff. In addition to (and without limitation of) any right
                    ------
of setoff, bankers' lien or counterclaim Administrative Agent or any Lender may
otherwise have, Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled, but only
with the prior consent of the Required Lenders and after consultation with
Lenders' Counsel, to offset balances (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) held by it for the account of Borrower at any of
Administrative Agent's or such Lender's offices against any amount payable by
Borrower to Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder or

                                       68
<PAGE>

under any other Loan Document which is not paid when due (regardless of whether
such balances are then due to Borrower), in which case it shall promptly notify
Borrower and (in the case of a Lender) Administrative Agent thereof; provided,
                                                                     --------
however, that Administrative Agent's or such Lender's failure to give such
-------
notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

     Section 8.14   Successors and Assigns. Except as herein provided, this
                    ----------------------
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower,
Administrative Agent and Lenders and their respective heirs, personal
representatives, successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower
may not assign, transfer or set over to another, in whole or in part, all or any
part of its benefits, rights, duties and obligations hereunder, including, but
not limited to, performance of and compliance with conditions hereof and the
right to receive the proceeds of current or future advances.

     Section 8.15   Severability. The provisions hereof are intended to be
                    ------------
severable. Any provisions hereof, or the application thereof to any Person or
circumstance, which, for any reason, in whole or in part, is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof (or the remaining portions of such provision) or the
application thereof to any other Person or circumstance, and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision (or portion thereof) or the application
thereof to any Person or circumstance in any other jurisdiction.

     Section 8.16   Non-Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on
                    -------------------------------
Administrative Agent's or any Lender's part in exercising any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents or
provided by law (hereinafter in this Section, each a "Remedy") shall operate as
a waiver of any such Remedy or shall be deemed to constitute Administrative
Agent's or any Lender's acquiescence in any default by Borrower or Guarantor
under any of said documents. A waiver by Administrative Agent or any Lender of
any Remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any other or
future exercise thereof or of any other Remedy. The Remedies are cumulative, may
be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other Remedies.

     Section 8.17   Certain Waivers. Borrower hereby irrevocably and
                    ---------------
unconditionally waives (i) promptness and diligence, (ii) notice of any actions
taken by Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or any other agreement or instrument relating hereto or thereto except
to the extent otherwise provided herein, (iii) all other notices, demands and
protests, and all other formalities of every kind in connection with the
enforcement of Borrower's obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, the omission of or delay in which, but for the provisions of this
Section, might constitute grounds for relieving Borrower of any of its
obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (iv) any requirement
that Administrative Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any
lien on any collateral for the Loan or exhaust any right or take any action
against Borrower, Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral for
the Loan, (v) any right or

                                       69
<PAGE>

claim of right to cause a marshalling of Borrower's assets and (vi) all rights
of subrogation or contribution, whether arising by contract or operation of law
or otherwise by reason of payment by Borrower pursuant hereto or to any other
Loan Document. BORROWER FURTHER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES,
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR LENDERS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR
OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THE LOAN, ANY AND EVERY RIGHT BORROWER MAY HAVE TO (W)
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, (X) A TRIAL BY JURY, (Y) INTERPOSE ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN,
OTHER THAN A COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM, AND (Z) HAVE THE SAME CONSOLIDATED WITH
ANY OTHER OR SEPARATE SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL PREVENT OR PROHIBIT BORROWER FROM
INSTITUTING OR MAINTAINING A SEPARATE ACTION AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR
LENDERS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ASSERTED CLAIM.

     Section 8.18   Expenses; Indemnification. Borrower covenants and agrees to
                    -------------------------
pay all costs, expenses and charges (including, without limitation, all fees and
charges of engineers, appraisers, environmental and insurance consultants, the
Construction Consultant and Lenders' Counsel) incurred by Agents or any Lender
in connection with (i) the preparation for and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or for the performance hereof and of the other Loan
Documents, and for any services which may be required in addition to those
normally and reasonably contemplated hereby and (ii) the enforcement hereof or
of any or all of the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that Borrower
                                           --------  -------
shall not be responsible for (1) the fees and expenses of legal counsel for
Lenders (other than Lenders' Counsel) incurred in connection with said counsel's
review of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents prior to execution and (2)
costs, expenses and charges incurred by Agents and Lenders in connection with
the administration or syndication of the Loan (other than the syndication costs
and expenses and the administration fees required by the Supplemental Fee Letter
and the fees and expenses of Lenders' Counsel and the Construction Consultant).
In connection with the foregoing, Lenders agree, to the extent practicable, to
appoint a single counsel and local counsel, selected by Administrative Agent, to
act on behalf of all Lenders in connection with the enforcement of the Loan
Documents. If Borrower fails to pay promptly any costs, charges or expense
required to be paid by it as aforesaid, and any Agent or any Lender pays such
costs, charges or expenses, Borrower shall reimburse such Agent or Lender, as
appropriate, on demand for the amounts so paid, together with interest thereon
at the Default Rate. Borrower further agrees to indemnify each Agent and each
Lender and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and
hold each of them harmless against, (x) any and all losses arising out of or by
reason of any investigation or litigation or other proceedings (including any
threatened investigation or litigation or other proceedings) relating to any
actual or proposed use by Borrower of the proceeds of the Loan, including,
without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection
with any such investigation, litigation or other proceedings and (y) any and all
claims, actions, suits, proceedings, costs, expenses, losses, damages and
liabilities of any kind, including in tort, penalties and interest, arising out
or by reason of any matter

                                       70
<PAGE>

relating, directly or indirectly, to the Mortgage or the ownership, condition,
development, construction, sale, rental or financing of the Premises or
Improvements or any part thereof (but excluding any such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses incurred solely by reason of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified). The obligations of Borrower
under this Section and under Sections 3.01, 3.03 and 6.07 shall survive the
repayment of all amounts due under or in connection with any of the Loan
Documents and the termination of the Individual Loan Commitments.

     Section 8.19   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
                    ------------
of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument, and any party hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such
counterpart.

     Section 8.20   Lenders' Right to Terminate. In the event Borrower shall not
                    ---------------------------
have satisfied the conditions precedent to its entitlement to advances of Loan
proceeds hereunder within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date hereof, the
Required Lenders shall have the absolute right, at their option, to terminate
Lenders' obligations to Borrower under this Agreement and the loan commitment
represented hereby; provided, however, that Borrower may extend such date by up
                    --------  -------
to three (3) periods of thirty (30) days each, upon payment to Administrative
Agent, for the account of Lenders, on the first day of each such thirty (30)-day
period, of an extension fee in an amount equal to, in each case, 0.041667% of
each Lender's Individual Loan Commitment. Each such fee shall be non-refundable
once paid. In the event of such termination, the Required Lenders shall direct
Administrative Agent to send notice thereof to the other Lenders and Borrower.

     Section 8.21   Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement and the rights
                    ---------------------------
and obligations of the parties hereunder shall in all respects be governed by,
and construed and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to New York's principles of conflicts of law). Borrower,
Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby irrevocably submit to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal court sitting in The
City of New York (or any county in New York State where any portion of the
Mortgaged Property is located) over any suit, action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, and Borrower hereby agrees and consents that,
in addition to any methods of service of process provided for under applicable
Law, all service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding in any New
York State or Federal court sitting in The City of New York (or such other
county in New York State) may be made by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, directed to Borrower at the address indicated on the
signature page hereof, and service so made shall be complete five (5) days after
the same shall have been so mailed.

     Section 8.22   Integration. The Loan Documents and the Supplemental Fee
                    -----------
Letter constitute the entire agreement among Administrative Agent, Borrower and
Lenders relating to the transactions contemplated thereby (except with respect
to agreements among Lenders or with Administrative Agent relating solely to
compensation, consideration and the syndication of the Loan) and supersede any
prior oral or written statements or agreements with respect to such
transactions.

     Section 8.23   Gross-Up For Taxes. All payments made by Borrower under this
                    ------------------
Agreement and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority, excluding income taxes and franchise or other taxes
(imposed in lieu of income taxes) imposed on a Lender as a result of a present
or former connection between such Lender and the jurisdiction of the
Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from
such Lender's having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or
received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or its Note). If any such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") is required to be withheld from any amounts
payable to such Lender hereunder or under its Note, the amounts so payable to
such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Lender
(after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts
payable with respect to the Loan at the rates or in the amounts specified in
this Agreement and its Note; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be
                             --------  -------
required to increase any such amounts payable to such Lender if such Lender is
not organized under the Laws of the United States or a State thereof and such
Lender fails to comply with the requirements of Section 7.13. Whenever any Non-
Excluded Taxes are payable by Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter
Borrower shall send to Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender a
certified copy of an original official receipt received by Borrower showing
payment thereof. If Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the
appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to Administrative Agent the
required receipts or other required documentary evidence, Borrower shall
indemnify such Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may
become payable by such Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in
this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of
the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

     Section 8.24   Partial Releases. Provided there exists no Default or Event
                    ----------------
of Default, Administrative Agent shall release the lien and effect of the
Mortgage from portions of the Premises (each such portion of the Premises, a
"Release Parcel") as follows:

          (i)  All such releases shall be subject, in each case, to Borrower's
     compliance with the provisions of Section 8.25, if applicable, and to
     Administrative Agent's receipt of (A) evidence that the balance of the
     Premises complies with all applicable zoning and other Laws, (B) an
     endorsement to the title insurance policy for the Mortgage insuring that
     (x) the Mortgage will in no way be impaired by virtue of the release of the
     Release Parcel and (y) the subdivision of the Release Parcel has been
     validly effected and the balance of the Premises constitutes a separate tax
     and zoning lot, (C) a current survey of the Premises, specifically
     delineating the Release Parcel, certified to Administrative Agent and the
     Title Insurer, (D) such other documents (including, without limitation,
     easement agreements), opinions and assurances as Administrative Agent or
     Lenders' Counsel may reasonably request (all of the foregoing items (A)

                                       72
<PAGE>

     through (D) to be received by Administrative Agent at least ten (10)
     Business Days prior to the proposed release and be in form and substance
     reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Lenders' Counsel), (E)
     the appropriate release price, if any, required by subparagraph (iv) below,
     to be applied by Administrative Agent to the repayment of the Principal
     Amount and accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (F) payment of a $5,000
     processing fee to Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent's out-of-
     pocket expenses, including attorneys' fees and expenses, in connection
     therewith.

          (ii)   The Excess Land shall be released, upon Borrower's written
     request, as provided in subparagraph (i) above. Borrower covenants that if
     the Excess Land is developed as part of the second phase of the overall
     project of which the Improvements are a part (the "Phase II Development"),
     such development shall be done generally in accordance with the conceptual
     plans therefor submitted to Agents prior to the date hereof.

          (iii)  Portions of the Premises (other than the Excess Land) shall be
     released, upon Borrower's written request, as provided in subparagraph (i)
     above, and provided, further, that Administrative Agent shall have
                --------  -------
     determined (which determination shall be conclusive so long as made on a
     reasonable basis) that (A) Guarantor is in compliance with the covenants
     set forth in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Payment Guaranty, (B) the then
     Commitment Amount does not exceed (x) 65%, until such time as 25% of the
     Premises (exclusive of the Excess Land), as determined on the basis of
     Allocated Amounts, has been released as provided herein and (y) 60%,
     thereafter, in each case of the "stabilized" value of those portions of the
     Premises remaining subject to the Mortgage, exclusive of the Excess Land
     (as reflected in an update to the appraisal delivered pursuant to Section
     4.01(a)(4), which updated appraisal shall be commissioned by Administrative
     Agent at Borrower's expense) and (C) Debt Service Coverage in respect of
     those portions of the Premises remaining subject to the Mortgage (taking
     into account the release price paid pursuant to subparagraph (iv) below)
     will be equal to or greater than the Debt Service Coverage which existed
     immediately prior to the release; provided, however, that the foregoing
                                       --------  -------
     loan-to-value and Debt Service Coverage conditions set forth in clauses (B)
     and (C) above shall be deemed satisfied if Borrower either (x) makes a
     partial prepayment of the Principal Amount no later than five (5) Business
     Days prior to the date of the release in an amount such that the requisite
     loan-to-value and Debt Service Coverage, each recomputed based on the
     reduced Commitment Amount, are attained or (y) delivers to Administrative
     Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, additional collateral for the payment
     and performance of Borrower's obligations under the Loan in the form of (I)
     cash, (II) an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit issued to
     Administrative Agent by a financial institution having a credit rating of A
     or better by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. (or its equivalent by another
     nationally recognized rating agency) and reasonably acceptable to
     Administrative Agent and having an expiration date no earlier than one (1)
     month subsequent to the Maturity Date or (III) marketable securities or
     other collateral, in each case in an amount sufficient (assuming such
     additional collateral were

                                       73
<PAGE>

     applied in reduction of the Principal Amount) to cause the requisite loan-
     to-value and Debt Service Coverage to be attained. Any cash collateral
     delivered to Administrative Agent pursuant to this subparagraph (iii) shall
     be deposited into an interest-bearing "blocked" cash collateral account to
     be established with and held in the name of Administrative Agent. Any
     additional collateral delivered pursuant to this subparagraph (iii) shall
     be satisfactory, in form and substance, to Administrative Agent and the
     collateral value thereof, other than in the cases of cash or letters of
     credit, for purposes of this subparagraph, shall be conclusively determined
     by Administrative Agent. Borrower hereby assigns any such account and all
     sums therein, including earnings thereon, and any other additional
     collateral delivered pursuant hereto, to Administrative Agent, for the
     benefit of Lenders, as security for the Loan. Borrower acknowledges and
     agrees that Administrative Agent shall receive and retain possession of all
     documents or instruments constituting or evidencing any such additional
     collateral to perfect its security interests therein. At any time following
     the occurrence of an Event of Default, Administrative Agent may, upon the
     direction of the Required Lenders, apply any and all such additional
     collateral, including earnings thereon, to the immediate reduction of the
     Principal Amount and/or accrued and unpaid interest and/or other sums
     payable hereunder or under the Notes or other Loan Documents, in such order
     and amounts as the Required Lenders shall elect. Administrative Agent is
     hereby appointed Borrower's attorney-in-fact for the purpose of so dealing
     with any additional collateral delivered pursuant hereto. Borrower agrees
     to execute such further documents (including security agreements and UCC-1
     financing statements) and do such further acts as Administrative Agent may
     reasonably request to confirm or perfect the assignment and security
     interests provided for in this subparagraph.

          (iv) As a condition to releases of Release Parcels pursuant to
     subparagraph (iii) above, Borrower shall be required to pay a release price
     in an amount equal to 115% of the Allocated Amount therefor, together with
     all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. No release price shall be required
     for releases of Release Parcels pursuant to subparagraph (ii) above.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if pursuant to
the foregoing provisions, the release of a Release Parcel under subparagraph
(iii) above and the application of the appropriate release price therefor
results in a  reduction of the Commitment Amount to $100,000,000 or less, then,
within ten (10) days of Administrative Agent's request made at the direction of
the Required Lenders, Borrower shall, and hereby covenants and promises to,
repay the entire Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
and all other sums due to Lenders or Administrative Agent in connection with the
Loan, in full.  Upon any such request by Administrative Agent, Borrower's
entitlement to further advances of the Loan Amount, and Lenders' respective
obligations to make such further advances, shall automatically terminate.

     Section 8.25  Special Provisions Regarding Financing of Phase II
                   --------------------------------------------------
Development.
-----------

     (a)  In the event that Borrower intends to proceed with the Phase II
Development (either directly or through an Affiliate) and to obtain third-party
financing in connection therewith, Borrower shall so notify Agents, which notice
shall include a reasonably detailed description of the Phase II Development and
the estimated costs thereof. Agents shall have a period (the "Agents' Response
Period") of thirty (30) days following their receipt of such notice (and such
supporting information as they may reasonably request within fifteen (15) days
after their receipt of such notice) within which to make a detailed proposal to
finance the Phase II Development.

     (b)  If Agents fail to make a proposal to finance the Phase II Development
within such time period, Borrower or Borrower's Affiliate shall have the right
to seek such financing from other third-party sources.

     (c)  In those cases where Agents make a proposal to finance the Phase II
Development, as contemplated by paragraph (a) above, and, after good faith
consideration of Agents' proposal, Borrower or Borrower's Affiliate does not
accept the same, Borrower or Borrower's Affiliate shall have the right to seek
such financing from other third-party sources and to close the same. If Borrower
opts to close other third-party financing of the Phase II Development in
accordance with this paragraph (c), Borrower shall, at the time of or prior to
the closing of such other third-party financing, convey to an Affiliate of
Borrower the land on which the Phase II Development is to be constructed, it
being understood that in no event shall Borrower undertake in its own name the
Phase II Development with such other third-party financing.

     (d)  The right of first offer described in this Section shall terminate
automatically without notice, and shall be of no force and effect, upon the
repayment of all sums owing by Borrower in connection with the Loan and the
termination of the lending commitments hereunder.

     (e)  Borrower covenants that the Phase II Development shall be undertaken
generally in accordance with the conceptual plans therefor submitted to Agents
prior to the date hereof.

     elected, appointed or controlled by Borrower or its Affiliates;

          (d)  Administrative Agent shall have received an opinion from

                    ---------------------------------------------
the date hereof, fee title to the Ground Lease Parcel will be acquired by FRIT
LLC from the landlord under the Ground Lease in a transaction which will also
involve the simultaneous (i) termination of the Ground Lease and (ii) repayment

shall be advanced for such purpose. Borrower hereby notifies Administrative
Agent that the closing of such transaction is scheduled for October 12, 2001. In
the event an earlier closing date is triggered by notice to FRIT LLC by the

releasing/reconveying the FRIT Deed of Trust and confirming that the Mortgage
encumbers the fee interest in the Ground Lease Parcel free of the Ground Lease,
the FRIT Deed of Trust and related encumbrances as Administrative Agent may
reasonably request. Upon such delivery and provided the Title Insurer is
irrevocably and unconditionally committed to issue an endorsement to the title
policy insuring the Mortgage which removes the Ground Lease, the FRIT Deed of
Trust and related encumbrances as exceptions to title and adds the fee interest
in the Ground Lease Parcel to the insured premises thereunder without exceptions
other than those shown on the title policy issued to Administrative Agent at the
closing of the Loan and such additional exceptions as may be approved by
Administrative Agent, (x) Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of Lenders,
execute and deliver a release of SRI, in form reasonably acceptable to SRI,
releasing SRI from any and all liability under the Loan Documents and (y)
Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to Borrower a termination of the

and in respect of which all representations, warranties, covenants and
conditions herein shall apply. Borrower covenants, promptly upon the execution
and procurement of, respectively, Plans, construction contracts and permits and
authorizations, to deliver the same to Agents and the Construction Consultant
and to otherwise comply with the provisions of this Agreement with respect
