      deemed to have been automatically given upon the occurrence of a Default
      or an Event of Default under Section 9.05 or upon the exercise of any of
      the remedies provided in the last paragraph of Section 9), in which case
      a Borrowing or Borrowings of Revolving Loans, as the case may be, constituting
      Base Rate Loans (each such Borrowing or Borrowings, collectively, a &#147;Mandatory
      Borrowing&#148;) shall be made on the immediately succeeding Business Day
      by all Revolver Lenders pro rata based on each Revolver Lender&#146;s Dollar
      Percentage, and the proceeds thereof shall be applied directly to repay
      Fleet for such outstanding Swingline Loans. Each Revolver Lender hereby
      irrevocably agrees to make Revolving Loans upon one Business Day&#146;s
      notice pursuant to each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner
      specified in the preceding sentence and on the date specified in writing
      by Fleet notwithstanding (i) that the amount of the Mandatory Borrowing
      may not comply with the Minimum Borrowing Amount otherwise required hereunder,
      (ii) whether any conditions specified in Section 5 are then satisfied, (iii)
      whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
      (iv) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing and (v) the amount of, or termination
      of, the Total Revolving Commitment at such time. In the event that any Mandatory
      Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above
      (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding
      under the Bankruptcy Code in respect of Workflow), each Revolver Lender
      (other than Fleet) hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of
      the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted
      for any payments received from Workflow on or after such date and prior
      to such purchase) from Fleet such participations in the outstanding Swingline
      Loans as shall be necessary to cause such Revolver Lenders to share in such
      Swingline Loans ratably based upon their respective Dollar Percentages,
      <u>provided</u> that (x) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans shall
      be for the account of Fleet until the date as of which the respective participation
      is required to be purchased and, to the extent attributable to the purchased
      participation, shall be payable to the participant from and after such date
      and (y) at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to this sentence
      is actually made, the purchasing Revolver Lender shall be required to pay
      Fleet interest on the principal amount of the participation purchased for
      each day from and including the day upon which the respective participation

      Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Fleet as Agent of
      such Lender (such term to include for purposes of this Section 11, Fleet
      acting as Collateral Agent) to act as specified herein and in the other
      Credit Documents, and each such Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Fleet
      as the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
      Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to exercise such powers and
      perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the terms
      of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, together with such other
      powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent agrees to act as
      such upon the express conditions contained in this Section 11. Notwithstanding
      any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other
      Credit Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
      except those expressly set forth herein or in the other Credit Documents,
      or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants,
      functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be
      read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent. The Agent
      is nevertheless a &#147;representative&#148; of the Lenders, as that term
      is defined in Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of
      actions for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent with respect to all
      collateral security and guaranties contemplated by the Credit Documents.
      Such actions include the designation of the Agent as &#147;secured party&#148;,
      &#147;mortgagee&#148; or the like on all financing statements and other
      documents and instruments, whether recorded or otherwise, relating to the
      attachment, perfection, priority or enforcement of any security interests,
      mortgages or deeds of trust in collateral security intended to secure the
      payment or performance of any of the Obligations, all for the benefit of
      the Lenders and the Agent. The provisions of this Section 11 are solely
      for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor
      any of its Subsidiaries shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary
      of any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties
      under this Agreement, the Agent shall act solely as agent of the Lenders
      and the Agent shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship
      of agency or trust with or for the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
      In addition to the foregoing powers, each Lender hereby expressly authorizes
      the Agent and the Collateral Agent to amend or to amend and restate each
      of the &#147;Security Documents&#148; as defined in the Existing Credit
      Agreement to the extent that such Security Documents are amended or amended

      determining the Required Lenders at such time, from and against any and
      all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
      suits, costs, reasonable expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever
      which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following
      the payment of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
      the Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out
      of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or any documents contemplated
      by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any
      action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent under or in connection
      with any of the foregoing, but only to the extent that any of the foregoing
      is not paid by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that no
      Lender shall be liable to the Agent for the payment of any portion of such
      liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
      suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the gross
      negligence or willful misconduct of such Person (as finally determined by
      a court of competent jurisdiction). To the extent any Lender would be required
      to indemnify the Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence but
      for the fact that it is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall
      not be entitled to receive any portion of any payment or other distribution
      hereunder until each other Lender shall have been reimbursed for the excess,
      if any, of the aggregate amount paid by such Lender under this Section 11.07
      over the aggregate amount such Lender would have been obligated to pay had
      such first Lender not been a Defaulting Lender. If any indemnity furnished
      to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Person be insufficient
      or become impaired, such Person may call for additional indemnity and cease,
      or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional
      indemnity is furnished. The agreements in this Section 11.07 shall survive

      Lender executing an Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially in
      the form of Exhibit K, appropriately completed (each, an &#147;Assignment

      to this Section 12.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its
      obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Revolving Commitment
      and Term Loans. At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section

      not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30)

      in increased costs under Sections 1.11, 2.05 or 4.04 from those being charged
      by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then Workflow
      shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although Workflow, in

      agent, solely for purposes of this Section 12.17, to maintain a register
      (the &#147;Register&#148;) on which it will record the Revolving Commitments,
      Term A Loan Commitments and Term B Loan Commitments from time to time of
      each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment
      in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. Failure
      to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not
      affect the Borrower&#146;s obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect
      to any Lender, the transfer of the Revolving Commitments, Term A Loan Commitments
      and Term B Loan Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal
      of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Revolving Commitments,
      Term A Loan Commitments or Term B Loan Commitments shall not be effective
      until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Agent
      with respect to ownership of such Revolving Commitments, Term A Loan Commitments,
      Term B Loan Commitments and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts
      owing to the transferor with respect to such Revolving Commitments and Loans
      shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or
      transfer of all or part of any Revolving Commitments, Term A Loan Commitments,
      Term B Loan Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Agent on the
      Register only upon the acceptance by the Agent of a properly executed and
      delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 12.04(b).
      Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
      to the Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of
      all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning
      or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note (if any) evidencing such Loan,
      and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount
      shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender
      upon the request of any such Lender. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the
      Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities
