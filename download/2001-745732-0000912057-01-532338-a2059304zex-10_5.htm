provided in this Paragraph, if Ross exercises its option to extend the Term as provided in this Paragraph, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and the leasehold estate hereby granted

Ross and BNPPLC intend that (A)&nbsp;for the purposes of determining the proper accounting for this Lease under GAAP with respect to Ross, BNPPLC will be
treated as the owner and lessor of the Property and Ross will be treated as the lessee of the Property and (B)&nbsp;for income tax purposes and commercial law (including bankruptcy) and regulatory
purposes, (1)&nbsp;this Lease and the other Operative Documents shall be treated as a financing arrangement, (2)&nbsp;BNPPLC will be deemed a lender making loans to Ross in the aggregate principal

subparagraph&nbsp;be given

bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings affecting Ross or BNPPLC or any enforcement or collection actions arising out of such proceedings, the transactions evidenced by this Lease and the
other Operative Documents shall be characterized and treated as loans made to Ross by BNPPLC, as unrelated third party lender to Ross, secured by the Property. </FONT></P>

bankruptcy, regulatory, commercial or any other rules or concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents. Ross further acknowledges and agrees that it has, as it
deemed appropriate, obtained from and relied upon its own professional accountants, counsel and other advisors for such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents. </FONT></P>

payments to the contractor upon Ross's failure to make any required Issue 97-10 Prepayment hereunder, the obligation to make a progress payment would nonetheless be "incurred" by BNPPLC,

protection to the limit of not less than $15,000,000 combined single limit for bodily and personal injury, death and property damage in respect of any one occurrence. The CGL insurance must be primary
to, and shall receive no contribution from, any insurance policies or self-insurance programs otherwise afforded to or available to the Interested Parties, collectively or individually.
Further, the CGL insurance must include blanket contractual liability coverage which insures contractual liability under the indemnifications set forth in this Lease (though such coverage or the
amount thereof shall in no way limit such indemnifications). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
deductible or self-insured retention applicable to the CGL insurance shall not exceed $10,000 at any time when Ross shall continue to have the right
to exercise any Issue 97-10 Election, or shall have previously exercised an Issue 97-10 Election. After the expiration of Ross's right to exercise any Issue 97-10
Election, and provided no Issue 97-10 Election has been exercised by Ross, Ross may increase any deductible or self-insured retention applicable to such insurance, but not to
an amount in excess of $500,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;The

company or companies providing the insurance. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, BNPPLC may reasonably require (and unless and until Ross is otherwise notified by BNPPLC, BNPPLC does
require) that such insurance be provided under forms and by companies consistent with the following: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:
Lease Agreement dated as of May&nbsp;10, 2001 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Lease</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), between Ross Stores,&nbsp;Inc., as lessee,
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ross</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation, as lessor ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BNPPLC</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Gentlemen:
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Capitalized terms used in this letter are intended to have the meanings assigned to them in the Common Definitions and Provisions Agreement with is referenced
in the Lease. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>By this letter, which is given
pursuant to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>subparagraph </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>of the Lease, Ross requests that BNPPLC promptly establish a Fixed Rate (First Swap) for a notional amount of
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(which amount is the Estimated SLV described in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>subparagraph </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>of the Lease) for use in the calculation of the Effective Rate for
all
Base Rent Periods commencing on or after the following Fixed Rate Lock Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 200&nbsp;&nbsp;. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
contemplated in the conditions set forth in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>subparagraph </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>of the Lease, such Fixed Rate Lock Date is the first Business Day of a
calendar month which falls after the Projected Base Rent Commencement Date; such Fixed Rate Lock Date does not fall prior to the end of any Base Rent Period which has commenced or will commence before
BNPPLC receives this notice; and Ross expects BNPPLC to receive this notice more than ten days prior to such Fixed Rate Lock Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
an earlier phone conversation today between a representative of Ross and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the New York Branch of BNP Paribas, Ross requested an estimate from BNP Paribas of
the Fixed Rate (First Swap) that would be established by BNPPLC and BNP Paribas entering into an Interest Rate Swap. The estimate provided by telephone was:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percent
(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%) per annum. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>By
this letter, Ross confirms that it will accept such a rate or any lower rate as the Fixed Rate (First Swap) for purposes of the Lease. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>NOTE: </I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BNPPLC SHALL BE ENTITLED TO DISREGARD THIS NOTICE IF THE CONDITIONS TO A FIXED RATE LOCK, AS SPECIFIED IN  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>SUBPARAGRAPH</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B> OF THE
LEASE, HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED. HOWEVER, ROSS REQUESTS THAT BNPPLC NOTIFY ROSS IMMEDIATELY IF FOR ANY REASON BNPPLC BELIEVES THIS
NOTICE WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Common Definitions and Provisions Agreement, by and between BNP PARIBAS LEASING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BNPPLC</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and ROSS STORES,&nbsp;INC., a Delaware corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ross</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), is dated as of May&nbsp;10,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemporaneously with the execution of this Common Definitions and Provisions Agreement, Ross is executing the Closing Certificate (as defined below) in favor
of BNPPLC, and BNPPLC and Ross are executing the Lease (as defined below), the Construction Management Agreement (as defined below), and the Purchase Agreement (as defined below), all of which concern
the Property (as defined below). Each of the Closing Certificate, the Lease, the Construction Management Agreement and the Purchase Agreement (together with this Common Definitions and Provisions
Agreement, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Operative Documents</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") are intended to create separate and independent obligations upon the parties thereto. However, Ross and BNPPLC
intend that all of the Operative Documents share certain consistent definitions and other miscellaneous provisions. To that end, the parties are executing this Common Definitions and Provisions
Agreement and incorporating it by reference into each of the other Operative Documents. </FONT></P>

Indemnity Payments required because of or in connection with or arising out of Environmental Losses incurred or suffered by any Interested
Party; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Construction-Period
Indemnity Payments required because of or in connection with or arising out of Losses incurred or suffered by BNPPLC that BNPPLC would not have
incurred or suffered but for any act or any omission of Ross or of any Ross's contractors or subcontractors during the period that the Construction Management Agreement remains in force or during any
other period that Ross remains in possession or control of the Construction Project (excluding, however, as described below certain Losses consisting of claims related to any failure of Ross to

Construction Management Agreement because of a change in Ross's facility needs or in Ross's plans to meet its facility needs (such as, for example, a decision by Ross to lease or acquire another less

Management Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus,
for example, if a third party asserts a claim for damages against BNPPLC because of injuries the third party sustained while on the Land as a result of Ross's breach of its
obligation under the Construction Management Agreement to keep the Land and the Improvements thereon in a reasonably safe condition as Work progresses under Ross's direction and control, then any
Construction-Period Indemnity Payment required because of such third party claim will constitute an Absolute Construction Obligation under clause&nbsp;(2) of this definition. Similarly, if a claim
against BNPPLC by a third party injured on the Land during the progress of the Work is uninsured or under-insured only because of Ross's failure to obtain liability insurance in accordance with the
requirements of the Lease (the premiums for which insurance are reimbursable from Construction Advances as provided in the Construction Management Agreement), then Construction-Period Indemnity
Payments to BNPPLC for the uninsured or under-insured Losses arising out of the third party claim will constitute Absolute Construction Obligations under clause&nbsp;(2) of this definition. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is understood, however, that a failure of Ross to complete construction of the Construction Project will not necessarily constitute a breach of the Construction Management
Agreement, given that Ross may elect to terminate the Construction Management Agreement as provided in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>subparagraph&nbsp;4(D)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;thereof. In the
event the Construction Management Agreement is terminated by Ross pursuant to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>subparagraph&nbsp;4(D)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;thereof or by BNPPLC pursuant to </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>subparagraph&nbsp;4(E)</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;thereof, clause&nbsp;(2) of this definition will not be construed to include Construction-Period Indemnity Payments,
the sole reason for which are Losses suffered by BNPPLC consisting of claims related to Ross's failure to complete the Construction Project. </FONT></P>

(and is not obligated by the Lease to carry) insurance. "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Active Negligence</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall not include (1)&nbsp;any negligent failure of BNPPLC to act when the

the other Operative Documents, (2)&nbsp;any negligent failure of any other Interested Party to act when the duty to act would not have been imposed but for such party's contractual or other

BNPPLC shall be entitled (but not obligated) to extend the Base Rent Commencement Date one or more times and at any time before the Construction Project actually is complete and ready for occupancy.
To so extend the Base Rent Commencement Date, BNPPLC shall notify Ross thereof and of the date to which the Base Rent Commencement Date is extended, which may be the first Business Day of any calendar

to BNPPLC's Parent in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (London time) on the second Business Day preceding the first day of such period. BNPPLC shall instruct BNPPLC's

first day of such period, and (iii)&nbsp;for a time equal or comparable to the length of such period. If BNPPLC's Parent so chooses, it may determine LIBOR for any period by reference to the rate
reported by the British Banker's Association on Page&nbsp;3750 of the Telerate Service at approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (London time) on the second Business Day preceding the first day of such

such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The Floating Rate Payor (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably
practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on the effective date of or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Fixed Rate Lock Termination. The date

market value of the Property over Stipulated Loss Value or significantly increase any excess of Stipulated Loss Value over the market value of the Property, (b)&nbsp;change the general character of

any Third Party Contract between Ross and any of its Affiliates (an "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Affiliate's Contract</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") Ross shall reserve
the right to terminate the contract at any time, without cause, and without subjecting Ross to liability for any Termination Fee (as defined below). Further, Ross shall not enter into any Affiliate's
Contract that obligates Ross to pay more than would be required under an arms-length contract or that would require Ross to pay its Affiliate any amount in excess of the sum of actual,
out-of-pocket direct costs and internal labor costs incurred by the Affiliate to perform such contract. </FONT></P>

express right to terminate such contract at any time, without cause. Although any Third Party Contract (other than an Affiliate's contract) may require Ross to pay a specified Termination Fee in the
event of such a termination, the specified Termination Fee must not exceed the difference computed by subtracting (I)&nbsp;the aggregate of all Termination Fees that have been paid or would become
payable by Ross if Ross terminated all other Third Party Contracts, from (II)&nbsp;the Maximum Permitted Termination Fees. Without limiting the foregoing, Ross will manage and administer all Third

[as defined below] as of the date any such termination are not intended to be characterized as Termination Fees for purposes of this Agreement. If, as described in the
preceding paragraph, Ross reserves an absolute express right in a Third Party Contract to terminate such contract at any time, without cause, for a specified dollar amount, such dollar amount will
constitute a Termination Fee. If no such right is reserved in a Third Party Contract, the Termination Fee applicable to such contract for purposes of this Agreement will be the amount of damages that
Ross could be required to pay (in addition to payments required for Prior Work) upon an anticipatory repudiation of the Third Party Contract by Ross. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to future Scope Changes, the Construction Project will be substantially consistent with the following general description and with the Site Plan
attached to this Exhibit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
improvements will consist of the following, together with related parking and other improvements and the equipment listed from time to time on Construction Advance Request Forms delivered in
accordance with the terms of the Construction Management Agreement: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
improvements, to be known as the Ross Stores Southeast Retail Distribution Center, will be a 1.2M square foot facility capable of shipping an estimated 1.4M units daily to each of it's stores
located throughout the United States eventually including the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia. This facility will ultimately employ over 1100 associates responsible for processing merchandise, handling
transportation and conducting Ross Stores Distribution business. This state-of-the-art Southeast Distribution Center (SEDC) will be comprised of three main
components: the building, the material handling equipment (MHE) and the Warehouse Management System. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
1.2M square foot building will be made up of a merchandise processing area, a reserve inventory storage area, multiple associate break areas and 33,000 feet of office space including the
cafeteria. Merchandise will be received, ticketed and then shipped from this facility. An 800-trailer parking lot will be constructed to support the operations and unit-volume
requirements. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>Leading-edge
material handling equipment will be installed throughout the SEDC to allow associates to efficiently and effectively process merchandise through the DC. This MHE will include
conveyor equipment, multiple forklifts, radio-frequency equipment, a carton shoe-shipping sorter and tilt-tray sorters. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
new Warehouse Management System (WMS) will be implemented with the start-up of this facility also. The Warehouse management system is responsible for all of the computer systems that
control and account for all of the processing in the DC. This will be a new WMS modified and customized for the specific requirements of the Ross Stores business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:
Assignment of Construction Contract </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Ladies
and Gentlemen: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned hereby represents to BNP PARIBAS LEASING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BNPPLC</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and covenants with BNPPLC as
follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned has entered into that certain [Construction Contract] (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Construction
Contract</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") by and between the undersigned and Ross Stores,&nbsp;Inc. ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ross</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") dated ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the construction
of the improvements to be constructed as part of Ross's Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center leased by Ross (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Improvements</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") on the land
described in the Lease Documents described below (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Land</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and, together with the Improvements and any other improvements now on or constructed in the
future on the Land, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Project</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned has been advised that, by a Lease Agreement and a Construction Management Agreement, both dated as of May&nbsp;10, 2001 (collectively, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Lease Documents</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), BNPPLC is leasing the Project to Ross and has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease Documents, to provide a
construction allowance for the design and construction of the Improvements. The undersigned has also been advised that the Lease Documents expressly provide that third parties (including the
undersigned) are not intended as beneficiaries of the Lease Documents and, thus, will have no standing to enforce any obligations of Ross or BNPPLC under the Lease Documents, including any such
obligation that BNPPLC may have to provide the construction allowance. The undersigned understands that the Lease Documents expressly provide that Ross is not authorized to enter into any construction
contract or other agreement with any third party in the name of BNPPLC or to otherwise bind BNPPLC to any contract with a third party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
complete and correct copy of the Construction Contract is attached to this letter. The Construction Contract is in full force and effect and has not been modified
or amended, except as provided in any written modifications or amendments which are also attached to this letter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned has not sent or received any notice of default or any other notice for the purpose of terminating the Construction Contract, nor does the undesigned
have knowledge of any existing circumstance or event which, but for the elapse of time or otherwise, would constitute a default by the undersigned or by Ross under the Construction Contract. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned acknowledges and agrees that: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Title
to all Improvements shall, when constructed on the Land, pass directly to BNPPLC, not to Ross. BNPPLC shall not, however, be held liable for, and the

that in the event of such an assumption BNPPLC shall be liable for the unpaid balance of the contract sum due for the work of the undersigned, payable pursuant to (and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth for the benefit of the owner in) the Construction Contract, but in no event shall BNPPLC otherwise be personally liable for any acts or omissions on the part of Ross. </FONT></P>

defined in the Lease Documents), BNPPLC shall be entitled (but not obligated), by notice to the undersigned and without the necessity of the execution of any other document, to assume Ross's rights
and obligations under the Construction Contract, cure any defaults by Ross thereunder and enforce the Construction Contract and all rights of Ross thereunder. Within ten days of receiving notice from
BNPPLC that Ross's right to possession has been terminated, the undersigned shall send to BNPPLC a written estoppel letter stating: (i)&nbsp;that the undersigned has not performed any act or
executed any other instrument which invalidates or modifies the Construction Contract in whole or in part (or, if so, the nature of such modification); (ii)&nbsp;that the Construction Contract is
valid and subsisting and in full force and effect; (iii)&nbsp;that there are no defaults or events of default then existing under the Construction Contract and no event has occurred which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute such a default or event of default (or, if there is a default, the nature of such default in detail); (iv)&nbsp;that the
construction contemplated by the Construction Contract is proceeding in a satisfactory manner in all material respects (or if not, a detailed description of all significant problems with the progress
of construction); (v)&nbsp;a reasonably detailed report of the then critical dates projected by the undersigned for work and deliveries required to complete the Project; (vi)&nbsp;the total amount
received by the undersigned for construction through the date of the letter; (vii)&nbsp;the estimated total cost of completing the undersigned's work as of the date of the letter, together with a
current draw schedule; and (viii)&nbsp;any other information BNPPLC may request to allow it to decide whether to assume the Construction Contract. BNPPLC shall have seven days from receipt of such
written certificate containing all such requested information to decide whether to assume the Construction Contract. If BNPPLC fails to assume the Construction Contract within such time, the
undersigned agrees that BNPPLC shall not be liable (and the undersigned shall not assert or bring any action against BNPPLC, except to enforce statutory lien rights, if any, of the undersigned against
the Land or improvements on the Land) for any damages or other amounts resulting from the breach or termination of the Construction Contract or under any other theory of liability of any kind or
nature, but rather the undersigned shall look solely to Ross (and statutory lien rights, if any, of the undersigned against the Land and any improvements thereon) for the recovery of any such damages
or other amounts. </FONT></P>

BNPPLC notifies the undersigned that BNPPLC shall not assume the Construction Contract pursuant to the preceding paragraph&nbsp;following the termination of
Ross's right to possession of the Project under the Lease Documents, the undersigned shall immediately discontinue the work under the Construction Contract and remove its personnel from the Project,
and BNPPLC shall be entitled to take exclusive possession of the Project. The undersigned shall also, upon request by BNPPLC, deliver and assign to BNPPLC all plans and specifications and other
contract documents previously delivered to the undersigned (except that the undersigned may keep an original set of the Construction Contract and other contract documents executed by Ross), all other

the Lease Documents; provided, however, that if the work of the undersigned under the Construction Contract has been disrupted because of Ross's termination of the Construction Contract, the

otherwise). </FONT></P>

such other addresses as BNPPLC shall designate in notice sent to the undersigned), by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Following receipt of such notice, the undersigned will
permit BNPPLC or its designee to cure any such default within the time period reasonably required for such cure, but in no event less than thirty days. If it is necessary or helpful to take possession
of all or any portion of the Project to cure a default by Ross under the Construction Contract, the time permitted by the undersigned for cure by BNPPLC will include the time necessary to terminate
Ross's right to possession of the Project and evict Ross, provided that BNPPLC commences the steps required to exercise such right within sixty days after it is entitled to do so under the terms of
the Lease Documents and applicable law. If the undersigned incurs additional costs due to the extension of the aforementioned cure period, the undersigned shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment
to the price of the Construction Contract for such additional costs. </FONT></P>

Assignment of [Architect's Agreement/Engineering Contract] </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Ladies
and Gentlemen: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned hereby represents to BNP PARIBAS LEASING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BNPPLC</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and covenants with BNPPLC as
follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned has entered into that certain [Architect's Agreement/Engineering Contract] (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") by and between the undersigned and Ross Stores,&nbsp;Inc. ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ross</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") dated ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the [design/engineering] of the improvements to be constructed as part of Ross's Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center leased by Ross (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Improvements</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") on the land described in the Lease Documents described below (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Land</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and, together
with the Improvements and any other improvements now on or constructed in the future on the Land, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Project</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned has been advised that, by a Lease Agreement and a Construction Management Agreement, both dated as of May&nbsp;10, 2001 (collectively, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Lease Documents</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), BNPPLC is leasing the Project to Ross and has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease Documents, to
provide a construction allowance for the design and construction of the Improvements. The undersigned has also been advised that the Lease Documents expressly provide that third parties (including the
undersigned) are not intended as beneficiaries of the Lease Documents and, thus, will have no standing to enforce any obligations of Ross or BNPPLC under the Lease Documents, including any such
obligation that BNPPLC may have to provide the construction allowance. The undersigned understands that the Lease Documents expressly provide that Ross is not authorized to enter into any Agreement or
other agreement with any third party in the name of BNPPLC or to otherwise bind BNPPLC to any contract with a third party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
complete and correct copy of the Agreement is attached to this letter. The Agreement is in full force and effect and has not been modified or amended, except as
provided in any written modifications or amendments which are also attached to this letter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned has not sent or received any notice of default or any other notice for the purpose of terminating the Agreement, nor does the undesigned have
knowledge of any existing circumstance or event which, but for the elapse of time or otherwise, would constitute a default by the undersigned or by Ross under the Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
undersigned acknowledges and agrees that: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;BNPPLC
shall not be liable for, and the undersigned shall not assert, any claims, demands or liabilities against BNPPLC arising under or in any way relating to the
Agreement; provided, this paragraph&nbsp;will not (1)&nbsp;be construed as a waiver of any statutory mechanic's or materialmen's liens against the interests of Ross in and to the Land or the
improvements thereon that may otherwise exist or arise in favor of the undersigned, or (2)&nbsp;prohibit the undersigned from </FONT></P>

pursuant to (and subject to the terms and conditions set forth for the benefit of the owner in) the Agreement, but in no event shall BNPPLC otherwise be personally liable for any acts or omissions on

and obligations under the Agreement, cure any defaults by Ross thereunder and enforce the Agreement and all rights of Ross thereunder. Within ten days of receiving notice from BNPPLC that Ross's right
to possession has been terminated, the undersigned shall send to BNPPLC a written estoppel letter stating: (i)&nbsp;that the undersigned has not performed any act or executed any other instrument
which invalidates or modifies the Agreement in whole or in part (or, if so, the nature of such modification); (ii)&nbsp;that the Agreement is valid and subsisting and in full force and effect;
(iii)&nbsp;that there are no defaults or events of default then existing under the Agreement and no event has occurred which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
constitute such a default or event of default (or, if there is a default, the nature of such default in detail); (iv)&nbsp;that the services contemplated by the Agreement are proceeding in a
satisfactory manner in all material respects (or if not, a detailed description of all significant problems with the progress of services); (v)&nbsp;a reasonably detailed report of the then critical
dates projected by the undersigned for services required to complete the Project; (vi)&nbsp;the total amount received by the undersigned for services through the date of the letter; (vii)&nbsp;the
estimated total cost of completing such services as of the date of the letter, together with a current payment schedule; and (viii)&nbsp;any other information BNPPLC may request to allow it to
decide whether to assume the Agreement. BNPPLC shall have seven days from receipt of such written certificate containing all such requested information to decide whether to assume the Agreement. If
BNPPLC fails to assume the Agreement within such time, the undersigned agrees that BNPPLC shall not be liable (and the undersigned shall not assert or bring any action against BNPPLC or, except to
enforce statutory lien rights, if any, of the undersigned against the Land or improvements on the Land) for any damages or other amounts resulting from the breach or termination of the Agreement or
under any other theory of liability of any kind or nature, but rather the undersigned shall look solely to Ross (and statutory lien rights, if any, of the undersigned against the Land and any
improvements thereon) for the recovery of any such damages or other amounts. </FONT></P>

BNPPLC notifies the undersigned that BNPPLC shall not assume the Agreement pursuant to the preceding paragraph&nbsp;following the termination of Ross's right

this letter, or unconditionally and irrevocably committing to pay as described below, a Voluntary Ross Construction Contribution in the amount of $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
if the Voluntary Ross Construction Contribution required by this letter is not being delivered to BNPPLC by Ross contemporaneously with this letter, then at such time as
BNPPLC's obligation to fund additional Construction Advances is excused by any of the terms and conditions set forth in the Construction Management Agreement, Ross shall be obligated to deliver such
Voluntary Ross Construction Contribution as required to eliminate (or reduce to the maximum extent possible)
Projected Cost Overruns, including any Projected Cost Overruns caused by the accrual of Carrying Costs under and as described in the Lease referenced in the Construction Management Agreement. </FONT></P>

Murray, PLS # 17930, of Land Design Surveying,&nbsp;Inc. dated
3/23/01, which plat was delivered to BNPPLC at the request of Ross. All material improvements on the Land as of the date hereof are as shown on that survey, and except as shown on that survey there
are no easements or encroachments visible or apparent from an inspection of the Land. Adequate provision has been made (or can be made at a cost that is reasonable in connection with future
development of the Land) for the Land to be served by electric, gas, storm and sanitary sewers, sanitary water supply, telephone and other utilities required for the use thereof. All streets, alleys
and easements necessary to serve the Land and Improvements contemplated by the Lease and the Construction Management Agreement have been completed and are serviceable (or can be completed at a cost
that is reasonable in connection with future development of the Land). No extraordinary circumstances (including any use of the Land as a habitat for endangered species) exists that would materially
and adversely affect the future development of the Land, other than the need to mitigate the disturbance of wetlands on the Land as described below in this subparagraph. Further, Ross is not aware of
any latent or patent material defects or deficiencies in the Land that, either individually or in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect the use or occupancy of the Land or the
construction of Improvements as permitted by the Lease and Construction Management Agreement or could reasonably be anticipated to endanger life or limb. No part of the Land is within a flood plain as
designated by any governmental authority. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross represents and warrants to BNPPLC that the disturbance of wetlands on the Land required to accomodate the construction contemplated in the Construction Managment Agreement will
be lawful, subject to the conditions set forth in the Department of Army Permit issued to Seller (Permit No: 2001-1A-003) (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>404
Permit</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") or to such alternative conditions that may hereafter be established under permits or other written arrangments obtained or made by Ross and approved by the Army Corp
of Engineers (as the case may be, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>404 Permit Conditions</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Ross further represents and warrants that it has thoroughly investigated the cost of
satisfying the 404 Permit Conditions (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Wetland Mitigation Costs</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and that a reasonable estimate of the total Wetland Mitigation Costs is $113,200
(the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Projected Wetland Mitigation Costs</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Ross also agrees that if the actual Wetland Mitigation Costs should for any reason exceed an amount equal to
twice the Projected Wetland Mitigation Costs, BNPPLC shall be entitled to decline to pay for or reimburse the excess from Construction Advances, and any such excess that are not covered by
Construction Advances will constitute Environmental Losses which qualify Absolute Construction Obligations for purposes of the Lease. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross
will execute the 404 Permit as a transferee from Seller contemporaneously with the execution of this Certificate and Agreement. If requested by BNPPLC at any time thereafter,
Ross will execute a
transfer of the 404 Permit to BNPPLC or to any Affiliate of BNPPLC or other party that BNPPLC may designate, together with any other documents needed or helpful to effectuate such a transfer as
determined by BNPPLC. Ross shall also cooperate with BNPPLC in any other way that BNPPLC may request and that is necessary or helpful to effectuate such a trnasfer. </FONT></P>

commitments from Non-affiliate Banks under the Participation Agreement exceed $45,000,000, then BNPPLC will enter into a modification of the Operative Documents that increases the Maximum
Construction Allowance, if requested to do so by Ross. The amount of such increase will equal the amount by which the aggregate funding commitments from Non-affiliate Banks under the
