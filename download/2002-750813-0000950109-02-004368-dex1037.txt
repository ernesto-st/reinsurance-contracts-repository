     3.3  Failure of the Company to Deliver

     If on the Series A and B Closing Date or on the Series C Closing Date the
Company fails to tender to you the Notes to be acquired by you on such date or
if the conditions specified in Section 4 have not been fulfilled on either such

Agreement with respect to the Notes to be purchased by you on such date. Nothing
in this Section shall operate to relieve you from any of your obligations to the
Company under this Agreement or to waive any of the Company's rights against
you.

     5.3  Disclosure

     The Company, through its agent, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., has delivered to
you and each Other Purchaser a copy of a Confidential Private Placement
Memorandum, dated October 1995 (the "Memorandum"), relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all material respects,
the general nature of the business and principal properties of the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.3, this
Agreement, the Memorandum, the documents, certificates or other writings
delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and the financial statements listed in Schedule
5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. All
projections and forward-looking statements contained in the Memorandum are based
upon assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable and were made in
good faith, although no assurances can be given that the results set forth in
such projections or forward-looking statements will be achieved. Except as
disclosed in the Memorandum or as expressly described in Schedule 5.3, or in one
of the documents, certificates or other writings identified therein, or in the
financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 1994, there has
been no change in the financial condition, operations, business, properties or
prospects of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary except changes that
individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the Company that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set
forth herein or in the Memorandum or in the other documents, certificates and
other writings delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company specifically for
use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

     5.4  Organization and Ownership of Shares of Restricted Subsidiaries;
          Affiliates

          (a)  Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and
     correct lists of (i) the Restricted Subsidiaries, showing, as to each
     Restricted Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its
     organization and the percentage of shares of each class of its outstanding
     capital stock or similar equity interests owned by the Company and each
     other Restricted Subsidiary, and (ii) the Company's Affiliates (other than
     Restricted Subsidiaries).

<PAGE>

          (b)  All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
     interests of each Restricted Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being
     owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly
     issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or
     another Restricted Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien (except as
     otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).

          (c)  Each Restricted Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a
     corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
     good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is
     duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in
     good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required
     by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so
     qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate,
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such
     Restricted Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and authority to own
     or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease
     and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.

          (d)  No Restricted Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to
     any legal restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement, the
     agreements listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by
     corporate law statutes) restricting the ability of such Restricted
     Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar
     distributions of profits to the Company or any of the Restricted
     Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of capital stock or similar
     equity interests of such Restricted Subsidiary.

     5.5  Financial Statements

     The Company has delivered to each Purchaser copies of the financial
statements of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries listed on Schedule
5.5. All of said financial statements (including in each case the related
schedules and notes) present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates specified in such Schedule and the consolidated results of
their operations and cash flows for the respective periods so specified and have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the
periods involved except as set forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case
of any interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

     5.6  Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments, etc.

     Neither the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Notes, nor the execution, delivery and performance by any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Subsidiary Guaranty, will (a) contravene, result in
any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any
Lien in respect of any property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit
agreement, lease, corporate charter or by-laws, or any other agreement or
instrument to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound or by
which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective
properties may be bound or affected, (b) conflict with or result in a breach of
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or
ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or (c) violate any provision of any statute
or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary.

<PAGE>

     5.7  Governmental Authorizations, etc.

     No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or
declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance (a) by the Company of this Agreement or the
Notes or (b) by any Restricted Subsidiary of the Subsidiary Guaranty.

     5.8  Litigation; Observance of Agreements, Statutes and Orders

          (a)  Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits
     or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
     against or affecting the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any
     property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in any court or before
     any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority that,
     individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect.

          (b)  Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is in default
     under any term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by
     which it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court,
     arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable
     law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including without limitation
     Environmental Laws) of any Governmental Authority, which default or
     violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
     to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.9  Taxes

     The Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries have filed all tax returns that
are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes
shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and assessments
levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the
extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they
have become delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (a) the amount of
which is not individually or in the aggregate Material or (b) the amount,
applicability or validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance
with GAAP. The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges,
accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or other taxes for all fiscal periods
are adequate. The Federal income tax liabilities of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries have been determined by the Internal Revenue Service and
paid for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31,
1989.

<PAGE>

     5.10      Title to Property; Leases

     The Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title
to their respective properties that individually or in the aggregate are
Material, including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited
balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary after said date (except as sold or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and
clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that individually or in
the aggregate are Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and
effect in all material respects.

     5.11 Licenses, Permits, etc

     Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.11,

          (a) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries own or possess all
     licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights, service
     marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, with respect to the
     business of the Company and/or any Restricted Subsidiary as currently
     conducted, that individually or in the aggregate are Material, without
     known conflict with the rights of others;

          (b) to the best knowledge of the Company, no product of the Company or
     any Restricted Subsidiary infringes in any material respect upon any
     license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, service mark,
     trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person; and

          (c) to the best knowledge of the Company, there is no violation by any
     Person of any right of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary with
     respect to any patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or
     other right owned or used by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
     which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
     have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.12 Compliance with ERISA

          (a)  The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and
     administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for
     such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not
     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
     Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to
     Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code
     relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3 of ERISA), and
     no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could
     reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability by
     the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any
     of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
     in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or
     excise tax provisions or to Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other
     than such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the
     aggregate Material.

<PAGE>

          (b)  The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each
     of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of
     such Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial
     assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent
     actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of
     the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term
     "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in section 4001 of ERISA
     and the terms "current value" and "present value" have the meaning
     specified in section 3 of ERISA.

          (c)  The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred withdrawal
     liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liabilities)
     under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer Plans that
     individually or in the aggregate are Material.

          (d)  The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined as of
     the last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year in accordance
     with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without regard
     to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section
     4980B of the Code) of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not
     Material.

          (e)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and
     sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is
     subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with
     which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the
     Code. The representation by the Company in the first sentence of this
     Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of
     your representation in Section 6.3 as to the sources of the funds used to
     pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by you.

          (f)  Schedule 5.12 lists all ERISA Affiliates that are Restricted
     Subsidiaries and that maintain one or more Plans and any employee
     organizations in respect of any Multiemployer Plan or Plan. Schedule 5.12
     sets forth all ERISA Affiliates and all "employee benefit plans" with
     respect to which the Company or any "affiliate" of the Company is a
     "party-in-interest" or in respect of which the Notes could constitute an
     "employer security" ("employee benefit plan," "party-in-interest" and
     "employee organization" have the meanings specified in section 3 of ERISA,
     "affiliate" has the meaning specified in section 407(d) of ERISA and
     Section V of the Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction Exemption 95-60
     (60 FR 35925, July 12, 1995) and "employer security" has the meaning
     specified in section 407(d) of ERISA).

     5.13 Private Offering by the Company

     Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Notes
or any similar Securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the
same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any
Person other than you, the Other Purchasers and not more than fifty-four (54)
other Institutional Investors, each of which has been offered the Notes at a
private sale for investment. In reliance upon the accuracy of your
representations and warranties and the representations and warranties of the
Other Purchasers, neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken,
or will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to
the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

<PAGE>

     5.14 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations

     The Company will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes to repay
existing Debt and for general corporate purposes (including, without limitation,
the repayment of certain accounts payable, as more fully described on Schedule
5.3, if an acceptable agreement with the payee is concluded). No part of the
proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used, directly or
indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the
meaning of Regulation G of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any
Securities under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a violation of
Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a
violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not
constitute more than one percent (1%) of the value of the consolidated assets of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Company does not have any
present intention that margin stock will constitute more than five percent (5%)
of the value of such assets. As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock"
and "purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to them in
said Regulation G.

     5.15 Existing Debt; Future Liens

          (a) Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete
     and correct list of all outstanding Debt (in excess of $100,000
     outstanding) of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of December
     15, 1995, since which date there has been no material change in the
     amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities
     of the Debt of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries. Neither the
     Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is in default, and no waiver of
     default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal of or
     interest on any Debt of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary and no
     event or condition exists with respect to any Debt of the Company or any
     Restricted Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse
     of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Debt to
     become due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly
     scheduled dates of payment.

          (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither the Company nor any
     Restricted Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the
     future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its
     property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien
     not permitted by Section 10.4.

     5.16 Foreign Assets Control Regulations, etc.

     Neither the sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of the
proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any
of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury
Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling
legislation or executive order relating thereto.

<PAGE>

     5.17 Status under Certain Statutes

     Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is subject to regulation
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended, the Transportation Acts (49 U.S.C.), as
amended, or the Federal Power Act, as amended.

     5.18 Environmental Matters

     Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has knowledge of any
claim or has received any notice of any claim, and no proceeding has been
instituted raising any claim against the Company or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries or any of their respective real properties now or formerly owned,
leased or operated by any of them or other assets, alleging any damage to the
environment or violation of any Environmental Laws, except, in each case, such
as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as otherwise disclosed to you in writing,

          (a) neither the Company nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries has
     knowledge of any facts which would give rise to any claim, public or
     private, of violation of Environmental Laws or damage to the environment
     emanating from, occurring on or in any way related to real properties now
     or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or to other assets or
     their use, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be expected
     to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

          (b) neither the Company nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries has
     stored any Hazardous Materials on real properties now or formerly owned,
     leased or operated by any of them or has disposed of any Hazardous
     Materials in a manner contrary to any Environmental Laws in each case in
     any manner that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
     Adverse Effect; and

          (c) all buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or operated
     by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries are in compliance with
     applicable Environmental Laws, except where failure to comply could not
     reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     You represent that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account or for
one or more separate accounts maintained by you or for the account of one or

Section 4.4, counsel to the Company and your special counsel, will rely upon the
accuracy and truth of the foregoing representations and you hereby consent to
such reliance. You understand that the Notes have not been registered under the
Securities Act and may be resold only if registered pursuant to the provisions

     "THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
     AMENDED, AND MAY ONLY BE REOFFERED AND SOLD IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE
     REGISTRATION PROVISIONS OF SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM."

The legend requirements imposed by this Section 6.2 shall cease and terminate as
to any particular Note if the Notes represented thereby have been:

          (a)  effectively registered under the Securities Act (the Company
     having no obligation to effect the registration of such Notes) and disposed
     of in accordance with the registration statement covering such Notes,

          (b)  distributed to the public  pursuant to Rule 144 (or any successor
     provision) under the Securities Act, or

          (c)  otherwise transferred in accordance herewith and the subsequent
     disposition of such Notes shall not require the registration or
     qualification of such Notes under the Securities Act or any similar state
     law then in force.

Whenever such restrictions shall terminate as to any Notes, the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive from the Company, without expense to such holder
(except for stamp taxes or governmental charges, if any, payable in connection
with a transfer of such Notes, as required by Section 13.2), a new Note of like
tenor not bearing the legend set forth in this Section 6.2.

     6.3  ERISA.  You represent:

          (a) if you are acquiring the Notes for your own account with funds
     from or attributable to your general account, and in reliance upon the
     Company's representations set forth in Section 5.12 and the related
     disclosures set forth in Schedule 5.12, that the amount of the reserves and
     liabilities for the general account contracts (as defined by the annual
     statement for life insurance companies approved by the National Association
     of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC Annual Statement")) held by or on
     behalf of any Plan together with the amount of the reserves and liabilities
     for the general account contracts held by or on behalf of any other Plans
     maintained by the same employer (or affiliate thereof, as such term is
     defined in section V of DOL Prohibited Transaction Exemption 95-60 (60 FR
     35925, July 12, 1995)) or by the same employee organization (as defined in
     ERISA) in the general account do not exceed 10% of the total reserves and
     liabilities of the general account (exclusive of separate account
     liabilities) plus surplus as set forth in the NAIC Annual Statement filed
     with the state of domicile of the insurance company; for purposes of the
     percentage limitation in this clause (a), the amount of reserves and
     liabilities for the general account contracts held by or on behalf of a
     Plan shall be determined before reduction for credits on account of any
     reinsurance ceded on a coinsurance basis; or

<PAGE>

          (b) if any part of the funds being used by you to purchase the Notes
     shall come from assets of an employee benefit plan (as defined in section 3
     of ERISA) or a plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(1) of the Code), that:

               (i) if such funds are  attributable  to a "separate  account" (as
          defined in section 3 of ERISA), then

                    (A) all requirements for an exemption under DOL Prohibited
               Transaction Exemption 90-1 (issued January 29, 1990) are met with
               respect to the use of such funds to purchase the Notes, or

                    (B) the employee benefit plans with an interest in such
               separate account have been identified in a writing delivered by
               you to the Company;

               (ii) if such funds are attributable to a "separate account" (as
          defined in section 3 of ERISA) that is maintained solely in connection
          with fixed contracted obligations of an insurance company, any amounts
          payable, or credited, to any employee benefit plan having an interest
          in such account and to any participant or beneficiary of such plan
          (including an annuitant) are not affected in any manner by the
          investment performance of the separate account;

               (iii) if such funds are attributable to an "investment fund"
          managed by a "qualified plan asset manager" (as such terms are defined
          in Part V of DOL Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-14, issued March
          13, 1984), all requirements for an exemption under such Exemption are
          met with respect to the use of such funds to purchase the Notes; or

               (iv) such employee benefit plan is excluded from the provisions
          of section 406 of ERISA by virtue of section 4(b) of ERISA.

     6.4  Organization; Power and Authority; Compliance with Laws

     You represent and warrant that:

          (a) you are a corporation  duly organized,  validly  existing,  and in
     good standing under the laws of the state of your incorporation,

<PAGE>

          (b) you have the corporate  power and authority to execute and deliver

     will not violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation
     of any Governmental Authority applicable to you.

     6.5  Authorization, etc

     You represent and warrant that this Agreement has been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on your part, and this Agreement constitutes your
legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against you in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

shall be paid at such maturity. Each such prepayment or payment shall be at a
price of 100% of the principal amount prepaid or paid, together with interest

     8.2  Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount; Rescission

          (a) Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount. The Company may, at
     its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at any time all, or from
     time to time any part of, the Notes, in a principal amount of not less than
     (i) in the case of a partial prepayment other than a Contingent Optional
     Prepayment, Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), or (ii) in the case of a
     partial prepayment which is a Contingent Optional Prepayment, Two Million
     Dollars ($2,000,000), or, in either case, such lesser amount as shall then
     be outstanding, at one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount so
     prepaid, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the prepayment date with
     respect to such principal amount. The Company will give each holder written
     notice (an "Optional Prepayment Notice") of each optional prepayment under
     this Section 8.2 not less than thirty (30) days and not more than sixty
     (60) days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment (the "Optional
     Prepayment Date"). Each such Optional Prepayment Notice shall

               (i) specify the Optional Prepayment Date,

               (ii) state whether such prepayment is contingent upon the
          completion of an asset disposition by the Company or a Restricted
          Subsidiary or the consummation of a new credit facility with another
          creditor or group of creditors (a "Contingent Optional Prepayment")
          and describe in reasonable detail the terms thereof,

               (iii) specify the aggregate principal amount of each Series to be
          prepaid on such date,

               (iv)  specify the principal amount of each Note held by such
          holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.3),

               (v) specify the interest to be paid on the  prepayment  date with
          respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and

               (vi) be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial
          Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with
          such prepayment (calculated as if the date of such notice were the
          date of the prepayment), setting forth the details of such
          computation.

     Two (2) Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver
     to each holder a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the
     calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified prepayment date.

          (b)  Rescission. In the event that the Company shall give an Optional
     Prepayment Notice of any Contingent Optional Prepayment pursuant to Section
     8.2(a), the Company thereafter shall have the right to rescind such
     Optional Prepayment Notice by giving each holder written notice of such
     rescission (a "Rescission Notice") not less than ten (10) Business Days
     prior to the Optional Prepayment Date specified in such Optional Prepayment
     Notice. Upon delivery of such Rescission Notice in accordance with this
     Section 8.2(b), the Company shall be relieved of any obligation to make the
     Contingent Optional Prepayment on the Optional Prepayment Date in respect
     of which such Rescission Notice was delivered.

     8.3  Allocation of Partial Prepayments

     All partial prepayments of the Series A Notes, the Series B Notes and the
Series C Notes pursuant to Section 8.1 shall be allocated to all outstanding
Notes of the relevant Series ratably in accordance with the unpaid principal
amounts thereof. All partial prepayments of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2
shall be allocated to all outstanding Notes (without distinguishing among the
different Series) ratably in accordance with the unpaid principal amounts
thereof. Any partial prepayment of the Series A Notes, the Series B Notes and
the Series C Notes pursuant to Section 8.2 shall reduce the principal amount of
each required prepayment of such Series becoming due under Section 8.1 on and
after the date of such prepayment in the inverse order of the maturity thereof.

     8.4  Maturity; Surrender, etc.

     In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the
principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and
payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such
principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if
any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such
principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall
cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the
Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in
lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

     8.5  Purchase of Notes

     The Company will not and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or
Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or
indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the payment or prepayment
of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes. The
Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Restricted
Subsidiary or Affiliate pursuant to any payment or prepayment of Notes pursuant
to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued in substitution or
exchange for any such Notes.

     8.6  Make-Whole Amount

     The term "Make-Whole Amount" means, with respect to any Series A Note,
Series B Note or Series C Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called
Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that
the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of
determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following
meanings:

          "Called Principal" means, with respect to any Series A Note, Series B
     Note, or Series C Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid
     pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due
     and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

<PAGE>

          "Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
     Series A Note, Series B Note, or Series C Note, the amount obtained by
     discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called
     Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date
     with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted
     financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic
     basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the
     Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.

          "Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called Principal of
     any Series A Note, Series B Note, or Series C Note, the sum of one half
     percent (.5%) per annum plus the yield to maturity implied by (i) the
     yields reported, as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second (2nd)
     Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
     Principal, on the display designated as "Page 678" on the Telerate Access
     Service (or such other display as may replace Page 678 on the Telerate
     Access Service) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a
     maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of
     such Settlement Date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported as of such
     time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable, the
     Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for
     which such yields have been so reported as of the second (2nd) Business Day
     preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in
     Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor
     publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a constant
     maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of
     such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be determined, if necessary,
     by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields
     in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating
     linearly between (1) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the
     duration closest to and greater than the Remaining Average Life and (2) the
     actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the duration closest to and
     less than the Remaining Average Life.

          "Remaining Average Life" means, with respect to any Called Principal,
     the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained
     by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products
     obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining
     Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number
     of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse
     between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the
     scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.

          "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to the Called
     Principal of any Series A Note, Series B Note, or Series C Note, all
     payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due
     after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no
     payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date,
     provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest
     payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes of such Series,
     then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be
     reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and
     required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or
     12.1.

<PAGE>

          "Settlement Date" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
     Series A Note, Series B Note, or Series C Note, the date on which such
     Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or
     is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as
     the context requires.

9.   AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

     The Company covenants that so long as any of the Notes are outstanding:

     9.1  Compliance with Law

     The Company will and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to comply with all
laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations to which each of them is
subject, including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, and will obtain and
maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other
governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective
properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses, in each case to the
extent necessary to ensure that non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or
governmental rules or regulations or failures to obtain or maintain in effect
such licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental
authorizations could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     9.2  Insurance

     The Company will and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to maintain, with
financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their
respective properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies,
of such types, on such terms and in such amounts (including deductibles,
co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate reserves are maintained with
respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established
reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated,
except to the extent that the failure to maintain such insurance could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     9.3  Maintenance of Properties

     The Company will and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to maintain and
keep, or cause to be maintained and kept, their respective properties in good
repair, working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that
the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all
times, provided that

          (a) no violation of this Section 9.3 shall be deemed to have occurred
     with respect to any property of the Company or any Subsidiary damaged or
     destroyed by a casualty occurrence, so long as the Company or such
     Restricted Subsidiary is proceeding diligently to repair or replace such
     property, and

          (b) this Section shall not prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from
     discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if
     such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business and the
     Company has concluded that such discontinuance could not, individually or
     in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
     (which term shall not, for the purpose of this clause (b) only, include the
     discontinuance of the operation and maintenance of a Restricted
     Subsidiary's properties that would render such Restricted Subsidiary unable
     to perform its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty, and therefore
     result in a Material Adverse Effect only under clause (c) of the definition
     of such term).

<PAGE>

     9.4  Payment of Taxes and Claims

     The Company will and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to file all tax
returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all
taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes,
assessments, governmental charges, or levies imposed on them or any of their
properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and
assessments have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent
and all claims for which sums have become due and payable that have or might
become a Lien on properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, provided
that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment
or claims if (a) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by
the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in
appropriate proceedings, and the Company or such Subsidiary has established
adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company
or such Subsidiary or (b) the nonpayment of all such taxes and assessments in
the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     9.5  Corporate Existence, etc.

     The Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect
its corporate existence. Subject to Sections 10.5 and 10.6, the Company will at
all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of
each of the Subsidiaries (unless merged into the Company or a Subsidiary) and
all rights and franchises of the Company and the Subsidiaries unless, in the
good faith judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure to preserve
and keep in full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise
could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect (which term shall not (for the purpose of this Section
9.5 only) include, with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary, the termination of
or failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect such corporate
existence, right or franchise that would render such Restricted Subsidiary
unable to perform its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty, and therefore
result in a Material Adverse Effect only under clause (c) of the definition of
such term).

     9.6  Pari Passu

     The Company covenants that its obligations under the Notes and under this
Agreement and the Other Agreements do and will rank at least pari passu with all
its other present and future unsecured Senior Debt.

<PAGE>

     9.7  Subsidiary Guaranty

     The Company will cause each Subsidiary which becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary after the Series A and B Closing Date to execute and deliver to the
holders a copy of the Joinder Agreement in the form attached to the Subsidiary
Guaranty as Annex 2, duly executed by such Subsidiary, together with an opinion
of counsel satisfactory to the Required Holders addressing with respect to such
Subsidiary the issues relating to Subsidiaries and the Subsidiary Guaranty in
the form of opinion attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4(a).

     9.8  Application of Proceeds; Releases

     The Company will

          (a) not later than December 29, 1995,

               (i) cause all Debt outstanding under the Revolving Facility and
          the DDD Facility to be paid in full with the proceeds of the sale of
          the Series A Notes and Series B Notes, and

               (ii) deliver to the holders of the Notes

                    (A) with respect to the Revolving Facility, copies of (I) a
               written statement, executed by the Revolving Facility Lenders,
               terminating the Revolving Facility, and (II) such UCC-3
               termination statements, executed by the Revolving Facility
               Lenders, and such other releases executed by the Revolving
               Facility Lenders, as shall be deemed necessary or appropriate by
               the Company to terminate the Revolving Facility Lenders' security
               interest in any and all properties of the Company and the
               Restricted Subsidiaries, and

                    (B) with respect to the DDD Facility, copies of (I) a
               written statement, executed by the DDD Facility Lenders,
               terminating the DDD Facility, and (II) a written statement,
               executed by the DDD Facility Lenders, providing further
               assurances to execute and deliver such acknowledgements, mortgage
               releases and other releases as shall be necessary to permit the
               Company to comply with the provisions of clause (b) of this
               Section 9.8,

          (b) not later than January 5, 1996, deliver to the holders of the
     Notes an acknowledgement by the Company of receipt of all stock of the
     Restricted Subsidiaries pledged as security to the Revolving Facility
     Lenders and the DDD Facility Lenders, and

          (c) not later than January 15, 1996, with respect to the DDD Facility,
     deliver to the holders of the Notes copies of such mortgage releases and
     such other releases executed by the DDD Facility Lenders as shall be deemed
     necessary or appropriate by the Company to terminate the DDD Facility
     Lenders' security interest in any and all properties of DDD.

     10.3 Debt Incurrence

          (a) Company Debt. The Company will not, directly or indirectly,
     create, incur, assume, guarantee, or otherwise become directly or
     indirectly liable with respect to, any Debt (including, without limitation,
     any extension, renewal or refunding of Debt), unless on the date the

     deemed, at the time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, to have incurred

     refunding any Debt shall be deemed to have incurred such Debt at the time
     of such extension, renewal or refunding.

     10.4 Liens

     The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or permit to exist
(upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any Lien on or with respect

               (ii) the amount of Debt secured by any such Lien shall not exceed
          an amount equal to the lesser of the total purchase or construction
          price or Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Board
          of Directors or the board of directors of such Restricted Subsidiary)
          of the property being acquired or constructed, determined at the time

          any such transaction;

     Section 10.10 (including, without limitation, licenses, participation
     rights, rebate or revenue sharing obligations, or similar encumbrances),
     provided that such Liens have not arisen in connection with the incurrence
     of Debt; and

<PAGE>

          (j) Liens, not otherwise permitted by the provisions of this Section
     10.4, on property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided
     that on the date the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary becomes liable
     with respect to the Debt secured by such Liens, and immediately after
     giving effect thereto and the concurrent retirement of any other Debt
     constituting Priority Debt,

               (i) no Default or Event of Default exists, and

               (ii) the aggregate amount of Priority Debt does not exceed ten
          percent (10%) of Consolidated Tangible Assets.

     In case any property shall be subjected to a Lien in violation of this
Section 10.4, the Company will forthwith make or cause to be made, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, provision whereby the Notes will be
secured equally and ratably as to such property with all other obligations
secured thereby pursuant to such agreements and instruments as shall be approved
by the Required Holders, and the Company will promptly cause to be delivered to
each holder of a Note an opinion, reasonably satisfactory to the Required
Holders, of Gardere Wynne Sewell & Riggs, L.L.P. or other independent counsel
satisfactory to the Required Holders to the effect that such agreements and
instruments are enforceable in accordance with their terms, and in any event the
Notes shall have the benefit, to the full extent that, and with such priority
as, the holders of Notes may be entitled under applicable law, of an equitable
Lien on such property (and any proceeds thereof) securing the Notes. Such
violation of this Section 10.4 will constitute an Event of Default hereunder,
whether or not any such provision is made or any equitable Lien is created
pursuant to this Section 10.4.

     10.5 Mergers and Consolidations

     The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consolidate with or merge with any other corporation or convey,
transfer, spin-off or lease substantially all of its assets in a single
transaction or series of transactions to any Person (except that a Restricted
Subsidiary may (x) consolidate with or merge with, or convey, transfer, spin-off
or lease substantially all of its assets in a single transaction or series of
transactions to, another Restricted Subsidiary or the Company and (y) convey,
transfer, spin-off or lease all of its assets in compliance with the provisions
of Section 10.6), provided that the foregoing restriction does not apply to the
consolidation or merger of the Company with, or the conveyance, transfer,
spin-off or lease of substantially all of the assets of the Company in a single
transaction or series of transactions to, any Person so long as:

          (a) the successor formed by such consolidation or the survivor of such
     merger or the Person that acquires by conveyance, transfer, spin-off or
     lease substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety, as the
     case may be (the "Successor Corporation"), shall be a solvent corporation
     organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any
     state thereof or the District of Columbia and shall conduct substantially
     all of its business in one or more of such jurisdictions;

          (b) if the Company is not the Successor Corporation, such corporation
     shall have executed and delivered to each holder its assumption of the due
     and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition of
     this Agreement and the Notes (pursuant to such agreements and instruments
     as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders), and the
     Company shall have caused to be delivered to each holder an opinion,
     reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, of Gardere Wynne Sewell &
     Riggs, L.L.P. or other nationally recognized independent counsel
     satisfactory to the Required Holders, to the effect that all agreements or
     instruments effecting such assumption are enforceable in accordance with
     their terms and comply with the terms hereof;

<PAGE>

          (c) immediately prior to, and immediately after giving effect to, such
     transaction, no Default or Event of Default would exist; and

          (d) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, the Successor
     Corporation would be permitted, pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.3,
     to incur at least One Dollar ($1) of additional Debt owing to a Person
     other than a Restricted Subsidiary of the Successor Corporation.

No such conveyance, transfer, spin-off or lease of substantially all of the
assets of the Company shall have the effect of releasing the Company or any
Successor Corporation from its liability under this Agreement or the Notes.

     10.6 Sale of Assets

          (a) Sale of Assets. The Company will not, and will not permit any of
     the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Transfer, provided that the
     foregoing restriction does not apply to a Transfer if:

               (i) the property that is the subject of such Transfer constitutes
          either (A) inventory held for sale, or (B) equipment, fixtures,
          supplies or materials no longer required in the operation of the
          business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or that is
          obsolete, and, in the case of any Transfer described in clause (A) or
          clause (B), such Transfer is in the ordinary course of business (an
          "Ordinary Course Transfer");

               (ii) either

                    (A) such Transfer is from a Restricted Subsidiary to the
               Company or a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary, or

<PAGE>

                    (B) such Transfer is from the Company to a Wholly-Owned
               Restricted Subsidiary,

          so long as immediately before and immediately after the consummation
          of such transaction, and after giving effect thereto, no Default or
          Event of Default exists or would exist (each such Transfer, an
          "Intergroup Transfer," and, collectively with any Ordinary Course
          Transfers, "Excluded Transfers"); or

               (iii) such Transfer is not an Excluded Transfer and all of the
          following conditions shall have been satisfied with respect thereto:

                    (A) such Transfer does not involve a Substantial Portion of
               the property of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries,

                    (B) in the good faith opinion of the Company, the Transfer
               is in exchange for consideration with a Fair Market Value at
               least equal to that of the property exchanged, and is in the best
               interests of the Company, and

                    (C) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no
               Default or Event of Default would exist.

          (b) Debt Prepayment Transfers and Reinvested Transfers.

               (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.6(a), the
          determination of whether a Transfer involves a Substantial Portion of
          the property of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as
          provided in Section 10.6(a)(iii)(A), shall be made without taking into
          account the same proportion of the book value attributable to the
          property subject to such Transfer as shall be equal to the proportion
          of the Net Asset Sale Proceeds Amount (the "Designated Portion") to be
          applied to either a prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2 (a
          "Prepayment Transfer") or the acquisition of assets similar to the
          assets which were the subject of such Transfer (a "Reinvested
          Transfer") within one hundred eighty (180) days of the consummation of
          such Transfer, as specified in an Officer's Certificate delivered to
          each holder prior to, or contemporaneously with, the consummation of
          such Transfer.

               (ii) If, notwithstanding the certificate referred to in the
          foregoing clause (i), the Company shall fail to apply the entire
          amount of the Designated Portion as specified in such certificate
          within the period stated in Section 10.6(b)(i), the computation of
          whether such Transfer involved a Substantial Portion of the property
          of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be recomputed, as
          of the date of such Transfer, by taking into account the same
          proportion of the book value attributable to the property subject to
          such Transfer as shall be equal to the proportion of the Net Asset
          Sale Proceeds Amount actually applied to either a Prepayment Transfer
          or a Reinvested Transfer within such period. If, upon the
          recomputation provided for in the preceding sentence, such Transfer
          involved a Substantial Portion of the property of the Company and the
          Restricted Subsidiaries, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have
          existed as of the expiration of such period.

          (c)  Certain  Definitions.  The  following  terms  have the  following
     meanings:

               (i) Disposition  Value -- means, at any time, with respect to any
          Transfer of property,

                    (A) in the case of property that does not constitute capital
               stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, the book value thereof, valued
               at the amount taken into account (or which would be taken into
               account) in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company then
               most recently required to have been delivered to the holders
               pursuant to Section 7.1, and

<PAGE>

                    (B) in the case of property that constitutes capital stock
               of a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal to that percentage of
               the book value of the assets of the Restricted Subsidiary that
               issued such capital stock as is equal to the percentage that the
               book value of such capital stock represents of the book value of
               all of the outstanding capital stock of such Restricted
               Subsidiary (assuming, in making such calculations, that all
               Securities convertible into such capital stock are so converted
               and giving full effect to all transactions that would occur or be
               required in connection with such conversion), determined as of
               the date of the balance sheet referred to in the foregoing clause
               (A).

               (ii)  Substantial  Portion -- means,  at any time,  any  property
          subject to a Transfer if

                    (A) the Disposition Value of such property, when added to
               the Disposition Value of all other property of the Company and
               the Restricted Subsidiaries that has been the subject of a
               Transfer (other than an Excluded Transfer and subject, with
               respect to both such property and all such other property, to the
               provisions of Section 10.6(b)) during the then current fiscal
               year of the Company, exceeds an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
               of Consolidated Total Assets as reflected (or as would be
               reflected) in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company then
               most recently required to have been delivered to the holders
               pursuant to Section 7.1, or

                    (B) the Disposition Value of such property, when added to
               the Disposition Value of all other property of the Company and
               the Restricted Subsidiaries that has been the subject of a
               Transfer (other than an Excluded Transfer and subject, with
               respect to both such property and all such other property, to the
               provisions of Section 10.6(b)) during the period beginning on the
               Series A and B Closing Date and ending on and including the date
               of the consummation of such Transfer, exceeds an amount equal to
               twenty percent (20%) of Consolidated Total Assets as reflected
               (or as would be reflected) in the consolidated balance sheet of
               the Company then most recently required to have been delivered to
               the holders pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof.

               (iii) Transfer -- means, with respect to any Person, any
          transaction in which such Person sells, conveys, transfers or leases
          (as lessor) any of its property, including, without limitation,
          capital stock of any other Person.

     10.7 Restricted Payments and Restricted Investments

          (a) Limitation. The Company will not, and will not permit any of the
     Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, declare, make or incur
     any liability to make any Restricted Payment or make or authorize any
     Restricted Investment unless immediately after giving effect to such
     action:

               (i) the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of outstanding Restricted
          Investments (valued immediately after such action), plus (y) the
          aggregate amount of Restricted Payments of the Company and the
          Restricted Subsidiaries declared or made during the period commencing
          on the Series A and B Closing Date, and ending on the date such
          Restricted Payment or Restricted Investment is declared or made,
          inclusive, would not exceed the sum of

                    (A) Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), plus

                    (B) fifty percent (50%) of Consolidated Net Income for the
               period commencing July 1, 1995 and ending on the date such
               Restricted Payment or such Restricted Investment is declared or
               made (or minus 100% of Consolidated Net Income for such period if
               Consolidated Net Income for such period is a loss), plus

                    (C) the aggregate  amount of Net Proceeds of Common Stock of
               the Company for such period; and

               (ii) the Company could incur, pursuant to Section 10.3, at least
          One Dollar ($1) of additional Debt owing to a Person other than a
          Restricted Subsidiary; and

               (iii) no Default or Event of Default would exist.

          (c) Investments of Subsidiaries. Each Person which becomes a
     Restricted Subsidiary after the Series A and B Closing Date will be deemed
     to have made, on the date such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, all
     Restricted Investments of such Person in existence on such date.
     Investments in any Person that ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary after
     the Series A and B Closing Date (but in which the Company or another
     Restricted Subsidiary continues to maintain an Investment) will be deemed
     to have been made on the date on which such Person ceases to be a
     Restricted Subsidiary.

<PAGE>

     10.8 Limitations on Certain Restricted Subsidiary Actions

     The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement which would restrict any Restricted
Subsidiary's legal ability or right to:

          (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its common stock;

          (b) pay any Debt owing to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary
     (other than waivers of subrogation);

          (c)  make  any  Investment  in  the  Company  or  another   Restricted
     Subsidiary;

          (d) transfer its property to the Company or another Restricted
     Subsidiary (except that any such agreement may (i) prohibit the assignment
     of contractual rights, (ii) include grants of contractual rights of first
     refusal, and (iii) include similar contractual obligations not unusual in
     the course of such Restricted Subsidiary's business); or

          Date and set forth in Schedule 10.8,

               (B) this Agreement, or

               (C) other agreements relating to the creation of Senior Debt
          incurred in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and

          (ii) the restrictions of clause (d) of this Section 10.8 shall not
     apply to any agreement relating to the creation of Priority Debt or Debt of
     Restricted Subsidiaries secured by Liens permitted by Section 10.4(a) to
     Section 10.4(i), inclusive, to the extent that such restrictions limit the
     ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to transfer the Property that secures
     such Priority Debt or such other Debt;

provided further that, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such
agreement does not impose any limitations on any Restricted Subsidiary's ability
to perform its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty.

<PAGE>

     10.9 Affiliate Transactions

     The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, enter into any transaction (other than transactions among the
Company and its wholly-owned Unrestricted Subsidiaries that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, Material), including, without limitation, the
purchase, sale or exchange of property or the rendering of any service, with any
Affiliate, except in the ordinary course of business of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than it would obtain in a comparable
arm's-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

     10.10 Line of Business

     The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Subsidiaries to,
engage in any business if, as a result, the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken

services, (b) exploration for, and development and ownership of, gas and oil
reserves, (c) gas marketing and (d) businesses related to the foregoing

     paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default
     described in clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described in clause (vi) of

thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal
amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be
immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder has the right to
maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except
as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a
Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are
accelerated as a result of an Event of Default is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

<PAGE>

     12.2 Other Remedies

     If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately
due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time
outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an
action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the
specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an
injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid
of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.

     12.3  Rescission

     At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to
clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the Required Holders, by written notice to
the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if
(a) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid
other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue
principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default
Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts
that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or
have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c) no judgment or decree has been
entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No
rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any
subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

     12.4  No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, etc.

     No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder in exercising
any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise
prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy
conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be
exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or
now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Without
limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15, the Company will pay
to each holder on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all
costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection
under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees, expenses and disbursements.

13.  REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES

     13.1  Registration of Notes

     The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the
registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of
each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address
of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name
any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder
thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any
notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any holder that
is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a complete and
correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders.

<PAGE>

     13.2  Transfer and Exchange of Notes

     Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company
for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for
registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument
of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or his attorney
duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each
transferee of such Note or part thereof, and subject to compliance with all
restrictions on transfer set forth herein and in such Note), the Company shall
execute and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as provided below),
promptly and, in any event, within ten (10) days of the surrender of such Note
by the registered holder thereof, one or more new Notes (as requested by the
holder thereof) in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to
the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be
payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be substantially in
the form of Exhibit 1A, Exhibit 1B or Exhibit 1C, as the case may be. Each such
new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall
have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note
if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of
a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in
respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in
denominations of less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), provided
that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its
entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note
registered in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have
made the representations set forth in Section 6.1 (unless such transfer is
effected pursuant to a transaction in which the representation set forth in such
Section is not required in order to comply with the securities laws applicable
to such transfer) and Section 6.3.

     13.3  Replacement of Notes

     Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of
the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note
(which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from
such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction
or mutilation), and

          (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably
     satisfactory to it (provided that if a Qualified Institutional Buyer is the
     holder of such Note, the unsecured agreement of indemnity of such holder
     shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or

          (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
     thereof,

the Company at its own expense shall execute and, within ten (10) days after
such receipt, deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest
from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.

<PAGE>

14.  PAYMENTS ON NOTES

     14.1  Place of Payment

     The Company will punctually pay, or cause to be paid, the principal of and
interest (and Make-Whole Amount, if any) on the Notes, as and when the same
shall become due and payable according to the terms hereof and of the Notes.
Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and
interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made at the principal
office of the Company. The Company may at any time, by notice to each holder,
change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall
be either the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the
principal office of a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction.

     14.2 Home Office Payment

     So long as you or your nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and
notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the
contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal,
Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at the address
specified for such purpose below your name in Schedule A, or by such other
method or at such other address as you shall have from time to time specified to
the Company in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender
of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written
request of the Company made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after
payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall surrender such Note for
cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at its
principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated
by the Company pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition
of any Note held by you or your nominee you will, at your election, either
endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which
interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange
for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will afford the
benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct
or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by you under this Agreement.

15.  EXPENSES, ETC

     15.1 Transaction Expenses

you and each Other Purchaser or holder in connection with the consideration,
evaluation, analysis, assessment, negotiation, preparation and/or execution of
any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of this Agreement or the

expenses, including financial advisors' fees, incurred in connection with the
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or any Subsidiary or in connection with
any work-out or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Notes. The Company will pay, and will save you and each other holder harmless
from, all claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of brokers
and finders (other than those retained by you).

     15.2 Survival

     The obligations of the Company under this Section 15 will survive the
payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.

16.   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT

     All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer
by you of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any
Note (but not the payment in full of all of the Notes), and may be relied upon
by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any
time by or on behalf of you or any other holder. All statements contained in any
certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the
Company under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
and the Notes embody the entire agreement and understanding between you and the
Company and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the
subject matter hereof.

17.  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     17.1 Requirements

     This Agreement and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any term
hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively),
with (and only with) the written consent of the Company and the Required
Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of
Section 1 to Section 6, inclusive, or Section 21, or any defined term as it is
used therein, will be effective as to you unless consented to by you in writing,
and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the
holder of each Note at the time outstanding affected thereby, (i) subject to the
provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change the
amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate
or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or of the
Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage of the principal
amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to any such
amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or
20.

<PAGE>

     17.2 Solicitation of Holders

          (a) Solicitation. The Company will provide each holder (irrespective
     of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information,
     sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable
     such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any
     proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions
     hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and
     correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to
     the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder promptly following the
     date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or
     approval of, the requisite holders.

          (b) Payment. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or cause
     to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional
     interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder as
     consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of
     any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless
     such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently
     granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder then outstanding even if
     such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.

          (c) Scope of Consent. Any consent made pursuant to this Section 17.2
     by a holder of Notes that has transferred or has agreed to transfer its
     Notes to the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate and has provided or
     has agreed to provide such written consent as a condition to such transfer
     shall be void and of no force and effect except solely as to such holder,
     and any amendments effected or waivers granted or to be effected or granted
     that would not have been or would not be so effected or granted but for
     such consent (and the consents of all other holders of Notes that were
     acquired under the same or similar conditions) shall be void and of no
     force and effect, retroactive to the date such amendment or waiver
     initially took or takes effect, except solely as to such holder.

     17.3 Binding Effect, etc.

     Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies
equally to all holders and is binding upon them and upon each future holder of
any Notes and upon the Company without regard to whether such Note has been
marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will
extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of
Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon.
No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any
delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a
waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term "this
Agreement" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time
to time be amended or supplemented.

<PAGE>

     17.4 Notes held by Company, etc.

     Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite
percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding have
approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this
Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided
herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a
specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company, any Wholly-Owned
Restricted Subsidiary or any of the Company's Affiliates shall be deemed not to
be outstanding.

of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), or

limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) documents received by you at the Closings (except the Notes
themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates and other information
previously or hereafter furnished to you, may be reproduced by you by any

existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by you in the regular
course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of
such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19
shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder from contesting any such
reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from
introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

information delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly marked or labeled

purposes of evaluating and administering your investment in the Notes, provided
that you may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to

     to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in
     accordance with the terms of this Section 20,

     has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information
     to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20),

          (v) any Institutional Investor from which you offer to purchase any
     Security of the Company (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its
     receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of
     this Section 20),

          (vi) any federal or state  regulatory  authority  having  jurisdiction
     over you,

          (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any
     similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that
     requires access to information about your investment portfolio, or

     necessary or appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, rule,
     regulation or order applicable to you, (x) in response to any subpoena or
     other legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which you are

<PAGE>

     a party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to
     the extent you may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be
     necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the
     rights and remedies under your Notes and this Agreement.

Each holder, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were
a party to this Agreement.

21.  SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER

     You shall have the right to substitute any one of your Affiliates as the
purchaser of the Notes that you have agreed to purchase hereunder, by written
notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by both you and such
Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this
Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy
with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt
of such notice, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in
this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu
of you. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser
hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to you all of the Notes then
held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer,
wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section
21), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall
refer to you, and you shall have all the rights of an original holder under this
Agreement.

22.  MISCELLANEOUS


     22.1 Successors and Assigns

     All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on

subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.

     22.2 Payments Due on Non-Business Days

     If any payment due on, or with respect to, any Note shall fall due on a day
other than a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the first (1st)
Business Day following the day on which such payment shall have so fallen due,
provided that if all or any portion of such payment shall consist of a payment
of interest, for purposes of calculating such interest, such payment shall be
deemed to have been originally due on such first (1st) following Business Day,
such interest shall accrue and be payable to (but not including) the actual date
of payment and the amount of the next succeeding interest payment shall be
adjusted accordingly.

     22.3 Severability

     Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining

jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

<PAGE>

such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable
whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.

          interest in and to the Trust or the res thereof (other than a
          reversionary interest in any United States Governmental Securities, or
          the proceeds thereof, remaining after the full, final and indefeasible
          payment of the principal amount of the Notes and all interest and

          of the events described in clause (g) or clause (h) of Section 11 were
          to occur, the Trust and the res thereof would not be part of the

          depositing of the United States Governmental Securities therein shall
          not, for purposes of the Code with respect to any holder, result in a

          (II) such holder shall have been deemed to have suffered a loss with
          respect to such transaction,

               (vii) all principal, interest costs, expenses and other sums due

               (viii) either (A) the Company shall have delivered to the holders
          an opinion of independent certified public accountants of recognized
          national standing selected by the Company, reasonably satisfactory to
          the Required Holders, or (B) at the option of the Company at its
          expense (provided that the Company shall have the right to negotiate
          with such accountants regarding the cost of furnishing such opinion),
          the holders shall have received an opinion of independent certified
          public accountants of recognized national standing, reasonably
          satisfactory to the Required Holders, stating that under GAAP the
          creation of the Trust and the depositing of the United States
          Governmental Securities therein shall not result, with respect to any
          holder, in an exchange of the Note or Notes of such holder for all or
          part of such United States Governmental Securities which exchange
          would result in a gain or loss being realized by such holder under
          GAAP in respect of such transaction, then, and in that case, all
          obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Other Agreements
          and the Notes shall be discharged; provided, however, if the
          contribution to the Trust of any United States Governmental Securities
          is invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside,
          or if any such United States Governmental Securities are required to
          be returned or redelivered to the Company, or any custodian, trustee,
          receiver or any other Person under any bankruptcy act, state or
          federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of
          such invalidation, return or redelivery, the obligations under this
          Agreement, the Other Agreements and the Notes (less any payments,
          which shall not have been themselves invalidated, returned or
          redelivered, made thereon from or in respect of the United States
          Governmental Securities so invalidated, returned or redelivered) shall
          be revived and restored.

     22.9 GAAP.

     Where the character or amount of any asset or liability or item of income
or expense, or any consolidation or other accounting computation is required to
be made for any purpose hereunder, it shall be done in accordance with GAAP as
in effect on the date of, or at the end of the period covered by, the financial
statements from which such asset, liability, item of income, or item of expense,
is derived, or, in the case of any such computation, as in effect on the date as
of which such computation is required to be determined, provided, that if any
term defined herein includes or excludes amounts, items or concepts that would
not be included in or excluded from such term if such term was defined with
reference solely to generally accepted accounting principles, such term will be
deemed to include or exclude such amounts, items or concepts as set forth
herein.

     22.10 Usury.

     It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply with all applicable
usury laws; accordingly, it is agreed that notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary herein or in the Notes, or in any of the documents securing payment
thereof or otherwise relating hereto, no such provision shall require the
payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the highest rate
allowed by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"). If any excess of interest in
such respect is provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so provided for,
herein or in the Notes or in any of the documents securing payment thereof or
otherwise relating hereto, then in such event

          (a) the provisions of this Section 22.10 shall govern and control,

          (b) neither the Company, endorsers or Restricted Subsidiaries, nor
     their heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns nor any other
     party liable for the payment on the Notes, shall be obligated to pay the
     amount of such interest to the extent that it is in excess of the Maximum
     Rate,

          (c) any such excess with respect to any such Note which may have been
     collected shall, at the election of the holder of such Note, be either
     applied as a credit against the then unpaid principal amount on such Note
     or refunded to the Company, and

          (d) the provisions hereof and of the Notes and any documents securing
     payment thereof shall be automatically reformed so that the effective rate
     of interest shall be reduced to the Maximum Rate. For the purpose of
     determining the Maximum Rate, all interest payments with respect hereto
     shall be amortized, prorated and spread throughout the full term of the
     Notes so that the effective rate of interest thereunder is uniform
     throughout the term thereof.

(defined below).

     This Note is one of an issue of Series A Notes of the Company issued in an

<PAGE>

Purchase Agreement, this Note is subject to prepayment, in whole or in part, in
certain cases without a Make-Whole Amount and in other cases with a Make-Whole
Amount. The Company agrees to make required prepayments on account of such Notes
in accordance with the provisions of the Note Purchase Agreement.

     The Notes and all other obligations of the Company under the Note Purchase
Agreement have been unconditionally guarantied by the Restricted Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Guaranty, dated as of December 28, 1995, entered into by such
Restricted Subsidiaries.

     This Note is a registered Note and is transferable, subject to the
restrictions set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement and in the legend above,
only by surrender thereof at the principal office of the Company as specified in
the Note Purchase Agreement, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of this Note or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

     Under certain circumstances, as specified in the Note Purchase Agreement,
the principal of this Note (together with any applicable Make-Whole Amount) may
be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Note Purchase Agreement.

     It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply with all applicable
usury laws; accordingly, it is agreed that notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary herein or in the Note Purchase Agreement, or in any of the documents
securing payment hereof or otherwise relating hereto, no such provision shall
require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the
highest rate allowed by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"). If any excess of
interest in such respect is provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so
provided for, herein or in the Note Purchase Agreement or in any of the
documents securing payment hereof or otherwise relating hereto, then in such
event (a) the provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control, (b) neither
the Company, endorsers or Restricted Subsidiaries, nor their heirs, legal
representatives, successors or assigns nor any other party liable for the
payment hereof, shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the
extent that it is in excess of the Maximum Rate, (c) any such excess which may
have been collected shall, at the election of the holder of this Note, be either
applied as a credit against the then unpaid principal amount hereof or refunded
to the Company, and (d) the provisions hereof and of the Note Purchase Agreement
and any documents securing payment hereof shall be automatically reformed so
that the effective rate of interest shall be reduced to the Maximum Rate. For
the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate, all interest payments with respect
hereto shall be amortized, prorated and spread throughout the full term hereof
so that the effective rate of interest hereunder is uniform throughout the term
hereof.

     THIS NOTE AND THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT ARE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, INTERNAL NEW YORK LAW.

restrictions set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement and in the legend above,
only by surrender thereof at the principal office of the Company as specified in
the Note Purchase Agreement, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of this Note or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

     Under certain circumstances, as specified in the Note Purchase Agreement,
the principal of this Note (together with any applicable Make-Whole Amount) may
be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Note Purchase Agreement.

     It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply with all applicable
usury laws; accordingly, it is agreed that notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary herein or in the Note Purchase Agreement, or in any of the documents
securing payment hereof or otherwise relating hereto, no such provision shall
require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the
highest rate allowed by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"). If any excess of
interest in such respect is provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so
provided for, herein or in the Note Purchase Agreement or in any of the
documents securing payment hereof or otherwise relating hereto, then in such
event (a) the provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control, (b) neither
the Company, endorsers or Restricted Subsidiaries, nor their heirs, legal
representatives, successors or assigns nor any other party liable for the
payment hereof, shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the
extent that it is in excess of the Maximum Rate, (c) any such excess which may
have been collected shall, at the election of the holder of this Note, be either
applied as a credit against the then unpaid principal amount hereof or refunded
to the Company, and (d) the provisions hereof and of the Note Purchase Agreement
and any documents securing payment hereof shall be automatically reformed so
that the effective rate of interest shall be reduced to the Maximum Rate. For
the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate, all interest payments with respect
hereto shall be amortized, prorated and spread throughout the full term hereof
so that the effective rate of interest hereunder is uniform throughout the term
hereof.

          Re:       Seitel, Inc. (the "Company")
                    Our File No. 979275/086

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     Reference is made to the separate Note Purchase Agreements, each dated as
of December 28, 1995 (collectively, the "Note Purchase Agreement"), between the
Company and each of the purchasers listed on Schedule A attached hereto (the
"Purchasers"), which provide, among other things, for the issuance and sale by
the Company of its

          (a) 7.17% Series A Senior Notes due December 30, 2001, in the
     aggregate principal amount of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000),

          (b) 7.17% Series B Senior Notes due December 30, 2002, in the
     aggregate principal amount of Twenty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand
     Dollars ($27,500,000), and

          (c) Series C Senior Notes due December 30, 2002, in the aggregate
     principal amount of Twenty-Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
     ($22,500,000).

The capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings
specified in the Note Purchase Agreement.

     We have acted as special counsel to the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by Note Purchase Agreement. We advise you that we have
previously represented the Company and certain Restricted Subsidiaries only with
respect to specific matters referred to us. Consequently, there are matters of a
legal nature concerning the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries of which we
have no knowledge. This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 4.4(a)
of the Note Purchase Agreement. In acting as such counsel, we have examined:

          (a) the Note Purchase Agreement;

<PAGE>

          (b) the Company's 7.17% Series A Senior Notes due December 30, 2001,
     dated the date hereof, in the form set forth in Exhibit 1A to the Note
     Purchase Agreement, and in the principal amounts, and with the registration
     numbers set forth on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Series
     A Notes");

          (c) the Company's 7.17% Series B Senior Notes due December 30, 2002,
     dated the date hereof, in the form set forth in Exhibit 1B to the Note
     Purchase Agreement, and in the principal amounts, and with the registration
     numbers set forth on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Series
     B Notes");

          (d) the Subsidiary Guaranty executed and delivered by each Restricted
     Subsidiary;

          (e) the compliance certificates of the Company and the Restricted
     Subsidiaries required by Section 4.3 of the Note Purchase Agreement (which
     compliance certificates, together with the Note Purchase Agreement, the
     Series A Notes, the Series B Notes, and the Subsidiary Guaranty, are
     referred to herein collectively as the "Documents");

          (f) the bylaws and minute books of the Company and each Restricted
     Subsidiary incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction within the
     United States, and a certified copy of the certificate or articles of
     incorporation of the Company and each such Restricted Subsidiary, as in
     effect on the date hereof;

          (g) a long-form good standing certificate from the state of
     incorporation of the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary incorporated
     under the laws of any jurisdiction within the United States, and foreign
     good standing certificates for each of such corporations from each of the
     states set forth on Annex 2 hereto;

          (h) a letter to Hebb & Gitlin and Gardere Wynne Sewell & Riggs from
     Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc., describing the manner of the offering of the
     Notes (the "Offeree Letter");

          (i) the opinion of Hebb & Gitlin, counsel to the Purchasers, dated the
     date hereof;

          (j) certificate of officer of the Company and the Restricted
     Subsidiaries, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex 3 (the "Officer's
     Certificate"); and

          (k) originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our
     satisfaction, of such other documents, records, instruments and
     certificates of public officials as we have deemed necessary or appropriate
     to enable us to render this opinion.

     In rendering our opinion, we have relied, to the extent we deem necessary
and proper, on:

<PAGE>

          (a) warranties and representations as to factual matters contained in
     the Note Purchase Agreement and the Subsidiary Guaranty;

          (b) the Officer's Certificate;

          (c) the Offeree Letter; and

          (d) said opinion of Hebb & Gitlin with respect to all matters governed
     by New York law.

     We have no actual knowledge of any material inaccuracies in any of the
facts contained in the Note Purchase Agreement or the Subsidiary Guaranty. We
have made no independent investigations as to the accuracy or completeness of
any factual representation, warranty, data or other information, whether written
or oral, that may have been made by or on behalf of the parties to the
Documents. We have not made any examination of any accounting or financial
matters and express no opinion with respect thereto.

     By accepting this opinion, you are agreeing that in rendering this opinion
we may assume (i) the genuineness of all signatures (except for the signatures
of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries), (ii) the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents
of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, (iii) the
correctness of all statements set forth in certificates or written documents of
governmental officials and certificates or written documents of the Company or
the Restricted Subsidiaries or representatives of the Company or the Restricted
Subsidiaries as to corporate proceedings, incumbency of officers and other
corporate matters (which statements, to our knowledge, are correct), (iv) that
none of the parties upon whom we have relied for purposes of this opinion has
perpetuated a fraud upon any of the parties to the transactions evidenced by the
Documents or any of the attorneys representing any of such parties, (v) that all
of the terms and conditions of, or relating to, the purchase and sale of the
Notes are correctly and completely embodied in the Note Purchase Agreement and
the Schedules thereto, (vi) that the Purchasers will comply with all the terms
and provisions of the Documents including, without limitation, the usury savings
clause contained therein, (vii) that no attorney representing any Purchaser has
any opinion regarding the subject matter of this letter which is contrary to or
inconsistent with any of the opinions expressed herein, and (viii) that the
Purchasers have disbursed or advanced the entire amount due upon issuance of the
Series A Notes and the Series B Notes to the account specified by the Company to
the Purchasers.

     Based on the foregoing, we are of the following opinions:

     1.   (a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
          and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
          all requisite corporate power and authority to own its property and
          carry on its business as currently conducted.

<PAGE>

          (b) Each Restricted Subsidiary incorporated under the laws of any
          jurisdiction within the United States is a corporation duly
          incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
          its state of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
          authority to own its property and carry on its business as currently
          conducted.

     2.   Each of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries that are
          incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction within the United
          States has duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign
          corporation in each jurisdiction where it is shown to be so qualified
          and in good standing in Annex 2 hereto, which jurisdictions, to our
          knowledge, are the only jurisdictions in which the character or
          location of the properties of each such entity (owned, leased or
          licensed) or the nature or conduct of its business makes such
          qualification necessary, except for where the failure to be so
          qualified or in good standing will not in the aggregate have a
          Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
          taken as a whole.

     3.   To the best of our knowledge, in reliance on the Officer's Certificate
          and after inquiry of the lawyers at this firm identified in the third
          from last paragraph of this letter, there is no judgment, order,
          action, suit, proceeding, inquiry, order or investigation, at law or
          in equity, before any court or Governmental Authority, arbitration
          board or tribunal, pending or threatened against the Company or any
          one or more of the Restricted Subsidiaries, except for the actions,
          suits, and proceedings listed on Annex 4 hereto.

     4.   (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to
          execute and deliver the Note Purchase Agreement, the Series A Notes,
          and the Series B Notes, and the Company's obligations under the Note
          Purchase Agreement, the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes may be
          performed in a manner which is within the Company's corporate power
          and authority.

          (b) Each Restricted Subsidiary incorporated under the laws of any
          jurisdiction within the United States has the requisite corporate
          power and authority to execute and deliver the Subsidiary Guaranty and
          each such Restricted Subsidiary's obligations under the Subsidiary
          Guaranty may be performed in a manner which is within such Restricted
          Subsidiary's corporate power and authority.

     5.   (a) Each of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Series A Notes and the
          Series B Notes has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
          action on the part of the Company (no action on the part of the
          stockholders of the Company being required in respect thereof), has
          been executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the
          Company, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
          Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
          terms.1

          (b) The Subsidiary Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary
          corporate action on the part of each of the Restricted Subsidiaries
          incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction within the United

<PAGE>

          States (no action on the part of the stockholders of any such
          Restricted Subsidiary being required in respect thereof), has been
          executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of each Restricted
          Subsidiary, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
          each Restricted Subsidiary, enforceable against each such Restricted
          Subsidiary in accordance with its terms.

     6.   (a) The execution and delivery of the Note Purchase Agreement, the
          Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, and the issue and sale of the
          Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, by the Company will not and the
          obligations of the Company thereunder may be performed in a manner
          which will not conflict with, constitute a violation of, result in a
          breach of any provision of, constitute a default under, or result in
          the creation or imposition of any Lien or encumbrance upon any of the
          property of the Company pursuant to, the certificate of incorporation
          or by-laws of the Company, any applicable statute, rule or regulation
          to which the Company is subject, or, to the best of our knowledge
          based on the Officer's Certificate, any agreement or instrument known
          to us to which the Company is a party or by which its properties may
          be bound, except for (i) such conflicts, violations, breaches,
          defaults or encumbrances under agreements and instruments as may have
          been waived by the other party thereto, or (ii) such conflicts,
          violations, breaches, defaults or encumbrances under agreements and
          instruments which would not have, alone or in the aggregate, a
          Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
          taken as a whole.

          (b) The execution and delivery of the Subsidiary Guaranty by each of
          the Restricted Subsidiaries that are incorporated under the laws of
          any jurisdiction within the United States will not, and the
          obligations of each such Restricted Subsidiary thereunder may be
          performed in a manner which will not, conflict with, constitute a
          violation of, result in a breach of any provision of, constitute a
          default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien or
          encumbrance upon any of the property of any such Restricted
          Subsidiaries pursuant to the certificate or articles of incorporation
          or by-laws of any such Restricted Subsidiary, any applicable statute,
          rule or regulation to which any such Restricted Subsidiary is subject,
          or, to the best of our knowledge based on the Officer's Certificate,
          any agreement or instrument known to us to which any such Restricted
          Subsidiary is a party or by which its respective properties may be
          bound, except for (i) such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults
          or encumbrances under agreements and instruments as may have been
          waived by the other party thereto, or (ii) such conflicts, violations,
          breaches, defaults or encumbrances under agreements and instruments
          which would not have, alone or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
          Effect on the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
          whole.

     7.   All consents, approvals and authorizations of, and all designations,
          declarations, filings, registrations, qualifications and recordations
          with, Governmental Authorities required on the part of the Company and
          the Restricted Subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of any
          jurisdiction within the United States have been obtained in connection
          with the execution and delivery of the Note Purchase Agreement and the
          Subsidiary Guaranty and the issue and sale of the Series A Notes and
          the Series B Notes, except for such informational filings as may be
          required to be made after the issue and sale of the Series A Notes and
          the Series B Notes.

<PAGE>

     8.   The offering, issuance and sale by the Company of the Series A Notes
          and the Series B Notes are exempt from the registration requirements
          under the Securities Act, and the Company is not required to qualify
          an indenture with respect thereto under the Trust Indenture Act of
          1939, as amended.2

     9.   Neither the issuance of the Series A Notes or the Series B Notes, nor
          the intended use of the proceeds of such Notes (as set forth in
          Section 5.14 of the Note Purchase Agreement), will violate Regulations
          G, T or X of the Federal Reserve Board.3

     10.  Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary

          (a) is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
          Company Act of 1940, as amended, or

          (b) is a "holding company" or an "affiliate" of a "holding company,"
          or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or a "public
          utility" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
          of 1935, as amended.

     11.  All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Restricted
          Subsidiary incorporated under the laws of any jurisdiction within the
          United States listed in Schedule 5.4 to the Note Purchase Agreement as
          being owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries have been
          validly issues and are fully paid and nonassessable. To the best of
          our knowledge in reliance on the Officer's Certificate, such shares
          are free and clear in each case of any perfected security interest or
          any other Lien, except as set forth in Schedule 5.4 to the Note
          Purchase Agreement.

          The foregoing opinions are subject to and are qualified in all respect
          by the following:

               (i)   The enforceability of the Documents may be limited by (a)
          bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
          from time to time in effect and affecting creditors' rights or the
          collection of debtors' obligations generally (including, without
          limitation, laws generally defining and restricting fraudulent
          conveyances), (b) principles of equity, (c) principles of public
          policy and (d) requirements of commercial reasonableness and good
          faith.

               (ii)  We express no opinion as to the availability or
          enforceability of certain provisions or remedies set forth in the
          Documents, including but not limited to those (a) that purport to
          provide access to or restrict legal or equitable remedies such as
          specific performance and the appointment of a receiver, (b) that
          purport to establish evidentiary standards, (c) that relate to

<PAGE>

          waivers, or to delays or omissions of enforcement of remedies or
          severance, (d) that attempt to prohibit or restrict the transfer,
          alienation, mortgaging, encumbering or hypothecation of any property
          described in the Documents, (e) that relate to subrogation rights or
          the waiver thereof and (f) that attempt to establish proper venue for
          the filing and maintenance of any claim, suit or action with respect
          to the Documents; provided, however, that such limitations on the
          availability of remedies under the Documents or the legality,
          validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Documents will not,
          in our opinion, substantially interfere with the practical realization
          of the benefits expressed in the Documents except for the economic
          consequences of any procedural delay which may result from such laws.

               (iii) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of
          provisions in the Documents attempting to establish choice of laws.

               (iv)  We express no opinion as to whether the investment in the
          Notes complies with any statutory, regulatory or other loan limits
          applicable to any Purchaser or complies with any other statutes, laws,
          rules or regulations which prescribe permissible and lawful
          investments for the Purchasers (either as to type, amount, percentage
          of total investments or other).

               (v)   With respect to the opinion expressed in 8 above, we have
          specifically assumed (without limiting the generality of our
          assumptions elsewhere herein) that (A) in reliance on the
          representations and warranties of the Purchasers in the Note Purchase
          Agreement, each Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within the
          meaning of Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
          Commission under the Securities Act, (B) in reliance on the Company's
          representations and warranties in the Note Purchase Agreement and on
          Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.'s representations in the Offeree Letter, the
          Company and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. have complied, as applicable,
          with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(v) and (c) of Rule 502 of
          Regulation D in connection with the issuance of the Notes, and (C) the
          issuance by the Company of the Notes will not be integrated with the
          offer or sale of any other securities.

     We acknowledge that this opinion is being issued at the request of the
Company pursuant to Section 4.4(a) of the Note Purchase Agreement and we agree
that the parties listed on Annex 1 hereto may rely and are relying hereon in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Note
Purchase Agreement. Hebb & Gitlin, special counsel to the Purchasers, may rely
on this opinion for the sole purpose of rendering their opinion to be rendered
pursuant to Section 4.4(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement.

     Our "knowledge" as to any matters in connection with this opinion is
limited to the actual knowledge of the lawyers in our firm who have participated
in the negotiation and preparation of the Documents and such other lawyers in
the firm who have represented the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries that
the lawyer in charge of the matter reasonably believes should be consulted, and
does not include constructive or imputed knowledge.

     We are admitted to the Bar in the State of Texas. This opinion is limited
to United States federal law, laws of the State of Texas, and general corporate
law of the State of Delaware, all as now in effect, and we disclaim any
responsibility to inform you of any change thereto after the date hereof. No
opinion is expressed as to any matter that may be governed by the laws of any
other jurisdiction; provided, however, to the extent that the laws of any state
other than Texas govern the Documents, you may rely on our opinion to the extent
that the laws of such state or states are the same as the laws of the State of
Texas, as to which sameness we express no opinion.

     Subsequent holders of the Notes may rely on this opinion as if it were
addressed to them.

                                                                  [Closing Date]

To the Persons Listed on

Annex 1 hereto

       Re: Seitel, Inc. (the "Company")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     Reference is made to the separate Note Purchase Agreements, each dated as
of December 28, 1995 (collectively, the "Note Purchase Agreement"), between the
Company and each of the purchasers listed on Schedule A attached thereto (the
"Purchasers"), which provide, among other things, for the issuance and sale by
the Company of its

          (a) 7.17% Series A Senior Notes due December 30, 2001, in the
     aggregate principal amount of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000),

          (b) 7.17% Series B Senior Notes due December 30, 2002, in the
     aggregate principal amount of Twenty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand
     Dollars ($27,500,000), and

          (c) Series C Senior Notes due December 30, 2002, in the aggregate
     principal amount of Twenty-Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
     ($22,500,000).

The capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings
assigned to them by or pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.

     We have acted as special counsel to the Purchasers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement. This opinion is
delivered to you pursuant to Section 4.4(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement. In
acting as such counsel, we have examined:

          (a) the Note Purchase Agreement;

          (b) the Company's 7.17% Series A Senior Notes due December 30, 2001,
     dated the date hereof, in the form set forth in Exhibit 1A to the Note
     Purchase Agreement, and in the principal amounts and with the registration
     numbers set forth on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Series
     A Notes");

<PAGE>

          (c) the Company's 7.17% Series B Senior Notes due December 30, 2002,
     dated the date hereof, in the form set forth in Exhibit 1B to the Note
     Purchase Agreement, and in the principal amounts and with the registration
     numbers set forth on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Series
     B Notes");4

          (d) the Subsidiary Guaranty executed and delivered by each Restricted
     Subsidiary;

          (e) an Officer's Certificate of the Company, dated the date hereof;

          (f) a certificate of the Secretary of the Company, dated the date
     hereof;

          (g) a certificate of the Secretary of each Restricted Subsidiary
     incorporated under the laws of any state of the United States (each, a
     "U.S. Restricted Subsidiary"), dated the date hereof;

          (h) a letter to Hebb & Gitlin and Gardere Wynne Sewell & Riggs from
     Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc. dated the date hereof, making certain
     representations with respect the manner in which the Notes were offered
     (the "Offeree Letter");

          (i) the opinion of Gardere Wynne Sewell & Riggs, counsel to the
     Company and the U.S. Restricted Subsidiaries, dated the date hereof; and

          (j) originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our
     satisfaction, of such other documents, records, instruments and
     certificates of public officials as we have deemed necessary or appropriate
     to enable us to render this opinion.

     In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that all signatures are genuine,
that all documents submitted to us as originals are genuine, that all copies
submitted to us conform to the originals, that all natural Persons have legal
capacity, and as to documents executed by or on behalf of Persons other than the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries,

          (i) that each such Person executing documents had the power to enter
     into and perform its obligations under such documents, and

          (ii) that such documents have been duly authorized, executed and
     delivered by, and are binding upon and enforceable against, such Persons.

<PAGE>

     In addition, we have assumed that each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary received
fair consideration and reasonably equivalent value in exchange for executing the
Subsidiary Guaranty.

     In rendering our opinion, we have relied, to the extent we deem necessary
and proper, on:

          (a) warranties and representations as to certain factual matters
     contained in the Note Purchase Agreement;

          (b) the Offeree Letter; and

          (c) said opinion of Gardere Wynne Sewell & Riggs with respect to all
     questions governed by Delaware law and with respect to all questions
     concerning the due incorporation, valid existence and good standing of, and
     the authorization, execution and delivery of instruments by, the Company
     and each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary (except that we have made an
     independent examination of a certified copy of the certificate or articles
     of incorporation of the Company and each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary, and
     certificates of officers of the Company and each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary
     setting forth their respective by-laws and corporate resolutions
     authorizing the participation by such entities in the transactions
     contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement and the Subsidiary Guaranty);
     based on such investigation as we have deemed appropriate, said opinion is
     satisfactory in form and scope to us and in our opinion the Purchasers and
     we are justified in relying thereon. As to such opinion and the matters
     therein upon which we are relying, we incorporate herein the assumptions
     and qualifications to such opinion set forth therein.

     Based on the foregoing, we are of the following opinions:

     1.   (a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
          and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

          (b) Each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary is a corporation duly
          incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
          its jurisdiction of incorporation.

     2.   (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
          execute and deliver the Note Purchase Agreement, the Series A Notes
          and the Series B Notes, to issue and sell the Series A Notes and the
          Series B Notes, and to perform its obligations set forth in each of
          the Note Purchase Agreement, the Series A Notes and the Series B
          Notes.5

<PAGE>

          (b) Each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary has all requisite corporate power
          and authority to execute and deliver the Subsidiary Guaranty and to
          perform its obligations set forth in the Subsidiary Guaranty.6

     3.   (a) Each of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Series A Notes and the
          Series B Notes has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
          action on the part of the Company, has been executed and delivered by
          duly authorized officers of the Company, and constitutes a legal,
          valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
          Company in accordance with its terms.7

          (b) The Subsidiary Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary
          corporate action on the part of each of the U.S. Restricted
          Subsidiaries, has been executed and delivered by duly authorized
          officers of each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary, and constitutes a legal,
          valid and binding obligation of each U.S. Restricted Subsidiary,
          enforceable against such U.S. Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with
          its terms.

     4.   (a) The execution and delivery of the Note Purchase Agreement, the
          Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, and the issue and sale of the
          Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, by the Company and the
          performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder will not
          conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of, constitute a
          default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
          upon any of its properties pursuant to, the certificate of
          incorporation or bylaws of the Company.8

<PAGE>

          (b) The execution and delivery of the Subsidiary Guaranty by each of
          the U.S. Restricted Subsidiaries, and the performance by each such
          U.S. Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations thereunder will not
          conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of, constitute a
          default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
          upon any of the properties pursuant to, the certificate or articles of
          incorporation or bylaws of such U.S. Restricted Subsidiary.9

     5.   No consents, approvals or authorizations of governmental authorities
          are required on the part of the Company under the laws of the United
          States of America or the State of New York in connection with the
          execution and delivery of each of the Note Purchase Agreement, the
          Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, and the offer, issue, sale and
          delivery of the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes.10 Our opinion
          in this paragraph 5 is based solely on a review of generally
          applicable laws of the United States of America and New York, and not
          on any search with respect to, or review of, any orders, decrees,
          judgments or other determinations specifically applicable to the
          Company.

     6.   Under existing law, the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes are not
          subject to the registration requirements under the Securities Act of
          1933, as amended or the "Blue Sky" laws of the State of New York, and
          the Company is not required to qualify an indenture with respect
          thereto under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.11

     All opinions herein contained with respect to the enforceability of
     documents and instruments are qualified to the extent that:

<PAGE>

     (a) the availability of equitable remedies, including without limitation,
     specific enforcement and injunctive relief, is subject to the discretion of
     the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought; and

     (b) the enforceability of certain terms provided in the Note Purchase
     Agreement and the Notes may be limited by

          (i) applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency,
          moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
          rights generally as at the time in effect, and

          (ii) common law or statutory requirements with respect to commercial
          reasonableness.

     We express no opinion as to the law of any jurisdiction other than the law
of New York, United States federal law and, in reliance on the opinion of
Gardere Wynne Sewell & Riggs, the law of Delaware and Texas. Gardere Wynne
Sewell & Riggs may rely on this opinion for the sole purpose of rendering their
opinion to be rendered pursuant to Section 4.4(a) of the Note Purchase
Agreement.

     Subsequent holders of the Notes may rely on this opinion as if it were
addressed to them.

                                            Very truly yours,

"Note Purchase Agreement"), each dated as of December 28, 1995, entered into
separately between the Company and, respectively, each of the purchasers of the
Notes named on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Purchasers").

<PAGE>

     1.2  In order to induce the Purchasers to purchase the Notes, the Company
has agreed, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, that the Restricted
Subsidiaries (including each of the Guarantors) will be required to jointly and
severally guaranty unconditionally all of the obligations of the Company under
and in respect of the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to the
terms and provisions hereof.

     1.3  Each Guarantor will receive direct and indirect economic, financial
and other benefits from the indebtedness incurred under the Note Purchase
Agreement and the Notes by the Company, and under this Guaranty, and the
incurrence of such indebtedness is in the best interests of each Guarantor. The
Company and the Guarantors have explicitly induced the Purchasers to purchase
the Notes based upon and in reliance upon the consolidated financial condition
of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Guarantors.

     1.4  All acts and proceedings required by law and by the certificate or
articles of incorporation, as the case may be, and by-laws of each Guarantor
necessary to constitute this Guaranty a valid and binding agreement for the uses
and purposes set forth herein in accordance with its terms have been done and
taken, and the execution and delivery hereof has been in all respects duly
authorized.

     2.   GUARANTY AND OTHER RIGHTS AND UNDERTAKINGS

     2.1  Guarantied Obligations.

     Each Guarantor, in consideration of the execution and delivery of the Note
Purchase Agreement and the purchase of the Notes by the Purchasers, hereby
irrevocably, unconditionally, absolutely, jointly and severally guarantees, on a
continuing basis, to each Noteholder, as and for the Guarantor's own debt, until
final and indefeasible payment has been made:

          (a) the due and punctual payment by the Company of the principal of,
     and interest, and the Make-Whole Amount (if any) on, the Notes at any time
     outstanding and the due and punctual payment of all other amounts payable,
     and all other indebtedness owing, by the Company to the Noteholders under
     the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes, in each case when and as the
     same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, pursuant to
     mandatory or optional prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise, all in
     accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof; it being the
     intent of the Guarantors that the guaranty set forth herein shall be a
     continuing guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection; and

          (b) the punctual and faithful performance, keeping, observance, and
     fulfillment by the Company of all duties, agreements, covenants and
     obligations of the Company contained in the Note Purchase Agreement and the
     Notes.

All of the obligations set forth in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this
Section 2.1 are referred to herein as the "Guarantied Obligations" and the
guaranty thereof contained herein is a primary, original and immediate
obligation of each Guarantor and is an absolute, unconditional, continuing and
irrevocable guaranty of payment and performance and shall remain in full force
and effect until the full, final and indefeasible payment of the Guarantied
Obligations.

<PAGE>

     2.2  Performance Under the Note Purchase Agreement.

     In the event the Company fails to pay, perform, keep, observe, or fulfill
any Guarantied Obligation in the manner provided in the Notes or in the Note
Purchase Agreement, the Guarantors shall cause forthwith to be paid the moneys,
or to be performed, kept, observed, or fulfilled each of such obligations, in
respect of which such failure has occurred in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes. In furtherance of the
foregoing, if an Event of Default shall exist, all of the Guarantied Obligations
shall, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Note
Purchase Agreement for the acceleration of the Notes, forthwith become due and
payable without notice, regardless of whether the acceleration of the Notes
shall be stayed, enjoined, delayed or otherwise prevented.

     2.3  Undertakings in Note Purchase Agreement.

     The Guarantors will comply with each of the undertakings of the Company in
the Note Purchase Agreement in respect of which the Company undertakes to cause
the Guarantors (in their capacities, respectively, as a Guarantor and as a
Restricted Subsidiary) to comply with such undertakings, as if such undertakings
(as they apply to the Guarantors) were set forth at length herein as the
undertakings of the Guarantors.

     2.4  Releases.

     Each Guarantor consents and agrees that, without any notice whatsoever to
or by such Guarantor and without impairing, releasing, abating, deferring,
suspending, reducing, terminating or otherwise affecting the obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder, each Noteholder, by action or inaction, may:

          (a) compromise or settle, renew or extend the period of duration or
     the time for the payment, or discharge the performance of, or may refuse
     to, or otherwise not, enforce, or may, by action or inaction, release all
     or any one or more parties to, any one or more of the Notes, the Note
     Purchase Agreement, any other guaranty or agreement or instrument related
     thereto or hereto;

          (b) assign, sell or transfer, or otherwise dispose of, any one or more
     of the Notes;

          (c) grant waivers, extensions, consents and other indulgences of any
     kind whatsoever to the Company or any Other Guarantor in respect of any one
     or more of the Notes, the Note Purchase Agreement, any other guaranty or
     any agreement or instrument related thereto or hereto;

          (d) amend, modify or supplement in any manner whatsoever and at any
     time (or from time to time) any one or more of the Notes, the Note Purchase
     Agreement, any other guaranty or any agreement or instrument related
     hereto;

          (e) release or substitute any one or more of the endorsers or
     guarantors of the Guarantied Obligations whether parties hereto or not; and

<PAGE>

          (f) sell, exchange, release, surrender or enforce, by action or
     inaction, any property at any time pledged or granted as security in
     respect of the Guarantied Obligations, whether so pledged or granted by the
     Company, such Guarantor or any Other Guarantor, or pursuant to any other
     guaranty or any agreement or instrument related hereto.

     2.5  Waivers.

          To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Guarantor does hereby
     waive:

                     (i)   acceptance of this Guaranty;

               Obligations, subject to such Guarantor's right to make inquiry of
               each Noteholder to ascertain the amount of the Guarantied
               Obligations owing to such Noteholder at any reasonable time,

               limitation, the Note Purchase Agreement, the Notes or any
               agreement or instrument related hereto) by the Company or any
               other Person;

               enforceability of any of the Guarantied Obligations;

                     (vi)    any default, failure or delay, willful or

               or such Guarantor;

                     (vii)   any creditors' rights, bankruptcy, receivership or
               other insolvency proceeding of the Company or such Guarantor, or
               sequestration or seizure of any property of the Company or such
               Guarantor, or any merger, consolidation, reorganization,
               dissolution, liquidation or winding up or change in corporate
               constitution or corporate identity or loss of corporate identity
               of the Company or such Guarantor;

                     (viii)  any disability or other defense of the Company or

               Purchase Agreement or the Notes or any agreement or instrument
               related hereto so that such sums would be rendered inadequate or
               would be unavailable to make the payment as herein provided;

                     (xiii)  any change in the ownership of the equity
               securities of the Company, such Guarantor or any other Person
               liable in respect of the Notes; or

                     (xiv)   any other action, happening, event or reason
               whatsoever that shall delay, interfere with, hinder or prevent,

               such Guarantor of any of its obligations under the Note Purchase
               Agreement, the Notes or this Guaranty.

     2.6  Waivers of Subrogation, Reimbursement and Indemnity.

     No Guarantor shall have any right of subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnity whatsoever in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, or any right of
recourse to or with respect to any assets or property of the Company.

     2.7  Invalid Payments.

     To the extent the Company makes a payment or payments to any Noteholder,
which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required, for any of the
foregoing reasons or for any other reason, to be repaid or paid over to a
custodian, trustee, receiver or any other party or officer under any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or
liquidation law of any jurisdiction, state or federal law, or any common law or
equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the obligation
or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if said payment had not been made and each Guarantor shall
be primarily liable for such obligation.

<PAGE>

     2.8  Marshaling.

     Neither any Noteholder nor any Person acting for the benefit of any
Noteholder shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any
Guarantor or against or in payment of any or all of the Guarantied Obligations.

     2.9  Setoff, Counterclaim or Other Deductions.

     Except as otherwise required by law, each payment by any Guarantor shall be
made without setoff, counterclaim or other deduction.

     2.10 Election by Guarantors to Perform Obligations.

     Any election by the Guarantor to pay or otherwise perform any of the
obligations of the Company under the Notes, the Note Purchase Agreement or any
agreement or instrument related hereto shall not release the Company, the
Guarantor or any Other Guarantor from such obligations or any of such Person's
other obligations under the Notes, the Note Purchase Agreement or any agreement
or instrument related hereto.

     2.11 No Election of Remedies by Noteholders.

     To the extent provided in the Note Purchase Agreement, each Noteholder
shall, individually or collectively, have the right to seek recourse against
each Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for herein for such Guarantor's
obligations under this Guaranty in respect of the Guarantied Obligations. No
election to proceed in one form of action or proceeding, or against any party,
or on any obligation, shall constitute a waiver of such Noteholder's right to
proceed in any other form of action or proceeding or against other parties
(including, without limitation, any Other Guarantor) unless such Noteholder has
expressly waived such right in writing. Specifically, but without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no action or proceeding by any Noteholder against
the Company or any Guarantor under any document or instrument evidencing
obligations of the Company or such Guarantor to such Noteholder shall serve to
diminish the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, except to the
extent that such Noteholder finally and unconditionally shall have realized
payment by such action or proceeding in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.

     2.12 Separate Action; Other Enforcement Rights.

     Each of the rights and remedies granted under this Guaranty to each
Noteholder in respect of the Notes held by such Noteholder may be exercised by
such Noteholder without notice by such Noteholder to, or the consent of or any
other action by, any other Noteholder. Each Noteholder may proceed to protect
and enforce this Guaranty by suit or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or
in bankruptcy, and whether for the specific performance of any covenant or
agreement contained herein or in execution or aid of any power herein granted or
for the recovery of judgment for the obligations hereby guarantied or for the
enforcement of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy available under
applicable law.

     2.13 Noteholder Setoff.

     Each Noteholder shall have, to the fullest extent permitted by law and this
Guaranty, a right of set-off against any and all credits and any and all other
property of each or all of the Guarantors, now or at any time whatsoever, with
or in the possession of, such Noteholder, or anyone acting for such Noteholder,
to ensure the full performance of any and all obligations of the Guarantors
hereunder.

<PAGE>

     2.14 Delay or Omission; No Waiver.

     No course of dealing on the part of any Noteholder and no delay or failure
on the part of any such Person to exercise any right hereunder shall impair such
right or operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice such Person's
rights, powers and remedies hereunder. Every right and remedy given by this
Guaranty or by law to any Noteholder may be exercised from time to time as often
as may be deemed expedient by such Person.

     2.15 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

     If any Noteholder shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right
or remedy under this Guaranty or under any Note held by such Noteholder, and
such proceeding shall have been dismissed, discontinued or abandoned for any
reason, or shall have been determined adversely to such Noteholder, then and in
every such case each such Noteholder, the Company and each Guarantor shall,
except as may be limited or affected by any determination (including, without
limitation, any determination in connection with any such dismissal) in such
proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to its respective former
positions hereunder and thereunder, and thereafter, subject as aforesaid, the
rights and remedies of such Noteholders shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been instituted.

     2.16 Cumulative Remedies.

     No remedy under this Guaranty, the Note Purchase Agreement or the Notes is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every remedy shall be
cumulative and in addition to any and every other remedy given pursuant to this
Guaranty, the Note Purchase Agreement or the Notes.

     2.17 Limitation on Guarantied Obligations.

     It is the intention of each Guarantor and each Noteholder that the maximum
amount of the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder shall be equal to, but not
in excess of, the amount equal to the lesser of

     (a) the Guarantied Obligations, and

     (b) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law.

To that end, with respect to the determination of the "maximum amount permitted
by applicable law," but only to the extent such obligations would otherwise be
avoidable, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the
maximum amount that, after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, would not
render such Guarantor insolvent or unable to pay its debts (within the meaning
of Title 11 of the United States Code or as defined in the analogous applicable
law) as they mature or leave such Guarantor with an unreasonably small capital.
The need for any such limitation shall be determined, and any such needed
limitation shall be effective, at the time or times that such Guarantor is
deemed, under applicable law, to incur obligations hereunder. Any such
limitation shall be apportioned among the Guarantied Obligations owed to the
Noteholders pro rata. This Section 2.17 is intended solely to preserve the
rights of each Noteholder hereunder to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, and neither the Guarantors nor any other Person shall have any
rights under this Section 2.17 that it would not otherwise have under applicable
law. For the purposes of this Section 2.17, "insolvency", "unreasonably small
capital" and "inability to pay debts (as so defined) as they mature" shall be
determined in accordance with applicable law.

<PAGE>

     2.18 Maintenance of Offices.

     The Guarantors will maintain an office at the address set forth in Section
5.3 where notices, presentations and demands in respect of this Guaranty may be
made upon them. Such office will be maintained at such address until such time
as any Guarantor shall notify the Noteholders of any change of location of such
office.

     2.19 Further Assurances.

     Each Guarantor will cooperate with the Noteholders and execute such further
instruments and documents as the Required Holders shall reasonably request to
carry out, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Required Holders, the
transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreements, the Notes, this
Guaranty and the documents and instruments related thereto.

     2.20 Pari Passu.

     Each Guarantor covenants that its obligations under this Guaranty do and
will rank at least pari passu with all its other present and future unsecured
Senior Debt.

4.   WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS

     Each Guarantor represents and warrants to each Purchaser, as of the date of
effectiveness hereof, as follows:

     4.1  Generally.

          (a) Such Guarantor is fully aware of the financial condition of the
     Company. Such Guarantor delivers this Guaranty based solely upon its own
     independent investigation and in no part upon any representation or
     statement of any one or more Noteholders with respect thereto. Such
     Guarantor is in a position to obtain, and hereby assumes full
     responsibility for obtaining, any additional information concerning the
     financial condition of the Company as such Guarantor may deem material to
     its obligations hereunder, and such Guarantor is not relying upon, nor
     expecting, any Noteholder to furnish it any information concerning the
     financial condition of the Company.

          (b) As of the date of the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the
     fair salable value of the assets of such Guarantor, taken as a whole,
     exceeds its liabilities, taken as a whole; such Guarantor is able to pay
     and discharge all of its debts (including, without limitation, its current
     liabilities) as they become due and after giving effect to the transactions
     contemplated by this Guaranty, such Guarantor will not become unable to pay
     and discharge such debts as they become due; there are no presently pending
     material court or administrative proceedings or undischarged judgments
     against such Guarantor; and no tax liens have been filed or threatened
     against such Guarantor, nor is such Guarantor in default or claimed default
     under any agreement for borrowed money.

          (c) Such Guarantor is a corporation duly organized and validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
     incorporation. Such Guarantor has the corporate power to own its properties
     and carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Such Guarantor has
     the valid authority and the corporate power to enter into and perform, and
     has taken all necessary action to authorize its entry into, and the
     performance and delivery of, this Guaranty and the transactions
     contemplated hereby.

<PAGE>

          (d) This Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary action on
     the part of such Guarantor, has been duly executed and delivered by duly
     authorized officers of such Guarantor, and constitutes a legal, valid and
     binding obligation of such Guarantor.

          (e) The entry into and performance of this Guaranty and the
     transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not conflict with any
     applicable law or regulation or official or judicial order, conflict with
     the articles or certificate of incorporation, as the case may be, or
     by-laws, of such Guarantor, conflict with any agreement or document to
     which such Guarantor is a party or that is binding upon it or any of its
     properties, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of
     its properties pursuant to the provisions of any agreement or document.

     4.2  Nature of Business of Company and Restricted Subsidiaries.

          The Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries have sought and obtained
     the Note Purchase Agreement, the sale of the Notes and the related
     transactions based upon their consolidated financial position and the
     Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries understand that the Purchasers are
     relying upon the consolidated financial condition of the Company and the
     Restricted Subsidiaries in purchasing the Notes. Nothing herein shall be
     deemed to prohibit any transfer by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
     of any of its or a Subsidiary's stock otherwise permitted under the terms
     and provisions of the Note Purchase Agreement.

     4.3  Solvency.

          The fair value of the business and assets of each of the Company and
     the Guarantors exceeds the amount that will be required to pay its
     liabilities (including, without limitation, contingent, subordinated,
     unmatured and unliquidated liabilities on existing debts, as such
     liabilities may become absolute and matured), in each case after giving
     effect to the transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement, the
     Notes and this Guaranty, including, without limitation, the provisions of
     Section 2.17. None of the Guarantors nor the Company, after giving effect
     to the transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement, the
     Notes and this Guaranty, will be insolvent or will be engaged in any
     business or transaction, or about to engage in any business or transaction,
     for which such Person has unreasonably small assets or capital (within the
     meaning of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, the Uniform Fraudulent
     Conveyance Act and Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code), and
     none of the Guarantors nor the Company has any intent to hinder, delay or
     defraud any entity to which it is, or will become, on or after the date of
     the Closing, indebted or incur debts that would be beyond its ability to
     pay as they mature.
