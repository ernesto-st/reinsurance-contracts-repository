after such Person has become a Decline. Sears shall (i)&nbsp;only use the Sears
brand in connection with such source of credit in a manner that would not be
reasonably expected to create consumer confusion between such product and Sears
Credit Cards; and (ii)&nbsp;shall not promote such products in the Stores. Sears
agrees that applications for such alternative credit product shall be separate
from the applications for Sears Credit Cards, and shall only be accessible or
distributed to Declines. In the event Sears elects to offer such source of
credit, Sears and Purchaser shall cooperate to establish a mechanism,

the results of Purchaser&#146;s tests of such plan. Sears acknowledges and agrees
that Purchaser may make changes to its disaster recovery plan from time to time
without Sears&#146; consent; provided, that such changes do not materially decrease
the level of protection offered by the disaster recovery plan. Purchaser shall
permit Sears to review any updated, revised, amended or restated disaster
recovery plan as soon as it becomes available. If Sears identifies a potential
disaster that Purchaser&#146;s disaster recovery plan does not reasonably
anticipate, such potential disaster shall be considered by the Program
Committee and, if applicable, the Program Committee shall recommend an
appropriate course of action. The performance of such tests and the resolution
of any issues or problems identified in such test shall be performed at the

Purchaser shall maintain information security policies and procedures that
include administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to (i)

protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of
such Confidential Information; and (iii)&nbsp;protect against unauthorized access

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1 Use of Sears Licensed Marks. Pursuant to the Licensing Agreement,
and on the terms and subject to the conditions therein set forth, Sears IP Sub

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2 Covenant Not to Sue; License. Sears agrees that it shall not enforce
any Patents it owns or controls against Purchaser, or any Person acting on
Purchaser&#146;s behalf (in accordance with this Agreement) where any such party is
acting pursuant to the Program Related Agreements. The foregoing does not
represent an acknowledgement by Purchaser that any Patents of Sears is valid or
that Purchaser requires a license to any Patents of Sears. In the event that Purchaser determines that it requires a license to the
Sears &#145;868 Patent for use outside the Program, Sears will license the Sears

negotiated by Sears and Purchaser.

Solicitation Materials prepared by Sears, to the extent required for promoting
the Program and soliciting new Accounts and Financial Product accounts; (ii)&nbsp;in
the form and manner in which Purchaser provides the Licensed Purchaser Marks to
Sears; and (iii)&nbsp;as Purchaser approves in advance in writing. Purchaser shall
respond promptly to all requests for Licensed Purchaser Marks approval,
provided, that Purchaser&#146;s failure to provide a prompt response to any such
request shall not be deemed (A)&nbsp;a breach of this Agreement and (B)&nbsp;a consent
for Sears to use the Licensed Purchaser Marks as requested. To assure the use
and maintenance of high standards of quality, workmanship, style and appearance
and the proper use of the Licensed Purchaser Marks, Sears shall adhere to
Purchaser&#146;s written guidelines with respect to all Solicitation Materials
prepared by Sears that contain Licensed Purchaser Marks. Sears agrees to
provide Purchaser, from time to time and upon Purchaser&#146;s request, with a
reasonable number of samples of any Solicitation Materials publicly
disseminated or intended for public dissemination by Sears or its Subsidiaries
which utilize the Licensed Purchaser Marks. If Purchaser determines, after
reviewing the proposed Solicitation Materials bearing Licensed Purchaser Marks,
that it disapproves of such materials, Purchaser shall so advise Sears, and
such materials shall not be printed or used, as the case may be, until
appropriate corrective action is taken to the reasonable satisfaction of
Purchaser. After any Solicitation Materials have been approved by Purchaser

Sears in writing that it disapproves of any particular use of the Licensed
Purchaser Marks that had previously been approved, Sears shall, in Purchaser&#146;s
discretion, either (i)&nbsp;phase out such usage in the ordinary course of business;
or (ii)&nbsp;promptly cease such usage or otherwise cure such disapproved use;
provided, that Purchaser (x)&nbsp;sets forth, with specificity, a good faith
reasonable basis for such disapproval; and (y)&nbsp;agrees to reimburse Sears for
the reasonable replacement costs, if any, of such affected materials.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.5 Infringement Proceedings. Sears shall promptly notify Purchaser of
any unauthorized use of, or claims of infringement against, the Licensed Purchaser Marks. Purchaser shall have
the sole right and discretion to bring or defend against proceedings alleging
infringement or dilution of or by its Marks or other Intellectual Property, or
unfair competition related thereto, pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that Sears agrees to provide Purchaser with its reasonable cooperation

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.6 Purchaser Ownership Rights. Sears acknowledges and agrees that,

Intellectual Property for the Program shall be approved of in advance by the
Program Committee. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the
Program Committee shall also determine in advance the respective rights of the
parties with respect to such New Intellectual Property, and may determine that
any New Intellectual Property jointly developed by Purchaser and Sears in
connection with the Program shall be owned jointly and equally by Purchaser and
Sears (&#147;Jointly Developed Intellectual Property&#148;). Any filings or other
actions necessary to protect such Jointly Developed Intellectual Property shall
be filed jointly by Purchaser and Sears, and shall identify both such parties
as the owners. Purchaser and Sears shall cooperate fully, and cause their
employees to cooperate fully, with each other in the filing of any such filings
or actions and, except as may be otherwise agreed by the parties in writing,
shall share equally all costs and expenses relating to any such filings or actions approved by the parties.
In the event that either Purchaser or Sears (or Sears IP Sub) declines to fund
its portion of the costs incurred in connection with any such filings or other
actions, the other party may proceed on its own with such filings or other
actions, and will own the resulting intellectual property as New Intellectual
Property subject to this Section&nbsp;6.7.

of the other party, or in any Marks that contain Intellectual Property of the

Property containing another party&#146;s Intellectual Property.

otherwise by the Program Committee in accordance with Section&nbsp;6.7, upon the

shall, upon the exercise of the Repurchase Option, have a right to receive a

Property.

scheduled expiration without a breach (at Purchaser&#146;s option and expense
(including through the payment of any termination fees or liabilities),
including, at Purchaser&#146;s option, as part of an offer by Purchaser to purchase
the New Portfolio); or (B)&nbsp;providing notice of non-renewal of such Conflicting
Agreement. In the event such Conflicting Agreement cannot be terminated as set
forth above, the New Portfolio shall remain outside the Program. At such time
as the Conflicting Agreement is no longer in effect (but subject to any terms
of such agreement), Section&nbsp;8.5(a) shall apply.

long-term debt rating of at least B&#043; from Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings and B1 from
Moody&#146;s Investors Service at a time when such ratings for Sears are being
published; (ii)&nbsp;fails to maintain a Fixed Charge Ratio of at least 2.0x for two
consecutive calendar quarters; or (iii)&nbsp;allows a violation of a material
covenant in any bank credit agreement of Sears to remain uncured for 90&nbsp;days,
then Purchaser may establish reserves on its books that shall be funded by
Sears for Sears&#146; contingent liabilities relating to the performance of its
duties under the Program (i.e., non-delivery of Merchandise, timely processing
of In-Store Payments, warranty obligations, credit returns, chargebacks or
other such similar obligations under the Program), which reserve shall not
exceed 2.5% of the amount of annual in-store Sears Credit Card purchases as of
the last date such amount was measured. Purchaser may access and use such
reserves at its discretion to discharge Sears&#146; obligations under the Program.
At Sears&#146; option, it may satisfy the reserve obligation by delivery to

measured during any twelve-month period from those Stores and Third Party Sears
Merchant stores that are substantially similar in format or concept to the
Stores and Third Party Sears Merchant stores that existed as of the Effective
Date (&#147;Sears Merchandise Sales&#148;) are less than the Merchandise Decline Amount;
or (ii)&nbsp;that portion of Sears Merchandise Sales representing sales of hard-line
goods (e.g., appliances, tools, electronics, furniture), measured during any
twelve-month period (&#147;Sears Hard Line Sales&#148;), are less than the Hardline
Decline Amount, in either case for reasons other than General Conditions (the
occurrence of either or both events, a &#147;Significant Sales Contraction&#148;) and
that portion of Sears Merchandise Sales that were charged on a Sears Credit
Card are less than the Sales Contraction Amount during the same twelve-month
period (&#147;Credit Sales Contraction&#148;), then Purchaser may give notice to Sears of
Purchaser&#146;s desire to negotiate in good faith modifications to the terms of
this Agreement, with the specific goal of modifying this Agreement such that
Purchaser earns additional profits representing what it would have earned on
the smaller of (A)&nbsp;the Merchandise Decline Amount less the Sears Merchandise
Sales and (B)&nbsp;Hardline Decline Amount less the Sears Hard-Line Sales, assuming
for purposes of such calculation that the Significant Sales Contraction had not
occurred, and covering the time period beginning on the later of the date of
the beginning of such Significant Sales Contraction and the date of the
beginning of such Credit Sales Contraction, and ending on the date when such
Significant Sales Contraction is no longer occurring or such Credit Sales
Contraction is no longer occurring (such beginning and ending times being
deemed to occur at the beginning or the end, respectively, of the month in
which such condition is met). Purchaser shall specify the date on which the
negotiations shall begin, which date shall be not less than ten nor more than
30 Business Days after the date on which such notice is given, and Purchaser
and Sears shall have 180 calendar days to negotiate mutually agreeable changes
to this Agreement (the &#147;Negotiation Period&#148;). During negotiations, the parties
will take into account trends, and shall take into account the possibility that
the conditions in the next sentence have been met. In the event that the
Significant Sales Contraction and Credit Sales Contraction described above have
been reversed, and remain so for a period of six months or more, Sears may
request that Purchaser engage in good faith renegotiation of the previously
negotiated terms, taking into account Sears performance under this provision.
Concurrent with the delivery of the notice by Purchaser to Sears, Purchaser&#146;s
obligation to pay the amounts under the caption &#147;Growth Incentives&#148; on Schedule
7.1 shall cease, unless and until such time as the parties agree upon changes
to this Agreement. If Purchaser and Sears are unable to agree on changes to
this Agreement before the end of the Negotiation Period, the Agreement shall

of facts that, if not corrected, would give rise to a right of indemnification
of a party hereunder (&#147;Indemnified Party&#148;) by the other party (&#147;Indemnifying
Party&#148;), the Indemnified Party will give written notice to the Indemnifying
Party as promptly as practicable, but, in the case of lawsuit, in no event
later than the time necessary to enable the Indemnifying Party to file a timely
answer to the complaint; provided that failure to give timely notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent it is actually prejudiced thereby. Such written notice shall describe
such claim in reasonable detail including the sections of this Agreement which
form the basis for such claim. The Indemnified Party shall make available to
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel and accountants at reasonable times and
for reasonable periods, during normal business hours, all books and records of
the Indemnified Party relating to any such possible claim for indemnification,
and each party hereunder will render to the other such assistance as it may
reasonably require of the other (at the expense of the party requesting
assistance) in order to insure prompt and adequate defense of any suit, claim
or proceeding based upon a state of facts that may give rise to a right of
indemnification hereunder.

writing the owner of such Intellectual Property. As among the parties hereto,
such owner shall then have the sole and exclusive right, but not the
obligation, to initiate action in order to remedy the infringement at its
expense and to retain any recovery therefrom. Upon the

owner in connection with such action, but at the expense of such owner.

right to defend, or to direct the defense of, any such suit, claim or
proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party via
facsimile transmission, with a copy by mail, within thirty days (or sooner, if
the nature of the claim so requires) of having been notified pursuant to
Section&nbsp;11.3(a), whether the Indemnifying Party elects to employ counsel and
assume the defense of any such claim, suit or action. If the Indemnifying
Party does not timely notify the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
the defense (after a second notice has been given any time within or after the
time period described above), the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any
determination in such suit, claim or proceeding or any compromise or settlement
effected by the Indemnified Party, provided that the Indemnified Party shall

fully advised of the status thereof. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ its own counsel if the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume
such defense, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the

counsel to represent both parties (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the
Indemnified Party); or (iii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed
counsel to take charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time
after electing to assume the defense thereof, and in any of such events such
reasonable fees and expenses shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party.

claim or proceeding (i)&nbsp;unless it indemnifies the Indemnified Party for all
Losses arising out of or relating thereto and (ii)&nbsp;that includes an admission
of liability of the Indemnified Party or seeks any material non-monetary
relief, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any final judgment or decree entered in
any claim, suit or action for which the Indemnifying Party did not assume the
defense in accordance herewith shall be deemed to have been consented to by,
and shall (subject to the other provisions hereof) be binding upon, the
Indemnifying Party as fully as if the Indemnifying Party had assumed the
defense thereof and a final judgment or decree had been entered in such claim,
suit or action, or with regard to such claim, suit or action by a court of
competent jurisdiction for the amount of such settlement, compromise, judgment

nomination by the other party, each of Sears and Purchaser shall advise the
other party that they either accept or challenge the other party&#146;s selection of
Independent Appraiser. In the event that either party objects to the
Independent Appraiser nominated by the other party, the parties will negotiate
in good faith to resolve such difference promptly and, in the event that no
resolution is obtained within fifteen days after the date of notice of any
objection to any nominated Independent Appraiser is given, either party may
initiate arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section&nbsp;14.24 herein. If both of
the nominated Independent Appraisers are acceptable, each of Sears and
Purchaser shall promptly retain their respective nominated Independent
Appraisers and provide such information to both Independent Appraisers as is
necessary to permit each of the Independent Appraisers to provide a valuation
of the Sears Repurchase Assets no later than a date selected by the parties for
such purpose (which date will be not later than 45&nbsp;days after the date on which
the parties have agreed on the designation of the Independent Appraisers);
provided, that the information provided to both Independent Appraisers shall be
identical. Such appraisals shall be performed on the basis of the assumptions
set forth in Schedule&nbsp;13.5(c). The fair market value shall be the average of
the valuations received from the Independent Appraisers, and such averaged
valuation shall not be subject to Section&nbsp;14.24 and shall be final and binding

valuations made by the two Independent Appraisers differ by more than an amount
equal to 2.5% of the lesser of the two valuations (such difference, &#147;De Minimis
Difference&#148;). If the valuations made by the two Independent Appraisers differ
by more than a De Minimis Difference, such Independent Appraisers will jointly
select a third Independent Appraiser of recognized standing and experience in
valuing credit card portfolios, who shall be retained jointly and compensated
jointly and equally by Sears and Purchaser. If the two Independent Appraisers
fail to jointly agree on a third Independent Appraiser within fifteen days of
the receipt by both parties of the evaluation of the other party&#146;s Independent
Appraiser, at the request of any party, such Independent Appraiser shall be
selected by the CPR within fifteen days of such request. Such third
Independent Appraiser will provide a valuation of the Sears Repurchase Assets
as of the appraisal date selected by the parties (as described above) using the
same information that was made available to the initial two Independent
Appraisers, and based upon the assumptions set forth in Schedule&nbsp;13.5(c). If
(i)&nbsp;the initial valuations delivered by the initial two Independent Appraisers
differ by an amount equal to or less than 4% of the lesser of the two initial
valuations; and (ii)&nbsp;the valuation delivered by the third Independent Appraiser
is between the two initial valuations delivered by the initial two Independent
Appraisers or differs from either of such valuations by any amount equal to or
less than a De
Minimis Difference, the fair market value will be the average of the three
appraisals, and such averaged valuation shall be final and binding on the
parties and enforceable in any court having jurisdiction. If (i)&nbsp;the initial
valuations delivered by the initial two Independent Appraisers differ by an
amount equal to or less than 4% of the lesser of the two initial valuations and
the third appraisal is not between the two initial valuations delivered by the
initial two Independent Appraisers and differs from both of such valuations by

in contract or tort) between or among the parties arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the breach, termination or validity thereof (&#147;Dispute&#148;)

of the time period set forth in Section&nbsp;14.23(b), if applicable, at the request
of any party (with Sears and Sears IP Sub being considered one party for
purposes of this Section) be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the
CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration (the &#147;Rules&#148;) of the CPR Institute
for Dispute Resolution (the &#147;CPR&#148;) then in effect, except as modified herein,
by notifying the other parties of its election to arbitrate such controversy,
dispute or claim in accordance with the Rules.
</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Each Dispute submitted by a party to arbitration shall be heard by an
arbitration panel composed of three neutral and impartial arbitrators, each of
whom shall have relevant business experience or be otherwise experienced to
judge such dispute or claim. Sears and Purchaser shall each appoint one such
arbitrator within fifteen days after the receipt by the respondent of the
notice of arbitration. If either party fails to appoint its arbitrator within
such fifteen-day period, any party may apply to the CPR to appoint an
arbitrator on behalf of the party that has failed to appoint its arbitrator.
The two arbitrators appointed by or on behalf of (as the case may be) the
parties shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator, who shall chair the
arbitration panel (the &#147;Chairman&#148;). If the
arbitrators appointed by or on behalf of the parties do not agree on a
Chairman within fifteen days after the latter of the two arbitrators appointed
by or on behalf of the parties has been appointed, the Chairman shall, at the
request of either party, be appointed by the CPR. Any Chairman appointed by
the CPR shall be a retired judge or an attorney admitted to practice for at
least fifteen years with experience in the arbitration of complex commercial
cases. If for any reason an arbitrator is unable to perform his or her
function, he or she shall be replaced and a substitute shall be appointed in
the same manner as the arbitrator replaced was appointed.

conducted in accordance with the procedures of the CPR. In any arbitration
proceeding hereunder (i)&nbsp;proceedings shall, unless otherwise agreed by the
parties, be held in Chicago, Illinois; (ii)&nbsp;the arbitration panel shall have no
power to award punitive damages and shall be bound by all statutes of
limitation that would otherwise be applicable in a judicial action brought by a
party; and (iii)&nbsp;the decision of a majority of the arbitrators (or the Chairman
if there is no such majority) shall be final and binding on the parties and
shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties
hereby waive any rights to appeal or to review of such decision by any court or
tribunal and also waive any objections to such enforcement.

arbitration proceeding may be sent to the parties by registered or certified

personal service is hereby waived. The arbitrators may award recovery of all
costs and fees incurred in connection with the arbitration and the proceeding,

reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and expenses and arbitrators&#146; fees and expenses and
court costs, in each case, with respect to such disputed matter) to the party
