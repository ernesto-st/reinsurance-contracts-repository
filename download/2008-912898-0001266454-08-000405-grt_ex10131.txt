     Lender to make a Loan to be made by such other Lender.

          (4) Notes.

recorded by such Lender on its books and, prior to any transfer of the Note held
by it, endorsed by such Lender on the schedule attached to such Note or any
continuation thereof; provided that the failure of such Lender to make any such
recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of Borrower to make
a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder or under such Note in respect
of such Loans.

Lender, Borrower agrees to so substitute or exchange any Notes and enter into
note splitter agreements in connection therewith).

loss, theft or destruction of any Note, upon Borrower's receipt of a reasonably
satisfactory indemnification agreement executed in favor of Borrower by the
holder of such Note, or in the event of the mutilation of any Note, upon the

shall execute and deliver to such holder a new replacement Note in lieu of the
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.

Administrative Agent will promptly make such Loans available to Borrower by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account in the United States
designated by the Borrower in writing.

     Section 2.2 Conversions or Continuations of Loans.

          (1) Subject to Sections 2.8(4), 2.9(2) and 2.9(3), Borrower shall have
     the right to Convert Loans of one Type into Loans of another Type or
     Continue Loans of one Type as Loans of the same Type, at any time or from
     time to time; provided that: (a) Borrower shall give Administrative Agent
     notice of each such Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section
     2.8(5); (b) LIBOR-based Loans may be Converted only on the last day of an
     Interest Period for such Loans unless Borrower complies with the terms of
     Section 2.9(5) and (c) subject to Sections 2.9(1) and 2.9(3), any
     Conversion or Continuation of Loans shall be pro rata among the Lenders.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting the rights and remedies
     of Administrative Agent and the Lenders under Article 11, in the event that
     any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Administrative Agent
     may (and at the request of the Majority Lenders shall) suspend the right of
     Borrower to Convert any Loan into a LIBOR-based Loan, or to Continue any
     Loan as a LIBOR-based Loan for so long as such Event of Default has
     occurred and is continuing, in which event all Loans shall be Converted (on
     the last day(s) of the respective Interest Periods therefor) or Continued,
     as the case may be, as Base Rate Loans. In connection with any such
     Conversion, a Lender may (at its sole and absolute discretion) transfer a
     Loan from one Applicable Lending Office to another.

          (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
     Agreement, at any time that a Hedge Agreement is in effect, Borrower shall
     have the right to choose only an Interest Period which is the same as the
     Interest Rate Hedge Period.

     Section 2.3 Interest Rate; Late Charge.

          (1) Borrower hereby promises to pay to Administrative Agent for
     account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan
     (which may be Base Rate Loans and/or LIBOR-based Loans) made by such Lender
     for the period from and including the date of such Loan to but excluding
     the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

     (a) during such periods as such Loan is an Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate
plus the Applicable Margin; and

     (b) during such periods as such Loan is a LIBOR-based Loan, for each
Interest Period relating thereto, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Loan for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.

          (2) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable (i) monthly in
     arrears on each Payment Date and (ii) in the case of any Loan, upon the
     payment or prepayment thereof or the Conversion of such Loan to a Loan of
     another Type (but only on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or
     Converted), except that interest payable at the Default Rate shall be
     payable from time to time on demand as provided in this Agreement and the
     other Loan Documents.

          (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, after
     the Maturity Date and during any period when an Event of Default exists and
     is continuing, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account
     of each Lender interest at the applicable Default Rate on the outstanding
     principal amount of any Loan made by such Lender, any interest payments
     (except a late payment of any Additional Interest which shall be governed
     by the terms of the Hedge Agreement) thereon not paid when due and on any
     other amount payable by Borrower hereunder, under the Notes and any other
     Loan Documents.

          (4) Promptly after the determination of any interest rate provided for
     herein or any change therein, Administrative Agent shall give notice
     thereof to the Lenders to which such interest is payable and to Borrower,
     but the failure of Administrative Agent to provide such notice shall not
     affect Borrower's obligation for the payment of interest on the Loans.

          (5) In addition to any sums due under this Section 2.3, Borrower shall
     pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders a late payment
     premium in the amount of (a) three percent (3%) of any payment of principal
     under the Loans due on the Maturity Date that is made after the Maturity
     Date, and (b) five percent (5%) of (i) any payments of principal under the
     Loans (other than the principal payment due on the Maturity Date) made
     after the due date thereof, and (ii) any payments of interest or other sums
     under the Loans (other than the principal payment due on the Maturity Date)
     made more than five (5) days after the due date thereof, which late payment
     premium, in each case, shall be due with any such late payment or upon
     demand by Administrative Agent. Such late payment charge represents the


                                       30
<PAGE>

     reasonable estimate of Borrower and the Lenders of a fair average
     compensation for the loss that may be sustained by the Lenders due to the
     failure of Borrower to make timely payments. Such late charge shall be paid
     without prejudice to the right of Administrative Agent and the Lenders to
     collect any other amounts provided herein or in the other Loan Documents to
     be paid or to exercise any other rights or remedies under the Loan
     Documents.

          (6) Borrower shall pay Additional Interest under the Notes in
     accordance with the terms of the Hedge Agreement.

     Section 2.4 Terms of Payment. The Loans shall be payable as follows:

          (1) Interest. On the date hereof, Borrower shall make a payment of
     interest only (covering the period from the date hereof through and
     including June 30, 2008 (the "Stub Interest Period"), and beginning on
     August 1, 2008 and on each Payment Date thereafter, Borrower shall pay
     interest in arrears on each such Payment Date in accordance with the wire
     transfer instructions set forth in Schedule 2.4(1) hereto (or such other
     instructions as Administrative Agent may from time to time provide) until
     all amounts due under the Loan Documents are paid in full.

          (2) Principal Amortization. In the event the Maturity Date is extended
     pursuant to Section 2.5, then, on the first Payment Date occurring during
     the First Extension Period and on each Payment Date thereafter, Borrower
     shall pay to Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) an amount
     equal to the Monthly Amortization Payment Amount, such amount to be applied
     in reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the Loans.

          (3) Maturity. On the Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay to
     Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) all outstanding principal,
     accrued and unpaid interest, and any other amounts due under the Loan
     Documents.

          (4) Optional Prepayments. Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.4(6)
     and 2.9(5), Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans in whole or in
     part on any Payment Date, without premium or penalty; provided that: (a)
     Borrower shall give Administrative Agent notice of each such prepayment as
     provided in Section 2.8(5) (and, upon the Payment Date specified in any
     such notice of prepayment, the amount to be prepaid shall become due and
     payable hereunder) and (b) partial prepayments shall be in the minimum
     aggregate principal amounts specified in Section 2.8(4). Subject to the
     provisions of Sections 2.4(6) and 2.9(5), Borrower shall have the right to
     prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to $45,000,000 if permitted under
     the terms of the Flex Letter, without premium or penalty; provided that
     Borrower shall give Administrative Agent three Business Days prior written
     notice of such prepayment (and, upon the third Business Day after
     Administrative Agent's receipt of such notice of prepayment, the amount to
     be prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder). Loans that are prepaid
     cannot be reborrowed.


                                       31
<PAGE>

          (5) Mandatory Prepayments. If a casualty or condemnation shall occur
     with respect to the Project, Borrower, upon Borrower's or Administrative
     Agent's receipt of the applicable insurance proceeds or condemnation award,
     shall prepay the Loan, if required by the provisions of Article 3, on the
     dates and in the amounts specified therein without premium (but subject to
     the provisions of Sections 2.4(6) and 2.9(5)). Nothing in this Section
     2.4(5) shall be deemed to limit any obligation of Borrower under the
     Mortgage or any other Security Document, including any obligation to remit
     to a collateral or similar account maintained by Administrative Agent
     pursuant to the Mortgage or any of the other Security Documents the
     proceeds of insurance, condemnation award or other compensation received in
     respect of any casualty or condemnation.

          (6) Interest and Other Charges on Prepayment. If the Loans are
     prepaid, in whole or in part, pursuant to Section 2.4(4), 2.4(5) or 4.4,
     each such prepayment shall be made on the prepayment date specified in the
     notice to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.8(5) (except for
     prepayments pursuant to Section 4.4, which shall be made on the date such
     amounts are applied by Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 4.4 and
     prepayments pursuant to the Flex Letter, which shall be made upon the third
     Business Day after Administrative Agent's receipt of such notice of
     prepayment) and (in every case) together with (a) the accrued and unpaid
     interest (including accrued and unpaid Additional Interest, if applicable)
     on the principal amount prepaid and (b) any amounts payable to a Lender
     pursuant to Section 2.9(5) as a result of such prepayment while an Adjusted
     LIBOR Rate is in effect; provided, however, that any such prepayment shall
     be applied first, to the prepayment of any portions of the outstanding
     principal amount that are Base Rate Loans and, second, to the prepayment of
     any portions of the outstanding principal amount that are LIBOR-based Loans
     applying such sums first to LIBOR-based Loans of the shortest maturity so
     as to minimize breakage costs; provided further, however, that if an Event
     of Default has occurred and is continuing, Administrative Agent may
     distribute such payment to the Lenders for application in such manner as it
     or the Majority Lenders, subject to Section 2.8(2), may determine to be
     appropriate).

          (7) Application of Payments. All payments received by Administrative
     Agent under the Loan Documents shall be applied: first, to any fees and
     expenses due to Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan
     Documents; second, to any Default Rate interest or late charges; third, to
     accrued and unpaid interest; and fourth, to the principal sum and other
     amounts due under the Loan Documents; provided, however, that, if an Event
     of Default has occurred and is continuing Administrative Agent shall apply
     such payments in any order or manner as Administrative Agent shall
     determine.

          (1) Deposits into Clearing Account. Borrower shall cause all rents

     the Clearing Account Agreement. Administrative Agent shall have sole
     dominion and control over the Clearing Account and Borrower shall have no
     rights to make withdrawals therefrom except as expressly set forth in the

          (2) Disbursements from Clearing Account. So long as (i) no Event of
     Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) no Low DSCR Trigger Period
     has commenced and is continuing, all available funds on deposit in the

     less often than two (2) times each calendar week) to Borrower's Operating
     Account (and Borrower agrees that deposit of the same therein shall be

     with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Cash Management
     Agreement.

          (3) Disbursements from Cash Management Account. So long as an Event of
     Default is not continuing, Administrative Agent shall direct Cash
     Management Bank to apply funds on deposit in the Cash Management Account
     (to the extent not held in Security Accounts constituting sub-accounts of
     the Cash Management Account, if any, and with the exception of Net
     Proceeds, which shall be applied as provided in Section 3.2 of this
     Agreement) on each Payment Date as follows:

          Payment Date as described in Section 4.1(1) hereof, which amount shall
          be deposited in the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account;

          deposited in the Ground Rent Reserve Account on the applicable Payment
          Date as described in Section 4.2(1) hereof, which amount shall be
          deposited in the Ground Rent Reserve Account;

               (iii) third, funds sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of
          scheduled principal (if any) and interest payments under the Notes and
          any other amounts owing to Administrative Agent and Lenders under the
          Loan Documents on the applicable Payment Date, which amount shall be
          deposited in the Debt Service Account;

               (iv) fourth, to Borrower's Operating Account, amounts required
          for payment of all Operating Expenses of the Project for such month,
          in the amount for such month set forth on the annual operating budget
          previously approved by Administrative Agent (and Borrower agrees that
          deposit of the same therein shall be deemed to be receipt by
          Borrower); and

               (v) fifth, all remaining funds, to the Low DSCR Account, to be
          held as a reserve and as additional collateral for the Loans, subject
          to Section 4.4(3) hereof.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, then all amounts on deposit in the Cash Management Account
     shall be allocated as determined by Administrative Agent in Administrative
     Agent's sole and absolute discretion.

          (4) Sufficient Funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
     contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and provided no
     Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower's obligations
     with respect to the monthly payment of interest and principal (if any) and
     the deposits to be made into the Security Accounts and any other payment
     due pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be deemed
     satisfied to the extent sufficient amounts are deposited in the Cash
     Management Account and are unconditionally available to Administrative
     Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) to satisfy such obligations in accordance
     with the terms of this Agreement and the Cash Management Agreement on the
     dates each such payment is required, regardless of whether any of such
     amounts are so applied by Administrative Agent.

          (5) Insufficient Funds. The insufficiency of funds on deposit in the
     Clearing Account or the Cash Management Account (or any sub-account
     thereunder) shall not absolve Borrower of the obligation to make any
     payments as and when due pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents, and such obligations shall be separate and independent, and not
     conditioned on any event or circumstance whatsoever.

that Borrower fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Administrative Agent may distribute such payment to the Lenders for
application in such manner as it may determine to be appropriate, subject to
Section 2.8(2) and any other agreement among Administrative Agent and the
Lenders with respect to such application).

     (c) Forwarding of Payments by Administrative Agent. Except as otherwise
agreed by Administrative Agent and the Lenders, each payment received by
Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Lender
shall be paid by Administrative Agent promptly to such Lender, in immediately
available funds, for account of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office for the
Loan or other obligation in respect of which such payment is made.

<PAGE>

     (d) Extensions to Next Business Day. If the due date of any payment under
this Agreement or any Note would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business
Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and
interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such
extension.

          (2) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
     herein: (a) each advance of a Loan from the Lenders under Section 2.1(1)
     shall be made from the Lenders, and any termination of the obligation to
     make an advance of the Loans shall be applied to the respective Commitments
     of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective
     Commitments; (b) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.9(4), Loans
     shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of
     their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Loans) or their
     respective Loans (in the case of Conversions or Continuations of Loans);
     (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by Borrower shall be
     made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective
     unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and (d) each payment of
     interest on Loans by Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro
     rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and
     payable to the respective Lenders.

          (3) Computations. Interest on all Loans shall be computed on the basis
     of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including the first day but
     excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which payable.

          (4) Minimum Amounts. Except for (a) mandatory prepayments made
     pursuant to Section 2.4(5) and (b) Conversions or prepayments made pursuant
     to Section 2.9(4), each borrowing, Conversion, Continuation and partial
     prepayment of principal (collectively, "Loan Transactions") of Loans (a)
     shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $1,000,000, (b) in the
     case of any partial prepayment, if in excess of $1,000,000, shall be in
     whole multiples of $1,000,000, and (c) in the case of borrowings of,
     Conversions into, or Continuations of, LIBOR-based Loans, if in excess of
     $1,000,000, shall be in whole multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (Loan
     Transactions of or into Loans of different Types or Interest Periods at the
     same time hereunder shall be deemed separate Loan Transactions for purposes
     of the foregoing, one for each Type or Interest Period); provided that if
     any Loans or borrowings would otherwise be in a lesser principal amount for
     any period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans during such period.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum amount of $1,000,000 shall not
     apply to Conversions of lesser amounts into a tranche of Loans that has (or
     will have upon such Conversion) an aggregate principal amount exceeding
     such minimum amount and one Interest Period.

          (5) Certain Notices. Notices by Borrower to Administrative Agent
     regarding Loan Transactions and the selection of Types of Loans and/or of
     the duration of Interest Periods shall be irrevocable and shall be
     effective only if received by Administrative Agent not later than 12:00
     noon, New York City time, on the number of Business Days prior to the date
     of the proposed Loan Transaction or the first day of such Interest Period
     specified below:

     changes in duration of Interest Period for,
     LIBOR-based Loans (subject to Section 2.4(6)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each such notice of a Loan Transaction shall specify the amount (subject to
Section 2.8(4)), Type, and Interest Period of such proposed Loan Transaction,
and the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such proposed Loan Transaction.
Notices for Conversions and Continuations shall be in the form of Exhibit E.
Each such notice specifying the duration of an Interest Period shall specify the
portion of the Loans to which such Interest Period is to relate. Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of the contents of each such notice. If
Borrower fails to select (i) the Type of Loan or (ii) the duration of any
Interest Period for any LIBOR-based Loan within the time period (i.e., three (3)
Business Days prior to the first day of the next applicable Interest Period) and
otherwise as provided in this Section 2.8(5), such Loan (if outstanding as a
LIBOR Loan) will be automatically Continued as an LIBOR-based Loan with an
Interest Period of one (1) month on the last day of the current Interest Period
for such Loan (based on a LIBOR-based Rate determined two (2) Business Days
prior to the first day of the next Interest Period) or, if outstanding as an
Base Rate Loan, will remain as a Base Rate Loan.

          (6) Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative Agent. Unless
     Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or Borrower (in
     either case, the "Payor") prior to the date on which the Payor is to make
     payment to Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Lender) the proceeds
     of a Loan to be made by such Lender hereunder or (in the case of Borrower)
     a payment to Administrative Agent for account of any Lender hereunder (in
     either case, such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"),
     which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not
     intend to make the Required Payment to Administrative Agent, Administrative
     Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in
     reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the
     amount thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on such date; and, if
     the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to Administrative
     Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay to
     Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest
     thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date
     (the "Advance Date") such amount was so made available by Administrative
     Agent until the date Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate
     per annum equal to (a) the Federal Funds Rate for such day in the case of


                                       40
<PAGE>

     payments returned to Administrative Agent by any of the Lenders or (b) the
     applicable interest rate due hereunder with respect to payments returned by
     Borrower to Administrative Agent and, if such recipient(s) shall fail
     promptly to make such payment, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
     recover such amount, on demand, from the Payor, together with interest as
     aforesaid; provided that if neither the recipient(s) nor the Payor shall
     return the Required Payment to Administrative Agent within three (3)
     Business Days of the Advance Date, then, retroactively to the Advance Date,
     the Payor and the recipient(s) shall each be obligated to pay interest on
     the Required Payment as follows:

     (a) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment to be made by
Borrower to the Lenders, Borrower and the recipient(s) shall each be obligated
retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required
Payment at the Default Rate (without duplication of the obligation of Borrower
under Section 2.3 to pay interest on the Required Payment at the Default Rate),
it being understood that the return by the recipient(s) of the Required Payment
to Administrative Agent shall not limit such obligation of Borrower under
Section 2.3 to pay interest at the Default Rate in respect of the Required
Payment, and

     (b) if the Required Payment shall represent proceeds of a Loan to be made
by the Lenders to Borrower, the Payor and Borrower shall each be obligated
retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required
Payment pursuant to whichever of the rates specified in Section 2.3 is
applicable to the Type of such Loan, it being understood that the return by
Borrower of the Required Payment to Administrative Agent shall not limit any
claim Borrower may have against the Payor in respect of such Required Payment.

          (7) Sharing of Payments, Etc.

     (a) Right of Set off. Borrower agrees that, in addition to (and without
limitation of) any right of set off, banker's lien or counterclaim a Lender may
otherwise have, (subject, as among the Lenders, to Section 12.26), each Lender
shall be entitled, at its option (to the fullest extent permitted by law), to
set off and apply any deposit (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final), or other indebtedness, held by it for the credit or account of
Borrower at any of its offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, against any
principal of or interest on any of such Lender's Loans or any other amount
payable to such Lender hereunder, that is not paid when due (regardless of
whether such deposit or other indebtedness is then due to Borrower), in which
case it shall promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent thereof,
provided that such Lender's failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity thereof.

     (b) Sharing. If any Lender shall obtain from Borrower payment of any
principal of or interest on any Loan owing to it or payment of any other amount
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document through the exercise (subject,
as among the Lenders, to Section 12.26) of any right of set-off, banker's lien
or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise (other than from Administrative
Agent as provided herein), and, as a result of such payment, such Lender shall
have received a greater percentage of the principal of or interest on the Loans
or such other amounts then due hereunder or thereunder by Borrower to such
Lender than the percentage received by any other Lender, it shall promptly
purchase from such other Lenders participations in (or, if and to the extent
specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans or such other amounts,
respectively, owing to such other Lenders (or in interest due thereon, as the
case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time


                                       41
<PAGE>

as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders shall share the benefit
of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may be incurred by such Lender
in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the
unpaid principal of and/or interest on the Loans or such other amounts,
respectively, owing to each of the Lenders. To such end all the Lenders shall
make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations
sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.

     (c) Consent by Borrower. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such
a participation (or direct interest) may exercise (subject, as among the
Lenders, to Section 12.26) all rights of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or
similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were a direct holder of Loans or other amounts (as the case may be) owing to
such Lender in the amount of such participation.

     (d) Rights of Lenders; Bankruptcy. Nothing contained herein shall require
any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to
exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to
any other indebtedness or obligation of Borrower. If, under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim
in lieu of a set-off to which this Section 2.8(7) applies, such Lender shall, to
the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in
a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section
2.8(7) to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

     Section 2.9 Yield Protection; Etc.

          (1) Additional Costs.

     (a) Costs of Making or Maintaining LIBOR-based Loans. Borrower shall pay
directly to each Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may
determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs that such
Lender determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any
LIBOR-based Loans or its obligation to make any LIBOR-based Loans hereunder, or
any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder in respect of
any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in
amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any
Regulatory Change that:

          (i)  shall subject any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office for
               any of such Loans) to any tax, duty or other charge in respect of
               such Loans or its Note or changes the basis of taxation of any
               amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or its Note
               in respect of any of such Loans (excluding changes in the rate of
               tax on the overall net income of such Lender or of such
               Applicable Lending Office by the jurisdiction in which such
               Lender has its principal office or such Applicable Lending
               Office); or


                                       42
<PAGE>

          (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar
               requirements (other than the Reserve Requirement used in the
               determination of the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for any Interest Period
               for such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or other
               assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such
               Lender (including, without limitation, any of such Loans or any
               deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Rate"), or any
               commitment of such Lender (including, without limitation, the
               Commitment of such Lender hereunder); or

          (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or its Note
               (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities) or its
               Commitment.

If any Lender requests compensation from Borrower under this paragraph (a),
Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent),
suspend the obligation of such Lender thereafter to make or Continue LIBOR-based
Loans, or to Convert Loans into LIBOR-based Loans, until the Regulatory Change
giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions
of Section 2.9(4) shall be applicable), provided that such suspension shall not
affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.

     (b) Costs Attributable to Regulatory Change or Risk-Based Capital
Guidelines. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.9(1) (but without duplication), Borrower shall pay directly to each
Lender from time to time on request such amounts as such Lender may determine to
be necessary to compensate such Lender (or, without duplication, the bank
holding company of which such Lender is a subsidiary) for any costs that it
determines are attributable to the maintenance by such Lender (or any Applicable
Lending Office or such bank holding company), pursuant to any law or regulation
or any interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the force of
law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) of any
court or governmental or monetary authority (i) following any Regulatory Change
or (ii) implementing any risk based capital guideline or other requirement
(whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply
therewith would be unlawful) hereafter issued by any government or governmental
or supervisory authority implementing at the national level the Basle Accord, of
capital in respect of its Commitment or Loans (such compensation to include,
without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on
assets or equity of such Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank
holding company) to a level below that which such Lender (or any Applicable
Lending Office or such bank holding company) could have achieved but for such
law, regulation, interpretation, directive or request.

     (c) Notification and Certification. Each Lender shall notify Borrower of
any event occurring after the date hereof entitling such Lender to compensation
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.9(1) as promptly as practicable,
but in any event within sixty (60) days, after such Lender obtains actual
knowledge thereof; provided that (i) if any Lender fails to give such notice
within sixty (60) days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such
Lender shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section
2.9(1) in respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to
payment under this Section 2.9(1) for costs incurred from and after the date
forty-five (45) days prior to the date that such Lender does give such notice
and (ii) each Lender will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for
the Loans of such Lender affected by such event if such designation will avoid


                                       43
<PAGE>

the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the
sole opinion of such Lender, be disadvantageous to such Lender, except that such
Lender shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending Office
located in the United States of America. Each Lender will furnish to Borrower a
certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender
for compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.9(1).
Determinations and allocations by any Lender for purposes of this Section 2.9(1)
of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
2.9(1), or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section 2.9(1), on its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its
obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans,
and of the amounts required to compensate such Lender under this Section 2.9(1),
shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations are made
on a reasonable basis.

          (2) Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
     notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of the LIBOR Rate for
     any Interest Period for any LIBOR-based Loan:

     (a) Administrative Agent in good faith determines, which determination
shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits
referred to in the definition of LIBOR Rate are not being provided in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining
rates of interest for LIBOR-based Loans as provided herein; or

     (b) the Majority Lenders determine, which determination shall be
conclusive, and notify Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of interest
referred to in the definition of LIBOR Rate upon the basis of which the rate of
interest for LIBOR-based Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined are
not likely adequately to cover the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining
LIBOR-based Loans for such Interest Period; then Administrative Agent shall give
Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition
remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to make additional
LIBOR-based Loans, to Continue LIBOR-based Loans or to Convert Loans of any
other Type into LIBOR-based Loans, and Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of the
then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding LIBOR-based Loans, either
prepay such Loans or such Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate
Loans.

          (3) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
     in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable
     Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR-based
     Loans hereunder (and, in the sole opinion of such Lender, the designation
     of a different Applicable Lending Office would either not avoid such
     unlawfulness or would be disadvantageous to such Lender), then such Lender
     shall promptly notify Borrower thereof (with a copy to Administrative
     Agent) and such Lender's obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert
     Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR-based Loans shall be suspended until
     such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR-based Loans (in
     which case the provisions of Section 2.9(4) shall be applicable).


                                       44
<PAGE>

          (4) Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of any Lender to
     make LIBOR-based Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into,
     LIBOR-based Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 2.9(1) or 2.9(3),
     such Lender's Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans
     on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for Loans (or, in
     the case of a Conversion resulting from a circumstance described in Section
     2.9(3), on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to Borrower with a
     copy to Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives
     notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 2.9(1)
     or 2.9(3) that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

     (a) to the extent that such Lender's Loans have been so Converted, all
payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such
Lender's Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

     (b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as
LIBOR-based Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all
Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR-based Loans
shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to Borrower with a copy to Administrative Agent that
the circumstances specified in Section 2.9(1) or 2.9(3) that gave rise to the
Conversion of such Lender's Loans pursuant to this Section 2.9(4) no longer
exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing
to exist) at a time when LIBOR-based Loans made by other Lenders are
outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on
the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
LIBOR-based Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto,
all Base Rate Loans and LIBOR-based Loans are allocated among the Lenders
ratably (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with
their respective Commitments.

          (5) Compensation. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for
     account of each Lender, upon the request of such Lender through
     Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
     reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or
     expense that such Lender determines is attributable to:

     (a) any payment, prepayment or Conversion of a LIBOR-based Loan made by
such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration of
the Loans pursuant to Administrative Agent's or the Lenders' rights referred to
in Article 11) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Loan; or

     (b) any failure by Borrower for any reason to borrow a LIBOR-based Loan
from such Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice
of borrowing given to Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall
include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid,


                                       45
<PAGE>

Converted or not borrowed for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the
Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified
for such borrowing) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided
for herein over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on
such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest component of the
amount such Lender would have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar
deposits of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and
with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such
Lender), or if such Lender shall cease to make such bids, the equivalent rate,
as reasonably determined by such Lender, derived from Page 3750 of the Dow Jones
Markets (Telerate) Service or other publicly available source as described in
the definition of LIBOR Rate.

          (6) U.S. Taxes.

     (a) Gross-up for Deduction or Withholding of U.S. Taxes. Borrower agrees to
pay to each Lender that is not a U.S. Person such additional amounts as are
necessary in order that the net payment of any amount due to such non-U.S.
Person hereunder after deduction for or withholding in respect of any U.S. Taxes
imposed with respect to such payment (or in lieu thereof, payment of such U.S.
Taxes by such non-U.S. Person), will not be less than the amount stated herein
to be then due and payable, provided that the foregoing obligation to pay such
additional amounts shall not apply:

          (i)  to any payment to any Lender hereunder unless such Lender is, on
               the date hereof (or on the date it becomes a Lender hereunder as
               provided in Section 12.24(2)) and on the date of any change in
               the Applicable Lending Office of such Lender, either entitled to
               submit a Form W-8BEN (relating to such Lender and entitling it to
               a complete exemption from withholding on all interest to be
               received by it hereunder in respect of the Loans) or Form W-8ECI
               (relating to all interest to be received by such Lender hereunder
               in respect of the Loans), or

          (ii) to any U.S. Taxes imposed solely by reason of the failure by such
               non-U.S. Person to comply with applicable certification,
               information, documentation or other reporting requirements
               concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connections
               with the United States of America of such non U.S. Person if such
               compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United
               States of America as a precondition to relief or exemption from
               such U.S. Taxes.

For the purposes hereof, (A) "U.S. Person" means a citizen, national or resident
of the United States of America, a corporation, limited liability company,
partnership or other entity created or organized in or under any laws of the

subject to Federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income, (B)
"U.S. Taxes" means any present or future tax, assessment or other charge or levy


                                       46

imposed by or on behalf of the United States of America or any taxing authority
thereof or therein, (C) "Form W-8BEN" means Form W-8BEN of the Department of the
Treasury of the United States of America and (D) "Form W-8ECI" means Form W-8ECI
of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America. Each of the
Forms referred to in the foregoing clauses (C) and (D) shall include such
successor and related forms as may from time to time be adopted by the relevant
taxing authorities of the United States of America to document a claim to which
such Form relates.

     (b) Evidence of Deduction, Etc. Within thirty (30) days after paying any
amount to Administrative Agent or any Lender from which it is required by law to
make any deduction or withholding, and within thirty (30) days after it is
required by law to remit such deduction or withholding to any relevant taxing or
other authority, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent for delivery to
such non-U.S. Person evidence satisfactory to such Person of such deduction,
withholding or payment (as the case may be).

          (7) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation
     pursuant to Section 2.9(1) or 2.9(6), or any Lender's obligation to
     Continue Loans of any Type, or to Convert Loans of any Type into the other
     Type of Loan, shall be suspended pursuant to Section 2.9(2) or 2.9(3) (any
     such Lender requesting such compensation, or whose obligations are so
     suspended, being herein called a "Requesting Lender"), Borrower, upon three
     (3) Business Days notice, may require that such Requesting Lender transfer
     all of its right, title and interest under this Agreement and such
     Requesting Lender's Note to any bank or other financial institution (a
     "Proposed Lender") identified by Borrower that is reasonably satisfactory
     to Administrative Agent (i) if such Proposed Lender agrees to assume all of
     the obligations of such Requesting Lender hereunder, and to purchase all of
     such Requesting Lender's Loans hereunder for consideration equal to the
     aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Requesting Lender's Loans,
     together with interest thereon to the date of such purchase (to the extent
     not paid by Borrower), and satisfactory arrangements are made for payment
     to such Requesting Lender of all other amounts accrued and payable
     hereunder to such Requesting Lender as of the date of such transfer
     (including any fees accrued hereunder and any amounts that would be payable
     under Section 2.9(5) as if all of such Requesting Lender's Loans were being
     prepaid in full on such date) and (ii) if such Requesting Lender has
     requested compensation pursuant to Section 2.9(1) or 2.9(6), such Proposed
     Lender's aggregate requested compensation, if any, pursuant to Section
     2.9(1) or 2.9(6) with respect to such Requesting Lender's Loans is lower
     than that of the Requesting Lender. Subject to the provisions of Section
     12.24(2), such Proposed Lender shall be a "Lender" for all purposes
     hereunder. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
     Borrower hereunder, the agreements of Borrower contained in Sections
     2.9(1), 2.9(6) and 12.5 (without duplication of any payments made to such
     Requesting Lender by Borrower or the Proposed Lender) shall survive for the
     benefit of such Requesting Lender under this Section 2.9(7) with respect to
     the time prior to such replacement.

                      INSURANCE, CONDEMNATION, AND IMPOUNDS

     Section 3.1 Insurance.

          (1) Borrower shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be maintained,
     Policies for Borrower and the Project providing at least the following
     coverages:

     (a) comprehensive all risk insurance, including but not limited to
windstorm, on the improvements and the personal property, in each case (A) in an
amount equal to 100% of the "Full Replacement Cost," which for purposes of this
Agreement shall mean actual replacement value (exclusive of costs of
excavations, foundations, underground utilities and footings) with a waiver of
depreciation, (B) containing an agreed amount endorsement with respect to the
improvements and personal property waiving all coinsurance provisions; (C)
providing for no deductible in excess of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS
($25,000), with the exception of wind, earthquake and flood which may carry a
deductible no greater than 5% of the total insurable value of the Project; and
(D) providing law and ordinance coverage, including loss to the undamaged
portion of the building, demolition and debris removal costs and increased cost
of construction if any of the Improvements or the use of the Project shall at
any time constitute legal non-conforming structures or uses in amounts as
required by Administrative Agent. In the event that coverage is no longer
carried on a blanket basis exceeding the Project's Full Replacement Cost, then
the Full Replacement Cost shall be redetermined from time to time (but not more
frequently than once in any twelve (12) calendar months) at the request of
Administrative Agent by an appraiser or contractor designated and paid by
Borrower and approved by Administrative Agent, or by an engineer or appraiser in
the regular employ of the insurer. After the first appraisal, additional
appraisals may be based on construction cost indices customarily employed in the
trade. No omission on the part of Administrative Agent to request any such
ascertainment shall relieve Borrower of any of its obligations under this
Subsection;

     (b) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal
injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring upon, in or about the
Project, such insurance (A) to be on an "occurrence" form with a combined single
limit of not less than ONE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($1,000,000) per
occurrence and TWO MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($2,000,000) general aggregate
(with a "per location" aggregate if on a blanket policy); (B) to continue at not
less than the aforesaid limit until required to be changed by Administrative
Agent in writing by reason of changed economic conditions making such protection
inadequate and to be without any deductible or self-insured retention unless
otherwise agreed to by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion; and (C) to
cover at least the following hazards: (1) premises and operations; (2) products
and completed operations on an "if any" basis; (3) independent contractors; (4)
blanket contractual liability for all "insured contracts" as defined in the
standard general liability policy; and (5) contractual liability covering the
indemnities contained in Sections 5.4, 11.3 and 14.5 hereof, to the extent the
same is available and falls within the definition of "insured contracts",
subject to the normal exclusions and restrictions of a standard Commercial
General Liability policy;


                                       48
<PAGE>

     (c) business income/loss of rents insurance (A) with loss payable to
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders); (B) covering all risks
required to be covered by the insurance provided for in Section 3.1(1)(a), (d),
(f), (g) and (h) hereof; (C) in an amount equal to (or, in the case of blanket
insurance, exceeding) 100% of the projected gross income from the Project (on an
actual loss sustained basis) for a period continuing until the Restoration of
the Project is completed; the amount of such business income/loss of rents
insurance shall be determined prior to the date hereof and at least once each
year thereafter based on Borrower's reasonable estimate of the gross income from
the Project for the succeeding twenty-four (24) month period and (D) containing
an extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides that after the
physical loss to the improvements and the personal property has been repaired,
the continued loss of income will be insured until such income either returns to
the same level it was at prior to the loss, or the expiration of twelve (12)
months from the date that the Project is repaired or replaced and operations are
resumed, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding that the policy may expire
prior to the end of such period. All insurance proceeds payable to
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders) pursuant to this Section
3.1(1)(c) shall be held by Administrative Agent and shall be applied to the
obligations secured hereunder from time to time due and payable hereunder and
under the Notes and this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the
obligations secured hereunder on the respective dates of payment provided for in
the Notes and this Agreement except to the extent such amounts are actually paid
out of the proceeds of such business income/loss of rents insurance;

     (d) at all times during which structural construction, repairs or
alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements and only if the
property and liability coverage forms do not otherwise apply (A) owner's
contingent or protective liability insurance covering claims not covered by or
under the terms or provisions of the insurance provided for in Section
3.1(1)(b), (j) and (k); and (B) the insurance provided for in Section 3.1(1)(a)
shall be written in a so called builder's risk completed value form or
equivalent coverage, including coverage for 100% of the total costs of
construction (1) on a non reporting basis, (2) against Terrorism and all risks
insured against pursuant to Section 3.1(1)(a), (c), (f), (g) and (h), (3) shall
include permission to occupy the Project, and (4) shall contain an agreed amount
endorsement waiving coinsurance provisions;

     (e) workers' compensation and employers liability in the amount of ONE
MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($1,000,000), subject to the statutory limits of the
state in which the Project is located (if applicable);

     (f) comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if applicable, in an
amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the replacement costs of the
equipment and the area surrounding the equipment or as shall be reasonably
required by Administrative Agent on terms consistent with the commercial
property insurance policy required under Section 3.1(1)(a);


                                       49

     (g) if any portion of the improvements is at any time located in an area
identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or any successor
thereto as an area having special flood hazards pursuant to the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 or the National
Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each may be amended, or any successor law
(the "Flood Insurance Acts"), flood hazard insurance of the following types and
in the following amounts (A) coverage under Policies issued pursuant to the
Flood Insurance Acts (the "Flood Insurance Policies") in an amount equal to the
maximum limit of coverage available for the Project under the Flood Insurance
Acts plus (B) coverage under supplemental private Policies in an amount, which
when added to the coverage provided under the Flood Act Policies with respect to
the Project, is not less than the original principal balance of the Notes or
such lower amount as Administrative Agent may require at its sole discretion;

     (h) if required by Administrative Agent, earthquake insurance in amounts
and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent,
provided that the insurance pursuant to this Section 3.1(1)(h) hereof shall be
on terms consistent with the all risk insurance policy required under Section
3.1(1)(a) hereof, with the exception of the deductible which shall be no greater
than 5% of the total insurable value of the Project;

     (i) crime coverage in an amount not less than Two Million and No/100
Dollars to ($2,000,000) protect against employee dishonesty and related

     (l) so-called "dramshop" or other liability insurance required in
connection with the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages in amounts as
required by Lender (if applicable);

     (m) such other insurance and in such amounts as Administrative Agent from
time to time may request, and as such other insurance becomes available in the
insurance market, against such other insurable hazards which at the time are
required to be insured against by prudent lenders for property similar to the
Project located in or around the region in which the Project is located.

In addition to, and without limiting the foregoing requirements, Borrower shall
maintain all insurance policies required under the Ground Lease.

          (2) All insurance provided for in Section 3.1(1) hereof shall be
     obtained under valid and enforceable policies (the "Policies" or in the
     singular, the "Policy"), in such forms and, from time to time after the
     date hereof, in such amounts as may be reasonably satisfactory to
     Administrative Agent, issued by financially sound and responsible insurance
     companies permitted to do business in the state in which the Project is
     located and reasonably approved by Administrative Agent. The Policies must


                                       50
<PAGE>

     be issued by either (A) an insurance company having, at all times relevant
     hereto, a claims paying ability/financial strength rating of "A" (or its
     equivalent) or better by at least two (2) Rating Agencies (one of which
     must be S&P), or (B) a syndicate of insurers through which (1) at least
     sixty percent (60%) of claims coverage shall be with one or more carriers
     having, at all times relevant hereto, a claims paying ability/financial
     strength rating of "A" (or its equivalent) or better by at least two (2)
     Rating Agencies (one of which must be S&P), and (2) the remainder (not to
     exceed forty percent (40%)) of claims coverage shall be with one or more
     carriers having a claims paying ability/financial strength rating of "BBB"
     (or its equivalent) or better by at least two (2) Rating Agencies (one of
     which must be S&P) (each such insurer satisfying the requirements of this
     Section 3.1(2) shall be referred to below as a "Qualified Insurer"). No
     Policy shall contain an exclusion from coverage under such Policy for loss
     or damage incurred as a result of an act of terrorism or similar acts of
     sabotage, provided that Borrower may obtain separate Terrorism Insurance
     coverage subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Section
     3.1(2). Borrower will be required to maintain insurance against terrorism,
     terrorist acts or similar acts of sabotage ("Terrorism Insurance") with
     coverage amounts of not less than an amount equal to the full replacement
     cost of the improvements and the personal property plus business income
     (the "Terrorism Insurance Required Amount").

          (3) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 3.1(1)
     hereof, except for the Policy referenced in Section 3.1(1)(e), shall name
     Borrower as the Named Insured and shall name Administrative Agent (for the
     benefit of the Lenders) as additional insureds, as their respective
     interests may appear, and in the case of, but not limited to, property,
     terrorism, builder's risk (if applicable), boiler and machinery, earthquake
     and flood insurance, shall name Administrative Agent as Loss Payee and
     shall contain a so-called New York standard non-contributing mortgagee
     clause or its equivalent in favor of Administrative Agent providing that
     the loss thereunder shall be payable to Administrative Agent in accordance
     with the terms of this Agreement and shall otherwise be in form, substance
     and content reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.

          (4) All Policies provided for in Section 3.1(1) hereof shall contain
     clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

          (i)  no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower,
               or failure to comply with the provisions of any Policy which
               might otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance or any
               part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
               enforceability of the insurance insofar as Administrative Agent
               is concerned;

          (ii) the Policy shall not be materially changed (other than to
               increase the coverage provided thereby) or cancelled without at
               least 30 days' written notice to Administrative Agent and any
               other party named therein as an insured;


                                       51
<PAGE>

          (iii) each Policy shall provide that the issuers thereof shall give
               written notice to Administrative Agent if the Policy has not been
               renewed thirty (30) days prior to its expiration; and

          (iv) Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any insurance
               premiums thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

          (5) Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration dates of
     the Policies theretofore furnished to Administrative Agent, certificates of
     insurance evidencing replacement or renewal Policies accompanied by
     evidence reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent of payment of the
     premiums due thereunder (the "Insurance Premiums") shall be delivered by
     Borrower to Administrative Agent. If at any time Administrative Agent is
     not in receipt of written evidence that all insurance required hereunder is
     in full force and effect, Administrative Agent shall have the right,
     without notice to Borrower to take such action as Administrative Agent
     deems necessary to protect its interest in the Project, including, without
     limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Administrative
     Agent in its reasonable discretion deems appropriate, and all expenses
     incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with such action or in
     obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by Borrower
     to Administrative Agent upon demand and until paid shall be secured by the
     Mortgage and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

          (6) In the event of a foreclosure of any of the Mortgage, or other
     transfer of title to the Project in extinguishment in whole or in part of
     the Loans all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies
     then in force and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in
     the purchaser at such foreclosure or Administrative Agent for the benefit
     of the Lenders or other transferee in the event of such other transfer of
     title.

          (7) Borrower shall not obtain (a) any umbrella or blanket liability or
     casualty Policy unless, in each case, such Policy is approved in advance in
     writing by Administrative Agent and Lenders' interest is included therein
     as provided in this Agreement, or (b) separate insurance concurrent in form
     or contributing in the event of loss with that required in Section 3.1(1)
     to be furnished by, or which may be required to be furnished by, Borrower.
     In the event Borrower obtains separate insurance or an umbrella or a
     blanket policy, Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent of the same and
     shall cause certified copies of each Policy to be delivered as required in
     Section 3.1(5).

          (8) Borrower shall give immediate written notice of any loss in excess
     of $100,000 to the insurance carrier and to Administrative Agent. Borrower
     hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers Administrative Agent, as
     attorney in fact for Borrower coupled with an interest, to make proof of
     loss, to adjust and compromise any claim under insurance policies, to
     appear in and prosecute any action arising from such insurance policies, to
     collect and receive insurance proceeds, and to deduct therefrom
     Administrative Agent's expenses incurred in the collection of such
     proceeds. Nothing contained in this Section 3.1(8), however, shall require
     Administrative Agent or any Lender to incur any expense or take any action
     hereunder.


                                       52
<PAGE>

          (9) Administrative Agent hereby acknowledges that, based upon the
     evidence of insurance provided to Administrative Agent by Borrower prior to
     the date hereof, to the best of Administrative Agent's knowledge, Borrower
     is in compliance with the requirements of this Section 3.1 as of the
     Closing Date.

     Section 3.2 Use and Application of Net Proceeds.

     The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration of
the Project:

          (1) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than the Threshold Amount and
     the costs of completing the Restoration shall be less than Threshold

               be continuing;

          (ii) (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance Proceeds, less
               than fifty percent (50%) of the gross leasable area of the
               improvements on the Project has been damaged, destroyed or
               rendered unusable as a result of such Casualty or (2) in the
               event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less than ten
               percent (10%) of the land constituting the Project is taken, and
               such land is located along the perimeter or periphery of the
               Project;

               greater than sixty percent (60%) of the total rentable space in
               the Project which has been demised under executed and delivered
               leases in effect as of the date of the occurrence of such fire or
               other casualty or taking, whichever the case may be, shall remain
               in full force and effect during and after the completion of the
               Restoration, notwithstanding the occurrence of any such Casualty
               or Condemnation, whichever the case may be;

          (iv) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as reasonably
               practicable and shall diligently pursue the same to satisfactory
               completion in compliance with all applicable laws, including,
               without limitation, all applicable Environmental Laws;

          (v)  Administrative Agent shall be reasonably satisfied that any

               to the Project as a result of the occurrence of any such Casualty
               or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be covered out
               of (1) the Net Proceeds, (2) the insurance coverage referred to

               Borrower;

          (vi) Administrative Agent shall be reasonably satisfied that the
               Restoration will be substantially completed in accordance with

               to repair and restore the Project to the condition it was in
               immediately prior to such Casualty or Condemnation or (4) the

               Coverage Ratio after the completion of the Restoration shall be
               equal to or greater than the lesser of 1.45 to 1.00 or the Debt
               Service Coverage Ratio immediately prior to the Casualty or
               Condemnation, as applicable;

          (ix) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not result in
               the total and permanent (following the Restoration) loss of
               access to the Project or the related improvements;


                                       54

               Administrative Agent a signed detailed budget approved in writing
               by Borrower's architect or engineer stating the entire cost of
               completing the Restoration, which budget shall be reasonably
               acceptable to Administrative Agent;

          (xi) the Net Proceeds together with any cash or letter of credit
               deposited by Borrower with Administrative Agent are sufficient in
               Administrative Agent's reasonable discretion to cover the cost of
               the Restoration; and

          (xii) the Management Agreement in effect as of the date of the
               occurrence of such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case
               may be, shall (1) remain in full force and effect during the
               Restoration and shall not otherwise terminate as a result of the
               Casualty or Condemnation or the Restoration or (2) if terminated,
               shall have been replaced with a replacement Management Agreement
               with a replacement Manager approved by Administrative Agent,
               prior to the opening or reopening of the Project or any portion
               thereof for business with the public.

     (b) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Administrative Agent in an interest
bearing account (with interest to be available to Borrower to the same extent as
Net Proceeds are made available pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.2) and,
until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2, shall
constitute additional security for the Loans and other obligations under the
Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be disbursed by Administrative Agent to,
or as directed by, Borrower from time to time during the course of the
Restoration, upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
Agent that (A) all materials installed and work and labor performed (except to
the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested disbursement) in
connection with the Restoration have been paid for in full (less Casualty
Retainage), (B) all conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2(2)(a) have
been satisfied, and (C) there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders,
mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of intention to file same, or any
other Liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever on the Project which have
not either been fully bonded to the reasonable satisfaction of Administrative
Agent and discharged of record or in the alternative fully insured to the
reasonable satisfaction of Administrative Agent by the title company issuing the
title insurance policy.

     (c) All plans and specifications required in connection with the
Restoration, the cost of which is greater than the Threshold Amount, shall be
subject to prior review and acceptance (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in all material respects by Administrative
Agent and by an independent consulting engineer (the "Casualty Consultant")
selected by Administrative Agent and approved by Borrower, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Administrative Agent shall
have the use of the plans and specifications and all permits, licenses and
approvals required or obtained in connection with the Restoration. The identity
of the contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration
the cost of which is greater than the Threshold Amount, as well as the contracts


                                       55
<PAGE>

under which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review and
acceptance by Administrative Agent and the Casualty Consultant, such acceptance
not to be unreasonably withheld. All costs and expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent in connection with making the Net Proceeds available for
the Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
disbursements and the Casualty Consultant's fees, shall be paid by Borrower.

     (d) In no event shall Administrative Agent be obligated to make
disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs
actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the
Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the Casualty
Retainage. The term "Casualty Retainage" shall mean an amount equal to (i) ten
percent (10%) of the first fifty percent (50%) of the costs actually incurred
for work in place as part of the Restoration, and (ii) five percent (5%) of the
remainder of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the
Restoration, in each case as certified by the Restoration Consultant, until the
Restoration has been completed. The Casualty Retainage shall in no event, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section 3.2(2),
be less than the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors,
subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration (but shall not be
duplicative of such amounts actually held back by Borrower). The Casualty
Retainage shall not be released until the Casualty Consultant certifies to
Administrative Agent that the Restoration has been completed (subject to
punchlist items and non-material items of work) in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 3.2 and that all approvals necessary for the
re-occupancy and use of the Project have been obtained from all appropriate
Governmental Authorities, and Administrative Agent receives evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent that the costs of the Restoration have been
paid in full or will be paid in full out of the Casualty Retainage; provided,
however, that Administrative Agent will release the portion of the Casualty
Retainage being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or
materialman engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon which the Casualty
Consultant certifies to Administrative Agent that the contractor, subcontractor
or materialman has satisfactorily completed all work and has supplied all
materials in accordance with the provisions of the contractor's, subcontractor's
or materialman's contract, the contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers
the lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the
contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested by
Administrative Agent or by the title company issuing the title insurance policy
for the Project, and receives an endorsement to such title insurance policy
insuring the continued priority of the Lien of the Mortgage and evidence of
payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. The release of any such
portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if
any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the
contractor, subcontractor or materialman, if and to the extent such approval is
required by the terms of the applicable payment or performance bond.

     (e) Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make disbursements of
the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

     (f) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance thereof
shall not, in the opinion of Administrative Agent in consultation with the
Casualty Consultant, if any, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the
costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in
connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit the
deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency"), either in cash or a letter of
credit, with Administrative Agent before any further disbursement of the Net
Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with


                                       56
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall be held by Administrative Agent in the
Casualty/Taking Account in accordance with the Cash Management Agreement and
shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the
Restoration on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net
Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof shall constitute
additional security for the Loans and other obligations under the Loan
Documents.

     (g) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining balance, if
any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Administrative Agent after
the Casualty Consultant certifies to Administrative Agent that the Restoration
has been completed in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2, hereof and
the receipt by Administrative Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent that all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration
have been paid in full, shall be remitted by Administrative Agent to Borrower,
provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing.

          (3) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
     Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds
     pursuant to Section 3.2(2)(g) hereof may be retained and applied by
     Administrative Agent toward the payment of the Loans (without any
     prepayment premium) whether or not then due and payable in the manner
     provided in Section 2.4(6) (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, in such order, proportion and priority as Administrative Agent
     may determine in its sole and absolute discretion) or, at the sole and
     absolute discretion of Administrative Agent, the same may be paid, either
     in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes as Administrative Agent
     shall approve, in its sole and absolute discretion. If Administrative Agent
     shall receive and retain Net Proceeds, the Lien of the Mortgage shall be
     reduced only by the amount thereof received and retained by Administrative
     Agent and actually applied by Administrative Agent in reduction of the
     Loans.

     Section 3.3 Casualty and Condemnation.

     (a) If the Project shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by
fire or other casualty (a "Casualty"), Borrower shall give prompt notice of such
damage to Administrative Agent and shall promptly commence and diligently
prosecute the completion of the Restoration of the Project as nearly as possible
to the condition the Project was in immediately prior to such Casualty, with
such alterations as may be reasonably approved by Administrative Agent and
otherwise in accordance with Section 3.2 hereof. Borrower shall pay all costs of
such Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance (provided
that, if Net Proceeds are required to be made available to Borrower for
Restoration pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2 hereof, they are made available
to Borrower for Restoration). Administrative Agent may, but shall not be
obligated to, make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.

     (b) Borrower shall promptly give Administrative Agent notice of the actual
commencement (or threat in writing) of any proceeding for the Condemnation of
all or any part of the Project and shall deliver to Administrative Agent copies
of any and all papers served in connection with such proceedings (or received
relating to such threatened proceedings). Administrative Agent may participate


                                       57
<PAGE>

in any such proceedings, and Borrower shall, from time to time, deliver to
Administrative Agent all instruments reasonably requested by it to permit such
participation. Borrower shall, at its expense, diligently prosecute any such
proceedings, and shall consult with Administrative Agent, its attorneys and
experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or defense of any such
proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or quasi public authority
through Condemnation or otherwise (including, but not limited to, any transfer
made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of such taking), Borrower
shall continue to pay the Loans at the time and in the manner provided for its
payment in the Notes and in this Agreement and the Loans shall not be reduced
until any Award shall have been actually received and applied by Administrative
Agent, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the reduction or
discharge of the Loans. Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be
limited to the interest paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall
be entitled to receive out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided
herein or in the Notes. If the Project or any portion thereof is taken by a
condemning authority, Borrower shall, promptly commence and diligently prosecute
the Restoration of the Project and otherwise comply with the provisions of
Section 3.2 hereof. If the Project is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise,
prior to the receipt by Administrative Agent of the Award, Administrative Agent
shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the Notes shall
have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion
thereof sufficient to pay the Loans.


                                    ARTICLE 4

                     RESERVES; COLLATERAL LETTERS OF CREDIT

     Section 4.1 Real Estate Tax and Insurance Reserve Fund.

          (1) Deposits. Upon the commencement and during the continuance of a
     Low DSCR Trigger Period, on each Payment Date, Borrower shall (except to
     the extent such amounts have already been deposited in the Tax and
     Insurance Reserve Account pursuant to Section 2.7(3)(i)) deposit with
     Administrative Agent, for deposit in the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account,
     (i) a monthly amount, as determined by Administrative Agent, which will be
     sufficient to accumulate with Administrative Agent thirty (30) days prior
     to each due date therefor sufficient funds to pay all real estate taxes
     which Administrative Agent estimates will be payable during the next
     ensuing twelve (12) months, and (ii) a monthly amount, as reasonably
     determined by Administrative Agent, which will be sufficient to accumulate
     in the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account thirty (30) days prior to the
     expiration of the insurance policies which Administrative Agent estimates
     will be payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded by the insurance
     policies during the next ensuing twelve (12) months (said amounts in
     clauses (i) and (ii) above, together with any amount already on deposit in
     the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account as set forth in the first sentence of
     this Section 4.1(1), being, collectively, the "Tax and Insurance Reserve
     Fund"). If at any time Administrative Agent reasonably determines that the
     Tax and Insurance Reserve Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay real
     estate taxes and insurance premiums by the dates set forth in clauses (i)
     and (ii) above, Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of such
     determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payments to


                                       58
<PAGE>

     Administrative Agent by the amount that Administrative Agent estimates is
     sufficient to make up the deficiency thirty (30) days prior to delinquency
     of the real estate taxes and/or thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the
     insurance policies, as the case may be.

          (2) Disbursements. Borrower shall furnish Administrative Agent with
     (i) bills for the charges for which such deposits are required and (ii) a
     disbursement request (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
     Agent), executed by an authorized officer of Borrower, at least thirty (30)
     days prior to the date on which the charges become delinquent. Provided
     that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Administrative
     Agent will direct the Depository Bank to apply the Tax and Insurance
     Reserve Fund to payments of insurance premiums and real estate taxes
     required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 9.2,
     respectively, and under the Mortgage but not, in any event, earlier than
     ten (10) days prior to the due dates thereof and, in any event, only to the
     extent sufficient funds are then available in the Tax and Insurance Reserve
     Fund. In making any payment relating to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Fund,
     the Depository Bank may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate
     procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to real estate
     taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to insurance premiums), without
     inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the
     validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or
     claim thereof unless said bill, statement or estimate is obviously
     incorrect. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance Reserve Fund shall exceed
     the amounts due for real estate taxes and insurance premiums pursuant to
     Sections 3.1 and 9.2, respectively, Administrative Agent shall, in its sole
     and absolute discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such
     excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
     Fund. Provided that on the date that said real estate taxes are due and
     payable, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and sufficient
     funds are on deposit in the Tax and Insurance Reserve Fund to pay real
     estate taxes, Borrower shall not be liable to pay and shall not be charged
     with any late charges, interest and/or penalties imposed by or payable to
     any Governmental Authority as a result of the Depository Bank's failure to
     pay real estate taxes prior to the date that same become delinquent.

          (3) Release. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, any funds held in the Tax and Insurance Reserve Fund shall be
     released to Borrower upon the occurrence of a Low DSCR Release Event and,
     in such event Borrower shall no longer be required to cause any amounts to
     be deposited into the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account unless a Low DSCR
     Trigger Event occurs with respect to any future calendar quarter.

     Section 4.2 Ground Rent Reserve Account.

          (1) Deposits. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Low
     DSCR Trigger Period, on each Payment Date, Borrower shall deposit with
     Administrative Agent, for deposit in the Ground Rent Reserve Account, a


                                       59
<PAGE>

     monthly amount, as reasonably determined by Administrative Agent, which
     will be sufficient to accumulate in the Ground Rent Reserve Account thirty
     (30) days prior to the due date therefor, sufficient funds to pay all rent
     and other amounts payable by Borrower under the Ground Lease which
     Administrative Agent estimates will be payable during the next ensuing
     twelve (12) months (said amount being the "Ground Rent Reserve Fund"). If
     at any time Administrative Agent reasonably determines that the Ground Rent
     Reserve Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay all rent and other
     amounts payable by Borrower under the Ground Lease by the dates set forth
     above, Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of such determination and
     Borrower shall increase its monthly payments to Administrative Agent by the
     amount that Administrative Agent estimates is sufficient to make up the
     deficiency thirty (30) days prior to delinquency of such rent and other
     amounts payable by Borrower under the Ground Lease.

          (2) Disbursement. Borrower shall furnish Administrative Agent with (i)
     bills or other evidences reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent of
     the amounts for which such deposits are required and (ii) a disbursement
     request (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent),
     executed by an authorized officer of Borrower, at least thirty (30) days
     prior to the date on which such amounts first become due and payable under
     the Ground Lease. Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, Administrative Agent will direct the Depository Bank to apply
     the Ground Rent Reserve Fund to payments of rent and other amounts payable
     by Borrower under the Ground Lease but not, in any event, earlier than ten
     (10) days prior to the due dates thereof and, in any event, only to the
     extent sufficient funds are then available in the Ground Rent Reserve Fund.
     In making any payment relating to the Ground Rent Reserve Fund, the
     Depository Bank may do so according to any bill or other evidence of the
     amounts due as Borrower shall have provided as required above, without
     inquiry into the accuracy of such bill or other evidence. If the amount of
     the Ground Rent Reserve Fund shall exceed the amounts required to pay all
     rent and other amounts payable by Borrower under the Ground Lease,
     Administrative Agent shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, return any
     excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be made
     to the Ground Rent Reserve Fund.

          (3) Release. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, any funds held in the Ground Rent Reserve Fund shall be
     released to Borrower upon the occurrence of a Low DSCR Release Event and,
     in such event Borrower shall no longer be required to cause any amounts to
     be deposited into the Ground Rent Reserve Account unless a Low DSCR Trigger
     Event occurs with respect to any future calendar quarter.

     Section 4.3 Intentionally Omitted.

     Section 4.4 Low DSCR Reserve Fund.


                                       60
<PAGE>

          (1) Deposits. During any Low DSCR Trigger Period, Borrower shall cause
     such amounts to be deposited in the Low DSCR Account as are required to be
     deposited therein pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof and pursuant to the Cash
     Management Agreement (said amounts being, collectively, the "Low DSCR
     Reserve Fund"), which amounts shall constitute additional collateral for
     the Loans.

          (2) Cure of Low DSCR Trigger Event. Upon the occurrence of a Low DSCR
     Trigger Event, Borrower shall have the right, on or before the date which
     is ten (10) days after the date of any such determination (but in any event
     within fifty (50) days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter) to
     either (a) make a payment (a "Low DSCR Cure Prepayment") in reduction of
     the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in an amount reasonably
     determined by Administrative Agent (together with all applicable breakage
     costs or other charges, if any, provided for herein) such that after giving
     effect to such payment, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio would have been at
     least 1.45:1.00 as of the end of the applicable calendar quarter had such
     prepayment been made as of the first day of such calendar quarter; or (b)
     make a deposit of cash with Administrative Agent, and/or deliver a
     Collateral Letter of Credit to Administrative Agent as additional
     collateral for the Notes and Borrower's other obligations under the Loan
     Documents (such cash or Collateral Letter of Credit, a "Low DSCR Cure
     Delivery"), in each case, in an amount reasonably determined by
     Administrative Agent such that if the amount so deposited were used to make
     a principal prepayment, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio would have been at
     least 1.45:1.00 as of the end of the applicable calendar quarter had such
     prepayment been made as of the first day of such calendar quarter;
     provided, however, that Borrower shall only be permitted to cure a Low DSCR
     Trigger Event by delivery of a Low DSCR Cure Delivery pursuant to clause
     (b) of this Section 4.4(2) two (2) times during the term of the Loans and
     any other cure of a Low DSCR Trigger Event by Borrower pursuant to this
     Section 4.4(2) must be accomplished pursuant to clause (a) hereof. Any cash
     Low DSCR Cure Delivery and the proceeds of any Collateral Letter of Credit
     Low DSCR Cure Delivery shall be deposited by Administrative Agent in the
     Additional Cash Collateral Account as additional collateral for all
     obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to be
     applied in accordance with Section 4.8 below, and shall be subject to the
     terms of the Cash Management Agreement, including the security interest
     granted by Borrower therein pursuant to the Cash Management Agreement.

          (3) Release. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, any funds held in the Low DSCR Account delivered pursuant to
     Section 4.4(1) shall be released to Borrower upon the occurrence of a Low
     DSCR Release Event and, in such event Borrower shall no longer be required
     to cause any amounts to be deposited into the Low DSCR Account unless a Low
     DSCR Trigger Event occurs with respect to any future calendar quarter.
     Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any cash Low
     DSCR Cure Delivery and the proceeds of any Collateral Letter of Credit Low
     DSCR Cure Delivery held in the Additional Collateral Account pursuant to
     Section 4.4(2) and any undrawn Collateral Letters of Credit delivered


                                       61
<PAGE>

     pursuant to Section 4.4(2) shall be released to Borrower when the Debt
     Service Coverage Ratio, as determined as of the end of each calendar
     quarter, shall be at or above 1.45:1.00 for at least two (2) consecutive
     calendar quarters and, in such event Borrower shall no longer be required
     to cause any amounts to be deposited into the Additional Collateral Account
     pursuant to Section 4.4(2) unless a Low DSCR Trigger Event occurs with
     respect to any future calendar quarter.

          (4) Application to Obligations. If at any time a Low DSCR Trigger
     Event occurs and a Low DSCR Release Event does not occur within two (2)
     calendar quarters after such Low DSCR Trigger Event, then, Administrative
     Agent, at its option, may withdraw any amounts on deposit in the Low DSCR
     Account and apply such funds to payment of the Loans in the manner provided
     in Section 2.4(6) or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, in such order, proportion and priority as Administrative Agent
     may determine in its sole and absolute discretion. Administrative Agent's
     right to withdraw and apply such funds shall be in addition to all other
     rights and remedies provided to Administrative Agent on behalf of the
     Lenders under the Loan Documents.

     Section 4.5 Intentionally Omitted.

     Section 4.6 Required Repair Reserve Fund.

          (1) Deposits. Borrower shall perform the repairs at the Project, as
     more particularly set forth on Schedule 4.6 hereto (such repairs
     hereinafter referred to as "Required Repairs") in a good and workmanlike
     manner free and clear of all Liens whether or not the Required Repair
     Reserve Fund is sufficient to cover all of the costs required to make the
     Required Repairs. Borrower shall substantially complete the Required
     Repairs on or before the required deadline for each repair as set forth on
     Schedule 4.6, subject however to extension for force majeure. On the
     Closing Date, Borrower shall deposit $227,198 (the "Required Repair Reserve
     Fund") with Administrative Agent to perform the Required Repairs for the
     Project, which amount shall be deposited in the Required Repair Reserve
     Account.

          (2) Disbursements. Administrative Agent will cause the Depository Bank
     to transfer amounts credited to the Required Repair Reserve Fund to
     Borrower's account to pay or reimburse Borrower for the costs incurred by
     Borrower in connection with the Required Repairs from time to time on a
     monthly basis upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the following
     conditions: (i) Borrower shall submit a written request for payment to
     Administrative Agent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on
     which Borrower requests such payment be made and specifies the Required
     Repairs to be paid, (ii) on the date such request is received by
     Administrative Agent and on the date such payment is to be made, no Event
     of Default shall exist and remain uncured, (iii) Administrative Agent shall
     have received a certificate from Borrower (A) stating that all Required
     Repairs to be funded by the requested disbursement have been completed in a


                                       62
<PAGE>

     good and workmanlike manner and substantially in accordance with all
     applicable laws, such certificate to be accompanied by a copy of any
     license, permit or other approval by any Governmental Authority required to
     commence and/or complete such Required Repairs, (B) identifying each Person
     that supplied materials or labor in connection with the Required Repairs to
     be funded by the requested disbursement, and (C) stating that each such
     Person has been paid in full or will be paid in full upon such
     disbursement, such certificate to be accompanied by lien waivers or other
     evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, (iv)
     Administrative Agent shall have received such other evidence as
     Administrative Agent shall reasonably request that the Required Repairs to
     be funded by the requested disbursement have been completed and are paid
     for or will be paid upon such disbursement to Borrower, (v) Administrative
     Agent shall not be required to approve any costs for a particular Required
     Repair which exceeds the portion of the Required Repair Reserve Fund
     allocated to such Required Repair on Schedule 4.6, and (vi) Administrative
     Agent may require an inspection of the Project at Borrower's expense prior
     to making a monthly disbursement in order to verify completion of the
     Required Repair for which reimbursement is sought and, if any such
     inspection is so required, the same shall be completed with reasonable
     diligence. In addition, if required by Administrative Agent, Borrower shall
     deliver to Administrative Agent, in connection with any disbursement to pay
     or reimburse Borrower for any costs incurred under a contract that requires
     payment by Borrower of an aggregate of more than $50,000 (whether or not
     the individual payment exceeds such amount), copies of lien waivers and
     releases from the general contractor under the applicable contract in
     connection with the requested disbursement. Administrative Agent shall not
     be required to make disbursements from the Required Repair Account unless
     such requested disbursement is in an amount greater than $25,000 (or a
     lesser amount if the total amount in the Required Repair Account is less
     than $25,000, in which case only one disbursement of the amount remaining
     in the account shall be made) and such disbursement shall be made only upon
     satisfaction of each condition contained in this Section 4.6. Upon
     completion of the Required Repairs, any funds remaining on deposit in the

          (2) Borrower covenants and agrees:

     (A) to do all acts that may be reasonably necessary to maintain, preserve
and protect Reserved Account Collateral;

     (B) to pay promptly when due all material taxes, assessments, charges,
encumbrances and liens now or hereafter imposed upon or affecting any Reserved
Account Collateral;

     (C) to appear in and defend any action or proceeding which may materially
and adversely affect Borrower's title to or Administrative Agent's interest in
the Reserved Account Collateral;

     (D) following the creation of each Reserve Fund and Security Account
established by or for Borrower and the initial funding thereof, other than to
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement or the Cash Management
Agreement, not to transfer, assign, sell, surrender, encumber, mortgage,
hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of any of the Reserve Account Collateral or
rights or interests therein, and to keep the Reserve Account Collateral free of
all levies and security interests or other liens or charges except the security
interest in favor of Administrative Agent granted hereunder;

     (E) to account fully for and promptly deliver to Administrative Agent, in
the form received, all documents, chattel paper, instruments and agreements
constituting the Reserve Account Collateral hereunder, endorsed to
Administrative Agent or in blank, as requested by Administrative Agent, and
accompanied by such powers as appropriate and until so delivered all such
documents, instruments, agreements and proceeds shall be held by Borrower in
trust for Administrative Agent, separate from all other property of Borrower;
and

     (F) from time to time upon request by Administrative Agent, to furnish such
further assurances of Borrower's title with respect to the Reserve Account
Collateral, execute such written agreements, or do such other acts, all as may
be reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this agreement or as may
be required by law, or in order to perfect or continue the first-priority lien
and security interest of Administrative Agent in the Reserve Account Collateral.

          (3) Rights on Event of Default. Upon the occurrence and during the
     continuance of an Event of Default, Administrative Agent, at its option,
     may withdraw the Reserve Funds and the other funds in the Security Accounts
     and apply such funds to the items for which the Reserve Funds were
     established or to payment of the Loans in such order, proportion and
     priority as Administrative Agent may determine in its sole and absolute
     discretion. Administrative Agent's right to withdraw and apply such funds
     shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to
     Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under the Loan Documents.


                                       64
<PAGE>

          (4) Prohibition Against Further Encumbrance. Borrower shall not,
     without the prior consent of Administrative Agent, further pledge, assign
     or grant any security interest in the Reserve Funds or the Security
     Accounts or permit any Lien to attach thereto, or any levy to be made
     thereon, or any Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, except those
     naming Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders as the secured party,
     to be filed with respect thereto.

          (5) Release of Reserve Funds. Any amount remaining in the Reserve
     Funds and the Security Accounts after the Loans have been paid in full
     shall be promptly returned to Borrower.

     Section 4.8 Collateral Letters of Credit. With respect to any Collateral
Letter of Credit which Borrower may furnish or cause to be furnished to
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents:

          (1) Administrative Agent will be entitled, among other things, to make
     one or more draws by presentment thereof to the issuing bank accompanied
     only by Administrative Agent's clean sight-draft, it being intended that
     the issuing bank shall have no right to inquire as to Administrative
     Agent's right to draw upon such Collateral Letter of Credit;

          (2) Administrative Agent shall be entitled, among other things, to
     draw upon each Collateral Letter of Credit, in whole, or in part from time
     to time, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
     Default or under the other circumstances under which a draw shall be
     permitted under the Loan Documents or the Collateral Letter of Credit;

          (3) Administrative Agent shall have the right to draw upon any
     Collateral Letter of Credit within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration
     date of such Collateral Letter of Credit and each renewal and extension
     thereof unless, prior to such expiration date of such Collateral Letter of
     Credit and each renewal and extension thereof, Borrower shall have
     furnished a replacement, extension or renewal Collateral Letter of Credit,
     acceptable to Administrative Agent, it being the intent hereof that at no
     time shall the unexpired term of any Collateral Letter of Credit be less
     than thirty (30) days. If Administrative Agent draws upon a Collateral
     Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms of this subsection (3), then
     Administrative Agent shall hold the proceeds thereof in the Additional Cash
     Collateral Account as additional collateral for all obligations under this
     Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to be applied in accordance with
     subsections (4) and (5) below.

          (4) Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to draw upon a
     Collateral Letter of Credit if Administrative Agent believes that its
     rights to draw on such Collateral Letter of Credit could be in jeopardy.


                                       65
<PAGE>

     Without limiting the foregoing, Administrative Agent shall also be entitled
     to draw on a Collateral Letter of Credit if the credit rating or financial
     condition of the issuing bank is no longer meets the minimum rating
     contained in the definition of Collateral Letter of Credit. Following a
     draw by Administrative Agent on a Collateral Letter of Credit solely
     because of the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuing bank,
     Administrative Agent will deposit such proceeds in the Additional Cash
     Collateral Account as security for the purposes for which such Letter of
     Credit was delivered and Administrative Agent shall be entitled to draw
     upon such proceeds to the same extent it would have been entitled to make a
     draw under the applicable Letter of Credit. Administrative Agent shall
     direct the Depository Bank to disburse such proceeds to Borrower provided
     (i) Borrower delivers to Administrative Agent a replacement Collateral
     Letter of Credit within ten (10) days of Administrative Agent's draw, (ii)
     there exists no Event of Default or Potential Default, and (iii) Borrower
     pays all of Administrative Agent's fees and expenses in connection with
     such draw and disbursement.

          (5) No draw by Administrative Agent on any Collateral Letter of Credit
     shall cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default or limit in any
     respect any of Administrative Agent's or the Lenders' remedies under the
     Loan Documents, it being understood that Administrative Agent's and the
     Lenders' rights and remedies hereunder shall be cumulative and
     Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have no obligations to apply the
     proceeds of any draw to missed installments or other amounts then due and
     unpaid under the Loans. Proceeds of any draw upon a Collateral Letter of
     Credit (after reimbursement of any costs and expenses, including attorneys'
     fees and reimbursements, incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
     with such draw) may be applied by Administrative Agent to the payment of
     the Loans in such manner as Administrative Agent may determine. No delay or
     omission of Administrative Agent or the Lenders in exercising any right to
     draw on a Collateral Letter of Credit shall impair any such right, or shall
     be construed as a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any Event of Default.

          (6) Administrative Agent shall, upon request, release its rights in
     any Collateral Letters of Credit and surrender such Collateral Letters of
     Credit to the issuing bank upon the payment in full of all Loans.

notwithstanding the repayment of the Loans or any transfer or sale of any right,
title and interest in the Project (by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure
or otherwise).

to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement,
operating agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a
party or by which any of Borrower's property or assets is subject, nor will such
action result in any violation of the provisions of any statute or any order,

marketable and insurable fee title to the Project (other than the Ground Lease
Property), free and clear of all Liens whatsoever, except for the Permitted

party that Borrower has defaulted on any obligation to pay for work, labor or
materials affecting the Project which are or may become a Lien prior to, or of
equal priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents. To Borrower's
knowledge, none of the Permitted Encumbrances, individually or in the aggregate,
materially interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided
by the Mortgage and this Agreement, materially and adversely affect the value of
the Project, impair the use or operations of the Project or impair Borrower's
ability to pay its obligations in a timely manner.

whether latent or otherwise, and Borrower has not received written notice from
any insurance company or bonding company of any defects or inadequacies in the
Project, or any part thereof, which would adversely affect the insurability of
the same or cause the imposition of extraordinary premiums or charges thereon or
of any termination or threatened termination of any policy of insurance or bond.

     in, the Project or any part thereof, whether voluntarily or involuntarily
     (b) sell, transfer, convey, alienate, mortgage, pledge, encumber, grant a

defer, any real estate taxes and assessments, franchise taxes and charges, and
other governmental charges that may become a Lien upon the Project or become

including interest and penalties, (3) Borrower is diligently contesting the same
by appropriate legal proceedings in good faith and at its own expense and
concludes such contest prior to the tenth (10th) day preceding the earlier to
occur of the Maturity Date or the date on which the Project is scheduled to be
sold for non-payment, (4) such proceedings shall not subject Borrower,
Administrative Agent or any Lender to either civil or criminal liability; and
(5) Borrower, upon final determination, shall pay the amount of such claims,
demands and Taxes together with all interest and penalties thereon and all cost
relating thereto.

     Section 9.3 Control; Management.

     Administrative Agent. Borrower shall not terminate, replace or appoint any
     manager or terminate or amend the Management Agreement for the Project
     without Administrative Agent's prior written approval. Any change in
     ownership or control of the Manager shall be cause for Administrative Agent
     to re-approve such Manager and Management Agreement. If at any time
     Administrative Agent consents to the appointment of a new manager, such new
     manager and Borrower shall, as a condition of Administrative Agent's
     consent, execute a Manager's Consent and Subordination of Management
     Agreement in the form then used by Administrative Agent. Each manager shall
     hold and maintain all necessary licenses, certifications and permits
     required by law. Borrower shall fully perform all of its covenants,
     agreements and obligations under the Management Agreement.

          (2) Borrower shall: (i) diligently perform and observe all of the
     terms, covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement on the part of
     the Borrower to be performed and observed so that the rights of the
     Borrower under the Management Agreement remain unimpaired; and (ii)
     promptly notify Administrative Agent of the giving of any notice by the
     Manager to Borrower of any default by Borrower in the performance or
     observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Management
     Agreement on the part of Borrower and deliver to Administrative Agent a
     true copy of each such notice. Borrower shall promptly enforce the
     performance and observance of all of the covenants required to be observed
     and performed by the Manager.

          (3) If (i) at any time, an Event of Default occurs and is continuing,
     (ii) Manager shall become bankrupt or insolvent or the subject of any
     bankruptcy proceeding or (iii) a default by Manager occurs under the

     Borrower shall, at the request of Administrative Agent) terminate the
     Management Agreement and replace Manager with an independent third-party
     manager approved by Administrative Agent on terms and conditions reasonably
     satisfactory to Administrative Agent.

     Section 9.5 Taxes on Security. Borrower shall pay all taxes, charges,
filing, registration and recording fees, excises and levies payable with respect
to the Notes or the Liens created or secured by the Loan Documents, other than
income, franchise and doing business taxes imposed on Administrative Agent or
any Lender. If there shall be enacted any law (1) deducting the Loans from the
value of the Project for the purpose of taxation, (2) affecting any Lien on the
Project, or (3) changing existing laws of taxation of mortgages, deeds of trust,
security deeds, or debts secured by real property, or changing the manner of
collecting any such taxes, Borrower shall promptly pay to Administrative Agent,
on demand, all taxes, costs and charges for which Administrative Agent or any
Lender is or may be liable as a result thereof; however, if such payment would
be prohibited by law or would render the Loans usurious, then instead of
collecting such payment, Administrative Agent may (and on the request of the
Majority Lenders shall) declare all amounts owing under the Loan Documents to be
immediately due and payable.

     Section 9.6 Legal Existence; Name, Etc. Borrower shall preserve and keep in
full force and effect its existence as a Single Purpose Entity, entity status,

     Section 9.7 Affiliate Transactions. Without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent, Borrower shall not engage in any transaction with an
Affiliate of Borrower except in the ordinary course of its business and on terms
which are intrinsically fair and are no less favorable to it than would be
obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction with an unrelated third party.

     Section 9.8 Limitation on Other Debt. Borrower shall not, without the prior
written consent of Administrative Agent and the Majority Lenders, incur any Debt
other than (a) the Loans, (b) obligations under any Hedge Agreement entered into

connection therewith.

defenses exist against the Loans and, if any are alleged to exist, the nature
thereof in detail, and such other matters as Administrative Agent reasonably may
request.

     Section 9.11 Notice of Certain Events. Borrower shall promptly notify
Administrative Agent of (1) any Event of Default, together with a detailed
statement of the steps being taken to cure such Event of Default; (2) any notice
of default received by Borrower or any Borrower Party under other obligations
relating to the Project or otherwise material to Borrower's business; and (3)
any threatened or pending legal, judicial or regulatory proceedings, including
any dispute between Borrower and any Governmental Authority, affecting Borrower
or the Project.

     Section 9.12 Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold
Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever,
including the reasonable fees and actual expenses of their counsel, which may be
imposed upon, asserted against or incurred by any of them relating to or arising
out of (1) the Project or (2) any of the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, (a) any accident, injury to

<PAGE>

a Lien, and (e) any brokerage commissions or finder's fees claimed by any broker
or other party in connection with the Loans, the Project, or any of the
transactions contemplated in the Loan Documents, including those arising from
the joint, concurrent, or comparative negligence of Administrative Agent or any
Lender, except to the extent any of the foregoing is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused
by Administrative Agent's or any Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, in which case the party to whom the gross negligence or willful
misconduct is attributable (but not any other party) shall not be entitled to
the indemnification provided for hereunder to the extent of such gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

     Section 9.13 Payment for Labor and Materials. Borrower will promptly pay
when due all bills and costs for labor, materials, and specifically fabricated
materials incurred in connection with the Project and never permit to exist
beyond the due date thereof in respect of the Project or any part thereof any

of a casualty in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

     Section 9.15 Hedge Agreements.

          (1) Borrower will (A) within ten (10) days after the Closing Date,
     enter into, and shall at all times thereafter maintain in full force and
     effect, a Hedge Agreement in the notional amount equal to $45,000,000, and
     (B) within ten (10) days after the date that Eurohypo has syndicated the
     Loans to the extent that the remaining principal amount of the Loans held
     by Eurohypo is not greater than $45,000,000, enter into, and shall at all
     times thereafter maintain in full force and effect, a Hedge Agreement in
     (or increase the existing Hedge Agreement by) the notional amount equal to
     $45,000,000 (for a total of $90,000,000), in each case (under the foregoing
     clauses (A) and (B)) reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent with
     (i) a Eurohypo Counterparty or (ii) one or more other banks or insurance
     companies (each a "Third-Party Counterparty"), that shall have the effect
     of capping the LIBOR rate at five percent (5%) per annum through the
     Maturity Date. The Hedge Agreement shall require monthly fixed rate and
     floating rate payments and be based on a LIBOR Rate of interest having
     successive Interest Periods (an "Interest Rate Hedge Period") of one month
     or such other Interest Periods reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
     Agent. Prior to entering into any Third-Party Hedge Agreement, Borrower


                                       86
<PAGE>

     shall notify Eurohypo in writing of its intention to enter into such
     Third-Party Hedge Agreement, which notice shall include a description of
     the terms and conditions upon which Borrower is willing to enter into same
     and, in such event, Eurohypo shall have a right of first refusal to enter
     into (or cause another Eurohypo Counterparty to enter into) a Hedge
     Agreement with Borrower on the same terms and otherwise on such terms and
     conditions as the parties thereto shall agree.

          (2) All of Borrower's obligations under any Hedge Agreement provided
     by a Eurohypo Counterparty shall be secured by the lien of the Mortgage on
     a pari passu basis with the Loans and other sums evidenced or secured by
     the Loan Documents. Borrower's rights under or in respect of any Hedge
     Agreement shall be assigned to Administrative Agent pursuant to a Hedge
     Agreement Pledge.

          (3) Any Hedge Agreement with Third-Party Counterparties is herein
     called a "Third-Party Hedge Agreement". With respect to each Third-Party
     Hedge Agreement (i) Borrower's obligations thereunder shall not be secured
     by the Mortgage and shall not be secured by any Lien on or in all or any
     portion of the collateral under the Security Documents or on or in any
     direct or indirect interest in Borrower; (ii) the Third-Party Counterparty
     providing such Third-Party Hedge Agreement must have a long term credit
     rating no lower than "AA" from S&P at the time of entry into such
     Third-Party Hedge Agreement; (iii) the form and substance must be
     reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent; (iv) such Third-Party
     Hedge Agreement shall provide pursuant to its terms that it may not be
     terminated for any reason other than upon the repayment in full of all of
     the obligations under the Loan Documents or upon acceleration of the Loans,
     and (v) the Third-Party Counterparty providing such Third-Party Hedge
     Agreement must enter into a written agreement with Administrative Agent
     providing Administrative Agent with the ability to cure any Borrower
     defaults under the Third-Party Hedge Agreement and to maintain the
     Third-Party Hedge Agreement in full force and effect after the occurrence
     of any Borrower default or other Borrower caused termination event
     thereunder caused by Borrower, which agreement must be in form and
     substance acceptable to Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion
     and in all respects and shall in no event obligate Administrative Agent to
     perform any of Borrower's obligations thereunder.

          (4) In the event of any downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
     rating of the a Third-Party Counterparty below "AA" by S&P Borrower shall
     replace the Hedge Agreement with a replacement Hedge Agreement meeting the
     requirements of this Section 9.15 not later than fifteen (15) Business Days
     after learning of such downgrade, withdrawal or qualification.

          (5) If Borrower fails for any reason or cause whatsoever to secure a
     Hedge Agreement as and when required to do so hereunder, such failure shall
     constitute an Event of Default and Administrative Agent shall be entitled
     to exercise all rights and remedies available to it under this Agreement
     and the other Loan Documents or otherwise, including the right (but not the
     obligation) of Administrative Agent to secure or otherwise enter into one


                                       87
<PAGE>

     or more Hedge Agreements with a Lender for and on behalf of Borrower
     without such action constituting a cure of such Event of Default and
     without waiving Administrative Agent's or Lenders' rights arising out of or
     in connection with such Event of Default. If Administrative Agent shall
     enter into a Hedge Agreement with a Lender in accordance with its right to
     do so pursuant to this subsection (5), then (i) the terms and provisions of
     any such Hedge Agreement, including the term thereof, shall be reasonably
     determined by Administrative Agent and (ii) Borrower shall pay all of
     Administrative Agent's costs and expenses in connection therewith,
     including any fees charged by the applicable counterparty, attorneys' fees
     and disbursements, and the cost of additional title insurance in an amount
     determined by Administrative Agent to be necessary to protect
     Administrative Agent and the Lenders from potential funding losses under
     any Hedge Agreement provided by Administrative Agent.

          (6) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, provide
     Administrative Agent with such additional title insurance coverage and
     endorsements to the title policy (or, if such additional title insurance is
     not available by endorsement, Borrower shall provide separate title
     insurance policies with respect thereto) as Administrative Agent shall
     reasonably require in connection with any Hedge Agreement provided by
     Administrative Agent under subsection (5) of this Section 9.15.

          (7) If Borrower is entitled to receive a payment under any Hedge
     Agreement upon a termination thereof, such payment shall be delivered to
     Administrative Agent and applied by Administrative Agent to any amounts due
     to Administrative Agent or the Lenders under the Loan Documents in such
     order and priority as Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole and
     absolute discretion.

          (8) The economic and other benefits of the Hedge Agreements secured by
     Borrower and all of the other rights of Borrower thereunder shall be
     collaterally assigned to Administrative Agent as additional security for
     the Loans, pursuant to a Hedge Agreement Pledge. All Hedge Agreement
     Pledges shall be accompanied by (i) Uniform Commercial Code financing
     statements, in duplicate, with respect to such pledges and (ii) the consent
     and agreement of the counterparty thereunder that it will continue to
     perform its obligations under such Hedge Agreement for the benefit of
     Administrative Agent and the Lenders after enforcement of and/or
     realization on such Hedge Agreement Pledge and an acknowledgement that
     Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have assumed any of the
     obligations or duties of Borrower under any such Hedge Agreement.

          (9) In connection with a Third-Party Hedge Agreement, Borrower shall
     obtain and deliver to Administrative Agent an opinion from counsel (which
     counsel may be in-house counsel for the Third-Party Counterparty) for the
     Third-Party Counterparty (in form reasonably satisfactory to Administrative
     Agent and upon which Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective
     successors and assigns may rely) which shall provide, in relevant part,
     that:


                                       88
<PAGE>

     (a) the Third-Party Counterparty is duly organized, validly existing, and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and has the organizational power and authority to execute and
deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Third-Party Hedge Agreement;

     (b) the execution and delivery of the Third-Party Hedge Agreement by the
Third-Party Counterparty, and any other agreement which the Third-Party
Counterparty has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of
its obligations thereunder have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary
action and do not contravene any provision of its certificate of incorporation
or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) or any law, regulation or
contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or its property;

     (c) all consents, authorizations and approvals required for the execution
and delivery by the Third-Party Counterparty of the Third-Party Hedge Agreement,
and any other agreement which the Third-Party Counterparty has executed and
delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations thereunder
have been obtained and remain in full force and effect, all conditions thereof
have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing
with any Governmental Authority or regulatory body is required for such
execution, delivery or performance; and

     (d) the Third-Party Hedge Agreement, and any other agreement which the
Third-Party Counterparty has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, has been
duly executed and delivered by the Third-Party Counterparty and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Third-Party Counterparty, enforceable
against the Third-Party Counterparty in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

If any Hedge Agreement delivered by Borrower to Administrative Agent, shall by
its terms, expire prior to the Maturity Date, Borrower shall deliver to
Administrative Agent a replacement Hedge Agreement at least ten (10) Business

          (2) Notwithstanding any provisions set forth herein or in any other
     document regarding Administrative Agent's approval of alterations of the

     altered) in any manner which would materially increase Borrower's
     responsibilities for compliance with the applicable Access Laws without the
     prior written approval of Administrative Agent. The foregoing shall apply
     to tenant improvements (a) constructed by Borrower or (b) constructed by
     any tenants with the knowledge of Borrower. Administrative Agent may

     acceptable to Administrative Agent.

          (3) Borrower agrees to give prompt notice to Administrative Agent of
     the receipt by Borrower of any written complaints related to violation of

zoning, land use or other purposes, without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall Borrower take any
action that would reduce or impair either (a) the number of parking spaces at

nonexempt prohibited transaction (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could subject Administrative Agent and/or the
Lenders, on account of any Loan or execution of the Loan Documents hereunder, to
any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

     Section 9.20 Books and Records; Inspection Rights. Borrower will, and will
cause each of the other Borrower Parties to, keep proper books of record and
account in which full, true and correct entries are made of all dealings and
transactions in relation to its business and activities. Borrower will, and will
cause each of the other Borrower Parties to, permit any representatives
designated by Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon reasonable prior notice,
to visit and inspect its properties, to examine and make extracts from its books
and records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its
officers and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often
as reasonably requested; provided that any such inspection shall not materially
interfere with the use and operation of the Project.

     Section 9.21 Foreign Assets Control Regulations. Neither Borrower nor any
Borrower Party shall use the proceeds of the Loan in any manner that will
violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets
control regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle
B, Chapter V, as amended) or the Anti-Terrorism Order or any enabling
legislation or executive order relating to any of the same. Without limiting the
foregoing, neither Borrower nor any Borrower Party will permit itself nor any of
its Subsidiaries to (a) become a blocked person described in Section 1 of the
Anti-Terrorism Order or (b) knowingly engage in any dealings or transactions or
be otherwise associated with any person who is known by such Borrower Party or
who (after such inquiry as may be required by applicable law) should be known by
such Borrower Party to be a blocked person.

     Section 9.22 Litigation Naming Administrative Agent or a Lender. If any
litigation, administrative proceeding, investigation or other legal action shall
be commenced against Borrower, any Borrower Party or any tenant at the Project,
or that otherwise relates in any way to any such party or the Project or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, in any such case, Administrative Agent or
any Lender is named as a party thereto, Borrower shall, within three (3) days of
written demand by Administrative Agent, provide Administrative Agent and/or any
such Lender with a Collateral Letter of Credit or bond satisfactory to
Administrative Agent and any such Lender in its or their sole discretion to
protect such party from any potential costs or liabilities relating thereto, all
in form and substance acceptable to each such party in its sole discretion;
provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to so protect any such
party from any such costs or liabilities to the extent such costs or liabilities
have resulted solely from Administrative Agent's or any Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct, in which case the party to whom the gross
negligence or willful misconduct is attributable (but not any other party) shall
not be entitled to the protection to be provided for under such Collateral
Letter of Credit or bond to the extent of such gross negligence or willful
misconduct; and provided further, however, that if the applicable litigation,
administrative proceeding, investigation or other legal action shall have been
commenced by Administrative Agent or any Lender, then, the Administrative Agent
or such Lender which shall have commenced the same (but not any other party)
shall not be entitled to the protection to be provided for under such Collateral
Letter of Credit or bond.

     Section 9.23 Ground Lease Covenants. With respect to the Ground Lease,
Borrower agrees as follows:


                                       91
<PAGE>

          (1) Borrower shall perform all obligations of the tenant under the
     Ground Lease and under any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation relating
     to the Ground Lease, and shall not to cause or permit any breach thereof,
     and shall use diligent efforts in good faith to enforce the obligations of
     the landlord under the Ground Lease to the end that Borrower may enjoy all
     the rights granted under the Ground Lease. If Borrower shall default under
     the Ground Lease, or if Administrative Agent shall receive notice of any
     default under the Ground Lease, Administrative Agent may, at its option but
     without any obligation to do so, take any action necessary or desirable to
     cure any such default, Administrative Agent being authorized to enter upon
     the Ground Lease Property and the remainder of the Project for such purpose
     with or without notice and without becoming a mortgagee in possession.
     Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent all costs of Administrative
     Agent incurred in curing any such default, together with interest on such
     costs from the date of expenditure until said sums have been paid, at the
     Default Rate.

          (2) Borrower shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business
     Days after the same is received or sent by Borrower) deliver to
     Administrative Agent copies of any written notice of default under the
     Ground Lease that is received, or sent, by Borrower.

          (3) Borrower acknowledges and agrees that there shall, without the
     written consent of Administrative Agent, be no merger of the Ground Lease
     nor of the leasehold estate or other estate created thereby, with the fee
     estate in the Ground Lease Property by reason of the fact that the Ground
     Lease, or the leasehold estate or other estate created thereby, may be held
     directly or indirectly by or for the account of any person or entity who or
     which also holds the fee or leasehold estate in such property (including,
     without limitation, by virtue of the exercise by Borrower of any right to
     purchase all or any portion of the Ground Lease Property or the exercise by
     the landlord under the Ground Lease of any right to require Borrower to
     purchase all or any portion of the Ground Lease Property, which purchase by
     the Borrower, in either such case, shall be subject to the restrictions
     contained in this Agreement).

          (4) Borrower acknowledges and agrees that no termination or surrender
     by Borrower under the Ground Lease to the landlord thereunder shall be
     valid or effective. The terms of the Ground Lease may not be modified,
     amended, supplemented, waived or released, or terminated or subordinated to
     any mortgage, agreement, lease or other interest, either orally or in
     writing, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent.

          (5) Borrower acknowledges and agrees that if the Ground Lease is for
     any reason whatsoever terminated prior to the expiration of its term and,
     if pursuant to any provision of the Ground Lease or otherwise,
     Administrative Agent or its designee shall acquire from the landlord under
     the Ground Lease a new lease or other agreement for the use of the property
     covered by the Ground Lease, Borrower shall not have any right, title or
     interest in or to such new lease or other agreement or the estate created
     thereby.


                                       92
<PAGE>

          (6) Without obtaining Administrative Agent's prior written consent,
     Borrower shall not acquire the fee title to the Ground Lease Property or
     make any election, give any consent or approval or invoke any right of
     first refusal, purchase option, put or call right as a tenant under the
     Ground Lease.

          (7) Borrower shall from time to time upon the written request of
     Administrative Agent request from the landlord under the Ground Lease, and
     use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Administrative Agent,
     estoppel certificates from the landlord under the Ground Lease, in form and
     substance reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.

          (8) Borrower acknowledges that pursuant to Section 365 of the
     Bankruptcy Code it is possible that a trustee in bankruptcy of the landlord
     under the Ground Lease, or such landlord as a debtor-in-possession, could
     reject the Ground Lease, in which case the Borrower, as tenant, would have
     the election described in Section 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code (which
     election, as the same may be amended from time to time, and together with
     any comparable right under any other state or federal law relating to
     bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief for debtors, whether now or
     hereafter in effect, is herein called the "Election") to treat the Ground
     Lease as terminated by such rejection or, in the alternative, to remain in
     possession for the balance of the term of the Ground Lease, and any renewal
     or extension thereof that is enforceable by the tenant under applicable
     nonbankruptcy law. Borrower shall not permit the termination of the Ground
     Lease by exercise of the Election or otherwise without the prior written
     consent of Administrative Agent, which consent may be withheld, conditioned
     or delayed for any reason in Administrative Agent's sole and absolute
     discretion. In order to secure the covenant made in this subsection and as
     security for the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents, Borrower
     assigns the Election and all rights related thereto to Administrative Agent
     (for the benefit of Lenders). Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the
     foregoing assignment of the Election and related rights is one of the
     rights which Administrative Agent may use at any time in order to protect
     and preserve the other rights and interests of Administrative Agent and
     Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, since exercise
     of the Election in favor of terminating the Ground Lease without
     Administrative Agent's consent would constitute waste hereunder. Borrower
     agrees that exercise of the Election in favor of preserving the right to
     possession under the Ground Lease shall not be deemed to constitute a
     taking or sale of the Ground Lease Property by Administrative Agent and
     shall not entitle Borrower to any credit against the Loans or other
     obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Borrower
     acknowledges and agrees that in the event the Election is exercised in
     favor of the Borrower remaining in possession, Borrower's resulting rights
     under the Ground Lease, as adjusted by the effect of Section 365 of the
     Bankruptcy Code, shall then be subject to this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents.


                                       93
<PAGE>

          (9) If there shall be filed by or against Borrower a petition under
     the Bankruptcy Code, and the Borrower, as the tenant under the Ground
     Lease, shall determine to reject the Ground Lease pursuant to Section
     365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, then Borrower shall give Administrative
     Agent not less than ten (10) days' prior notice of the date on which the
     Borrower shall apply to the bankruptcy court for authority to reject the
     Ground Lease. Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not the
     obligation, to serve upon Borrower within such 10-day period a notice
     stating that (i) Administrative Agent demands that the Borrower assume and
     assign the Ground Lease to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 365 of
     the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) Administrative Agent agrees to cure or provide
     adequate assurance of prompt cure of all defaults and provide adequate
     assurance of future performance under the Ground Lease. If Administrative
     Agent serves upon Borrower the notice described in the preceding sentence,
     Borrower shall not seek to reject the Ground Lease and shall comply with
     the demand provided for in clause (i) of the preceding sentence within
     thirty (30) days after the notice shall have been given, subject to the
     performance by Administrative Agent of the agreement provided for in clause
     (ii) of the preceding sentence.

          (10) Effective upon the entry of an order for relief in respect of the
     Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code, the Borrower hereby assigns and
     transfers to Administrative Agent a non-exclusive right to apply to the
     bankruptcy court under Section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code for an
     order extending the period during which the Ground Lease may be rejected or
     assumed.


                                   ARTICLE 10

                                    REMEDIES

     Section 11.1 Remedies - Insolvency Events. Upon the occurrence of any Event
of Default described in Section 10.8 or 10.9, the obligations of the Lenders to
advance amounts hereunder shall immediately terminate, and all amounts due under
the Loan Documents immediately shall become due and payable, all without written


                                       97
<PAGE>

notice and without presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest or dishonor,
notice of intent to accelerate the maturity thereof, notice of acceleration of
the maturity thereof, or any other notice of default of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by Borrower; provided, however, if the Bankruptcy
Party under Section 10.8 or 10.9 is other than Borrower, then all amounts due
under the Loan Documents shall become immediately due and payable at
Administrative Agent's election, in Administrative Agent's sole and absolute
discretion.

     Section 11.2 Remedies - Other Events. Except as set forth in Section 11.1
above, while any Event of Default exists and is continuing, Administrative Agent
may (1) by written notice to Borrower, declare the entire amount of the Loans to
be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest, notice of
protest or dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate the maturity thereof, notice
of acceleration of the maturity thereof, or other notice of default of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower, (2) terminate the
obligation, if any, of the Lenders to advance amounts hereunder, and (3)
exercise all rights and remedies therefor under the Loan Documents and at law or
in equity.

     Section 11.3 Administrative Agent's Right to Perform the Obligations. If
Borrower shall fail, refuse or neglect to make any payment or perform any act
required by the Loan Documents, then while any Event of Default exists and is
continuing, and without notice to or demand upon Borrower and without waiving or
releasing any other right, remedy or recourse Administrative Agent or any Lender
may have because of such Event of Default, Administrative Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) make such payment or perform such act for the account of
and at the expense of Borrower, and shall have the right to enter upon the
Project for such purpose and to take all such action thereon and with respect to
the Project as it may deem necessary or appropriate. If Administrative Agent
shall elect to pay any sum due with reference to the Project, Administrative
Agent may do so in reliance on any bill, statement or assessment procured from
the appropriate Governmental Authority or other issuer thereof without inquiring
into the accuracy or validity thereof. Similarly, in making any payments to
protect the security intended to be created by the Loan Documents,
Administrative Agent shall not be bound to inquire into the validity of any
apparent or threatened adverse title, Lien, encumbrance, claim or charge before
making an advance for the purpose of preventing or removing the same.
Additionally, if any Hazardous Materials affect or threaten to affect the
Project, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) give such
notices and take such actions as it deems necessary or advisable in order to
abate the discharge of any Hazardous Materials or remove the Hazardous
Materials. Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold Administrative Agent and
the Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and disbursements, incurred or accruing by reason of any acts performed by
Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Section
11.3, including those arising from the joint, concurrent, or comparative
negligence of Administrative Agent and any Lender, except to the extent that
they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from Administrative Agent's or any Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct, in which case the party to whom the gross
negligence or willful misconduct is attributable (but not any other party) shall
not be entitled to the indemnification provided for hereunder to the extent of
such gross negligence or willful misconduct. All sums paid by Administrative


                                       98
<PAGE>

Agent pursuant to this Section 11.3, and all other sums expended by
Administrative Agent or any Lender to which it shall be entitled to be
indemnified, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of
such payment or expenditure until paid, shall constitute additions to the Loans,
shall be secured by the Loan Documents and shall be paid by Borrower to
Administrative Agent upon demand.

least ten (10) days' prior written notice of such change of address.

     Section 12.2 Amendments, Waivers, Etc.

          (1) Subject to any consents required pursuant to this Section 12.2 and
     any other provisions of this Agreement and any other Loan Document which
     expressly require the consent, approval or authorization of the Majority
     Lenders, this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be modified or
     supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed by Borrower and
     Administrative Agent; provided that, Administrative Agent may (without any
     Lender's consent) give or withhold its agreement to any amendments of the
     Loan Documents or any waivers or consents in respect thereof or exercise or
     refrain from exercising any other rights or remedies which Administrative
     Agent may have under the Loan Documents or otherwise provided that such
     actions do not, in Administrative Agent's judgment reasonably exercised,
     materially adversely affect the value of any collateral, taken as a whole,
     or represent a departure from Administrative Agent's standard of care
     described in Section 14.5 (and the assignment or granting of a
     participation by Eurohypo shall not limit or otherwise affect its


                                       99
<PAGE>

     discretion in respect of any of the foregoing), except that Administrative
     Agent will not, without the consent of each Lender, agree to the following
     (provided that no Lender's consent shall be required for any of the
     following which are otherwise required or contemplated under the Loan
     Documents): (a) reduce the principal amount of the Loans or reduce the
     interest rate thereon; (b) extend any stated payment date for principal of
     or interest on the Loans payable to such Lender; (c) release Borrower, any
     Guarantor or any other party from liability under the Loan Documents
     (except for any assigning Lender pursuant to Section 12.24 and any
     resigning Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 14.8); (d) release or
     subordinate in whole or in part any material portion of the collateral
     given as security for the Loans; (e) modify any of the provisions of this
     Section 12.2, the definition of "Majority Lenders" or any other provision
     in the Loan Documents specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
     required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
     determination or grant any consent thereunder; (f) modify the terms of any
     Event of Default; or (g) consent to (i) the sale, transfer or encumbrance
     of any portion of the Project (or any interest therein) or any direct or
     indirect ownership interest therein and (ii) the incurrence by Borrower of
     any additional indebtedness secured by the Project, in each case to the
     extent (and subject to any standard of reasonability) such consent is
     required under the Loan Documents.

          (2) Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Agreement,
     any modification or supplement of Article 14, or of any of the rights or
     duties of Administrative Agent hereunder, shall require the consent of
     Administrative Agent.

     Section 12.3 Limitation on Interest. It is the intention of the parties
hereto to conform strictly to applicable usury laws. Accordingly, all agreements
between Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the Loans
are hereby expressly limited so that in no event, whether by reason of
acceleration of maturity or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be
paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender or charged by any Lender for the use,
forbearance or detention of the money to be lent hereunder or otherwise, exceed
the maximum amount allowed by law. If the Loans would be usurious under
applicable law (including the laws of the state in which the Project is located
and the laws of the United States of America), then, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the Loan Documents: (1) the aggregate of all consideration which
constitutes interest under applicable law that is contracted for, taken,
reserved, charged or received under the Loan Documents shall under no
circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law,
and any excess shall be credited on the Notes by the holders thereof (or, if the
Notes have been paid in full, refunded to Borrower); and (2) if maturity is
accelerated by reason of an election by Administrative Agent in accordance with
the terms hereof, or in the event of any prepayment, then any consideration
which constitutes interest may never include more than the maximum amount
allowed by applicable law. In such case, excess interest, if any, provided for
in the Loan Documents or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread from the date of advance
until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is uniform through the
term hereof. If such amortization, proration, allocation and spreading is not
permitted under applicable law, then such excess interest shall be cancelled
automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if


                                      100
<PAGE>

theretofore paid, shall be credited on the Notes (or, if the Notes have been
paid in full, refunded to Borrower). The terms and provisions of this Section
12.3 shall control and supersede every other provision of the Loan Documents.
Except as otherwise set forth herein or therein, the Loan Documents are
contracts made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by
the laws of the State of New York, except that if at any time the laws of the
United States of America permit the Lenders to contract for, take, reserve,
charge or receive a higher rate of interest than is allowed by the laws of the
State of New York or the laws of any other applicable state (whether such
federal laws directly so provide or refer to the law of any state), then such
federal laws shall to such extent govern as to the rate of interest which the
Lenders may contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive under the Loan
Documents.

     Section 12.4 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of any Loan Document is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully
severable; the Loan Documents shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part thereof;
the remaining provisions thereof shall remain in full effect and shall not be
affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance
therefrom; and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there
shall be added automatically as a part of such Loan Document a provision as
similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
possible to be legal, valid and enforceable.

     Section 12.5 Reimbursement of Expenses. Borrower shall pay or reimburse
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders on demand of the applicable party for:
(1) all expenses incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the Loans,
including reasonable fees and expenses of Administrative Agent's attorneys,
environmental, engineering, appraisal, surveying and other consultants, and
fees, charges or taxes for the negotiation, recording or filing of Loan
Documents, (2) all expenses, whether internal or external, of Administrative
Agent in connection with the administration of the Loans (including, without
limitation, in connection with any Potential Default, Event of Default or any
requested or proposed modification, waiver or consent hereunder or under any of
the other Loan Documents), including audit costs, inspection fees, attorneys'
fees and disbursement, settlement of condemnation and casualty awards, and
premiums for title insurance and endorsements thereto, (3) all of Administrative
Agent's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of Administrative Agent's external counsel) incurred in connection
with the syndication of the Loans to the Lenders, (4) all of Administrative
Agent's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of Administrative Agent's external counsel) incurred in connection
with any Bifurcation of the Loans, and (5) all amounts expended, advanced or
incurred by Administrative Agent and the Lenders to collect the Notes, or to
enforce the rights of Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, or to defend or assert the rights and claims of
Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or with respect to
the Project (by litigation or other proceedings), which amounts will include all
court costs, attorneys' fees and expenses, fees of auditors and accountants, and
investigation expenses as may be incurred by Administrative Agent and the
Lenders in connection with any such matters (whether or not litigation is
instituted), together with interest at the Default Rate on each such amount from
the date of disbursement until the date of reimbursement to Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, all of which shall constitute part of the Loans and shall be
secured by the Loan Documents.

     Section 12.6 Approvals; Third Parties; Conditions. All approval rights
retained or exercised by Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to
leases, contracts, plans, studies and other matters are solely to facilitate the
Lenders' credit underwriting, and shall not be deemed or construed as a
determination that the Lenders have passed on the adequacy thereof for any other
purpose and may not be relied upon by Borrower or any other Person. This
Agreement is for the sole and exclusive use of Administrative Agent, the Lenders
and Borrower and may not be enforced, nor relied upon, by any Person other than
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Borrower. All conditions of the
obligations of Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including the
obligation to make advances, are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit
of Administrative Agent and the Lenders, their successors and assigns, and no
other Person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions or
be entitled to assume that the Lenders will refuse to make advances in the
absence of strict compliance with any or all of such conditions, and no other
Person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of such
conditions, any and all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part by
Administrative Agent and the Lenders at any time in their sole and absolute
discretion.

     Section 12.7 Lenders and Administrative Agent Not in Control; No
Partnership. None of the covenants or other provisions contained in this
Agreement shall, or shall be deemed to, give Administrative Agent or any Lender
the right or power to exercise control over the affairs or management of
Borrower, the power of Administrative Agent and the Lenders being limited to the
rights to exercise the remedies referred to in the Loan Documents. The
relationship between Borrower and the Lenders is, and at all times shall remain,
solely that of debtor and creditor. No covenant or provision of the Loan
Documents is intended, nor shall it be deemed or construed, to create a
partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income
between Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Borrower or to create an equity in
the Project in Administrative Agent or any Lender. Administrative Agent and the
Lenders neither undertake nor assume any responsibility or duty to Borrower or
to any other person with respect to the Project or the Loans, except as
expressly provided in the Loan Documents; and notwithstanding any other
provision of the Loan Documents: (1) neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender
is, nor shall be construed as, a partner, joint venturer, alter ego, manager,
controlling person or other business associate or participant of any kind of
Borrower or its stockholders, members, or partners and neither Administrative
Agent nor any Lender intends to ever assume such status; (2) no Lender or
Administrative Agent shall in any event be liable for any Debts, expenses or
losses incurred or sustained by Borrower; and (3) no Lender or Administrative
Agent shall be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts, omissions or
decisions of Borrower or its stockholders, members, or partners. Administrative
Agent, the Lenders and Borrower disclaim any intention to create any
partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income
between Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Borrower, or to create an equity
in the Project in Administrative Agent or any Lender, or any sharing of
liabilities, losses, costs or expenses.

     Section 12.8 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to
this Agreement.

     Section 12.9 Successors and Assigns. Subject to the provisions of Section
12.24, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Borrower and the respective successors and
permitted assigns.

     Section 12.10 Renewal, Extension or Rearrangement. All provisions of the
Loan Documents shall apply with equal effect to each and all promissory notes
and amendments thereof hereinafter executed which in whole or in part represent
a renewal, extension, increase or rearrangement of the Loans. For portfolio
management purposes, the Lenders may elect to divide the Loans into two or more
separate loans evidenced by separate promissory notes so long as the payment and
other obligations of Borrower are not effectively increased or otherwise
modified. Borrower agrees to cooperate with Administrative Agent and the Lenders
and to execute such documents as Administrative Agent reasonably may request to
effect such division of the Loans.

     Section 12.11 Waivers. No course of dealing on the part of Administrative
Agent or any Lender, their officers, employees, consultants or agents, nor any

exercising any right, power or privilege of Administrative Agent or any Lender
under any of the Loan Documents, shall operate as a waiver thereof.

     Section 12.12 Cumulative Rights. Rights and remedies of Administrative
Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents shall be cumulative, and the
exercise or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other right or remedy.

other Loan Documents in the singular, where the context so permits, shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa. The definitions of words in the
singular in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall apply to such
words when used in the plural where the context so permits and vice versa.

     Section 12.14 Phrases. When used in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, the phrase "including" shall mean "including, but not limited to,"

be, in all respects, the phrases "with Lender's consent", "with Lender's
approval", "with Administrative Agent's consent" or "with Administrative Agent's

discretion, and the phrases "acceptable to Lender" or "acceptable to
Administrative Agent" shall mean acceptable to Lender or Administrative Agent,
as the case may be, at such party's sole and absolute discretion."

     Section 12.15 Exhibits and Schedules. The exhibits and schedules attached
to this Agreement are incorporated herein and shall be considered a part of this
Agreement for the purposes stated herein.

     Section 12.16 Titles of Articles, Sections and Subsections. All titles or

case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,

releases, advertisements and other promotional materials in connection with
Administrative Agent's or such Lender's own promotional and marketing
activities, and describing the Loans in general terms or in detail and
Administrative Agent's or such Lender's participation in the Loans. All
references to Administrative Agent or any Lender contained in any press release,
advertisement or promotional material issued by Borrower shall be approved in
writing by Administrative Agent and such Lender in advance of issuance.

     Section 12.18 Survival. All of the representations, warranties, covenants,
and indemnities of Borrower hereunder (including environmental matters under
Article 5, the obligations under Sections 2.9(1), 2.9(5) and 2.9(6)), and under
the indemnification provisions of the other Loan Documents shall survive (a) the
repayment in full of the Loans and the release of the Liens evidencing or
securing the Loans, (b) the transfer (by sale, foreclosure, conveyance in lieu
of foreclosure or otherwise) of any or all right, title and interest in and to
the Project to any party, whether or not an Affiliate of Borrower and (c) in the
case of any Lender that may assign any interest in its Commitment or Loans

     Section 12.19 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BORROWER, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH
LENDER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE
OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENT (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTION
OF EITHER PARTY OR ANY EXERCISE BY ANY PARTY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS UNDER
THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THE LOANS OR THE PROJECT
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT,
AND ANY CLAIM OR DEFENSE ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY INDUCED
OR IS OTHERWISE VOID OR VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT.

     Section 12.20 Remedies of Borrower. It is expressly understood and agreed
that, notwithstanding any applicable law or any provision of this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents to the contrary, the liability of Administrative Agent
and each Lender (including their respective successors and assigns) and any
recourse of Borrower against Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be
limited solely and exclusively to their respective interests in the Loans and/or
Commitments or the Project. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that a
claim or adjudication is made that Administrative Agent, any of the Lenders, or
their agents, acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case
where by Applicable Law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any such agent, as the case may be, has an
obligation to act reasonably or promptly, or otherwise violated this Agreement
or the Loan Documents, Borrower agrees that none of Administrative Agent, the
Lenders or their agents shall be liable for any incidental, indirect, special,
punitive, consequential or speculative damages or losses resulting from such
failure to act reasonably or promptly in accordance with this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents.

between such parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
Accordingly, the Loan Documents may not be contradicted by evidence of prior,

exists between the Commitment Letter and this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

     Section 12.23 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which shall

     all of the Lenders and Administrative Agent.

          (2) Assignments by the Lenders. Each Lender may assign any of its
     Loans, its Note and its Commitment (but only with the consent of
     Administrative Agent); provided that:

     (a) no such consent by Administrative Agent shall be required in the case
of any assignment by any Lender to another Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender
or such other Lender (provided that in the case of an assignment to any such
affiliate, the assigning Lender will not be released from its obligations under
the Loan Documents and Administrative Agent may continue to deal only with such
assigning Lender);


                                      106
<PAGE>

     (b) except to the extent Administrative Agent shall otherwise consent, any
such partial assignment (other than to another Lender or an affiliate of a
Lender) shall be in an amount at least equal to $10,000,000;

     (c) each such assignment (including an assignment to another Lender or an
affiliate of a Lender) by a Lender of its Loans or Commitment shall be made in
such manner so that the same portion of its Loans and Commitment is assigned to
the respective assignee;

     (d) subject to the applicable Lender's compliance with the provisions of
clauses (b) and (c) above, Administrative Agent's consent to an assignment shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned if (i) such assignment is
made to an Eligible Assignee, and (ii) the provisions of clause (e) have been
satisfied; and

     (e) upon execution and delivery by the assignee (even if already a Lender)
to Borrower and Administrative Agent of an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to
which such assignee agrees to become a "Lender" hereunder (if not already a
Lender) having the Commitment and Loans specified in such instrument, and upon
consent thereto by Administrative Agent to the extent required above, the
assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise
consented to by Administrative Agent), the obligations, rights and benefits of a
Lender hereunder holding the Commitment and Loans (or portions thereof) assigned
to it (in addition to the Commitment and Loans, if any, theretofore held by such
assignee) and, except as provided in Section 12.24(2)(a), the assigning Lender
shall, to the extent of such assignment, be released from the Commitment (or
portion thereof) so assigned. Upon each such assignment the assigning Lender
shall pay Administrative Agent a processing and recording fee of $3,500 and the
reasonable fees and disbursements of Administrative Agent's counsel incurred in
connection therewith.

          (3) Participations.

     (a) A Lender may sell or agree to sell to one or more other Persons (each a
"Participant") a participation in all or any part of any Loans held by it, or in
its Commitment, provided (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations and (C) Borrower, Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. In no event shall a Lender that sells a participation agree with the
Participant to take or refrain from taking any action hereunder or under any
other Loan Document except that such Lender may agree with the Participant that
it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase or
extend the term of such Lender's Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the
payment of principal of or interest on the related Loan or Loans or any portion
of any fee hereunder payable to the Participant, (iii) reduce the amount of any
such payment of principal, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable
thereon, or any fee hereunder payable to the Participant, to a level below the
rate at which the Participant is entitled to receive such interest or fee or (v)


                                      107
<PAGE>

consent to any modification, supplement or waiver hereof or of any of the other
Loan Documents to the extent that the same, under Section 12.2, requires the
consent of each Lender. Subject to subsection (3)(b) of this Section 12.24,
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.9(1), 2.9(5), and 2.9(6) to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (2) of this
Section 12.24. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 12.24 as though it were a Lender; provided
that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 12.24 as though it were a
Lender.

     (b) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.9(1) or 2.9(6) than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that is a non-U.S. Person that would become
a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.9(6) unless Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of Borrower, to comply with Section 2.9(6) as though it
were a Lender

          (4) Certain Pledges. In addition to the assignments and participations
     permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.24 (but without
     being subject thereto), any Lender may (without notice to Borrower,
     Administrative Agent or any other Lender and without payment of any fee)
     assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Note to any
     Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and
     any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank, and such Loans
     and Note shall be fully transferable as provided therein. No such
     assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations
     hereunder.

          (5) Provision of Information to Assignees and Participants. A Lender
     may furnish any information concerning Borrower, any Borrower Party or any
     of their respective Affiliates or the Project in the possession of such
     Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including
     prospective assignees and participants), provided that, prior any Lender
     furnishing to any such actual or prospective assignee or participant any
     material non-public information concerning the Borrower or any Borrower
     Party, such actual or prospective assignee or participant shall have
     executed a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of that
     attached hereto as Exhibit K (or have agreed to the terms thereof via
     electronic signature or similar electronic means).

          (6) Agent, Borrower and such participant/assignee Lender complies with
     the terms of Section 12.30.

          (7) No Assignments to Borrower or Affiliates. Anything in this Section
     12.24 to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate
     any interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to Borrower or any of its
     Affiliates without the prior consent of each Lender.

     Section 12.25 Brokers. Borrower hereby represents to Administrative Agent
and each Lender that Borrower has not dealt with any broker, underwriters,
placement agent, or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and
all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind in any way relating to
or arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of
Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

     Section 12.26 Right of Set-off.

          (1) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
     Default, each of the Lenders is, subject (as between the Lenders) to the
     provisions of subsection (3) of this Section 12.26, hereby authorized at
     any time and from time to time, without notice to Borrower (any such notice
     being expressly waived by Borrower) and to the fullest extent permitted by
     law, to set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
     demand, provisional or final) at any time held, and other indebtedness at
     any time owing, by such Lender in any of its offices, in Dollars or in any
     other currency, to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any
     and all of the respective obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing
     under the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or any
     other Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although such
     obligations may be contingent or unmatured and such deposits or
     indebtedness may be unmatured. Each Lender hereby acknowledges that the
     exercise by any Lender of offset, set-off, banker's lien, or similar rights
     against any deposit or other indebtedness of Borrower whether or not
     located in California or any other state with certain laws restricting
     lenders from pursuing multiple collection methods, could result under such
     laws in significant impairment of the ability of all the Lenders to recover
     any further amounts in respect of the Loan. Therefore, each Lender agrees
     that no Lender shall exercise any such right of set-off, banker's lien, or
     otherwise, against any assets of Borrower (including all general or
     special, time or demand, provisional or other deposits and other
     indebtedness owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of
     Borrower) without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent and the
     Majority Lenders.

          (2) Each Lender shall promptly notify Borrower and Administrative
     Agent after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to
     give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
     application. The rights of the Lenders under this Section 12.26 are in
     addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off)
     which the Lenders may have.

          (3) If an Event of Default has resulted in the Loans becoming due and
     payable prior to the stated maturity thereof, each Lender agrees that it
     shall turn over to Administrative Agent any payment (whether voluntary or
     involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff or otherwise) on
     account of the Loans held by it in excess of its ratable portion of
     payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders.


                                      109

     Section 12.27 Limitation on Liability of Administrative Agent's and the
Lenders' Officers, Employees, etc. Any obligation or liability whatsoever of
Administrative Agent or any Lender which may arise at any time under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be satisfied, if at all, out of
Administrative Agent's or such Lender's respective assets only. No such
obligation or liability shall be personally binding upon, nor shall resort for
the enforcement thereof be had to, the property of any of Administrative Agent's
or any Lender's shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents,
regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of contract,
tort or otherwise.

     Section 12.28 Cooperation with Syndication.

          (1) Borrower acknowledges that Eurohypo intends to syndicate a portion
     of the Commitments to one or more Lenders (the "Syndication") and in
     connection therewith, Borrower will take all actions as Eurohypo may
     reasonably request to assist Eurohypo in its Syndication effort. Without
     limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower shall, at the request of
     Eurohypo (i) facilitate the review of the Loan and the Project by any
     prospective Lender; (ii) assist Eurohypo and otherwise cooperate with
     Eurohypo in the preparation of information offering materials (which
     assistance may include reviewing and commenting on drafts of such
     information materials and drafting portions thereof); (iii) deliver updated
     information on Borrower, any Borrower Party and the Project; (iv) make
     representatives of Borrower available to meet with prospective Lenders at
     tours of the Project and bank meetings; (v) facilitate direct contact
     between the senior management and advisors of Borrower and any prospective
     Lender; and (vi) provide Eurohypo with all information reasonably deemed
     necessary by it to complete the Syndication successfully. Borrower agrees
     to take such further action, in connection with documents and amendments to
     the Loan Documents, as may reasonably be required to effect such
     Syndication.

          (2) Until such time as Eurohypo provides Borrower with written notice
     that the Syndication is complete, except for those financing transactions
     listed on Schedule 12.28 attached hereto, no other similar credit
     facilities or debts issued by Borrower or Sponsor will be syndicated or
     privately placed which might, in Eurohypo's opinion, have a detrimental
     effect on the successful completion of the Syndication. Borrower and
     Sponsor shall notify Eurohypo in writing immediately if any such credit
     facility or debt issuance is contemplated.

     Section 12.29 Loan Components. Eurohypo shall have the right, at any time,
to direct the Administrative Agent, with respect to all or any portion of the
Loan, to (a) cause the Notes, the Mortgage and the other Security Documents to
be severed and/or split into two or more separate notes, mortgages and other
security agreements, so as to evidence and secure one or more senior and
subordinate mortgage loans, (b) create one more senior and subordinate notes
(i.e., an A/B or A/B/C structure) secured by the Mortgage and the other Security
Documents, (c) create multiple components of the Notes (and allocate or
re-allocate the outstanding principal amount of the Loan among such components)


                                      110
<PAGE>

or (d) otherwise sever the Loan into two or more loans secured by the Mortgage
and the other Security Documents (each of clauses (a) through (d), a
"Bifurcation"); in each such case, in whatever proportions and priorities as
Eurohypo may so direct in its discretion to the Administrative Agent; provided,
however, that in each such instance (i) the outstanding principal amount of all
the Notes evidencing the Loan (or components of such Notes) immediately
following such Bifurcation shall be equal the outstanding principal amount of
the Loan immediately prior to such Bifurcation, and (ii) the weighted average
Applicable Margin with respect to the aggregate outstanding principal balance of
all Base Rate Loans and LIBOR-based Loans immediately after such Bifurcation and
at all times prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default shall not exceed the
weighted average Applicable Margin with respect to the aggregate outstanding
principal balance of all Base Rate Loans and LIBOR-based Loans as set forth in
the initial Notes delivered hereunder (as such interest rates are subject to
being adjusted from time to time in accordance herewith, including as a result
of the accrual of interest at the Default Rate). If requested by the
Administrative Agent in writing, Borrower shall execute within ten (10) days
after such request, a severance agreement, amendments to or amendments and
restatements of any one or more Loan Documents, and such documentation as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request to evidence and/or effectuate any
such Bifurcation, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Eurohypo
and the Administrative Agent; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other
provision of Section 12.28 or this Section 12.29(1) to the contrary, Borrower
shall not be required to enter into any such documents and amendments which
would alter any of the material economic terms of the Loan Documents or which
would create new or greater obligations or liabilities on Borrower or the
Borrower Parties under the Loan Documents.

                                  FULL RECOURSE

     Section 13.1 Full Recourse. The Loans and all obligations of the Borrower
under the Loan Documents shall be fully recourse to Borrower.


                                   ARTICLE 14

                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     Section 14.1 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Lender hereby
appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and of the other Loan
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Administrative Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in Section 14.5
and the first sentence of Section 14.6 shall include reference to its affiliates
and its own and its affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents):

     (a) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set
forth in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document be a trustee for any Lender except


                                      111
<PAGE>

to the extent that Administrative Agent acts as an agent with respect to the
receipt or payment of funds, nor shall Administrative Agent have any fiduciary
duty to Borrower nor shall any Lender have any fiduciary duty to Borrower or any
other Lender;

     (b) shall not be responsible to the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by
Borrower or any other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder; and

     (c) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any other document or
instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection
herewith or therewith, except to the extent any such action taken or omitted
violates Administrative Agent's standard of care set forth in the first sentence
of Section 14.5.

     (d) shall not, except to the extent expressly instructed by the Majority
Lenders with respect to collateral security under the Security Documents, be
required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings
hereunder or under any other Loan Document; and

     (e) shall not be required to take any action which is contrary to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law.

The relationship between Administrative Agent and each Lender is a contractual
relationship only, and nothing herein shall be deemed to impose on
Administrative Agent any obligations other than those for which express
provision is made herein or in the other Loan Documents. Administrative Agent
may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact, and may delegate all or any part of its
obligations hereunder, to third parties and shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any such agents, attorneys-in-fact or third parties
selected by it in good faith. Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of a Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a
notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with
Administrative Agent, any such assignment or transfer to be subject to the
provisions of Section 12.24. Except to the extent expressly provided in Sections
14.8, the provisions of this Article 14 are solely for the benefit of
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and Borrower shall not have any rights as
a third-party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof and the Lenders may
Modify or waive such provisions of this Article 14 in their sole and absolute
discretion..

     Section 14.2 Reliance by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telegram or
cable) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts
selected by Administrative Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for
by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent shall in all


                                      112
<PAGE>

cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or
thereunder in accordance with instructions given by the Majority Lenders, and
such instructions of the Majority Lenders and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

     Section 14.3 Defaults.

          (1) Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
     notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default unless Administrative Agent
     has received notice from a Lender or Borrower specifying such Event of
     Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event
     that Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of an
     Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
     the Lenders. Within ten (10) days of delivery of such notice of Event of
     Default from Administrative Agent to the Lenders (or such shorter period of
     time as Administrative Agent determines is necessary), Administrative Agent
     and the Lenders shall consult with each other to determine a proposed
     course of action. Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 14.7) take
     such action with respect to such Event of Default as shall be directed by
     the Majority Lenders, provided that, (A) unless and until Administrative
     Agent shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent may (but
     shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
     action, including decisions (1) to make protective advances that
     Administrative Agent determines are necessary to protect or maintain the
     Project and (2) to foreclose on any of the Project or exercise any other
     remedy, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in
     the interest of the Lenders except to the extent that this Agreement
     expressly requires that such action be taken, or not be taken, only with
     the consent or upon the authorization of all of the Lenders and (B) no
     actions approved by the Majority Lenders shall violate the Loan Documents
     or applicable law. Each of the Lenders acknowledges and agrees that no
     individual Lender may separately enforce or exercise any of the provisions
     of any of the Loan Documents (including the Notes) other than through
     Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of all
     material actions which Administrative Agent takes in accordance with the
     provisions of this Section 14.3(1) and shall continue to consult with the
     Lenders with respect to all of such actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
     if the Majority Lenders shall at any time direct that a different or
     additional remedial action be taken from that already undertaken by
     Administrative Agent, including the commencement of foreclosure
     proceedings, such different or additional remedial action shall be taken in
     lieu of or in addition to, the prosecution of such action taken by
     Administrative Agent; provided that all actions already taken by
     Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 14.3(1) shall be valid and
     binding on each Lender. All money (other than money subject to the
     provisions of Section 14.7) received from any enforcement actions,
     including the proceeds of a foreclosure sale of the Project, shall be
     applied, first, to the payment or reimbursement of Administrative Agent for
     expenses incurred in accordance with the provisions of Sections 14.3(2),
     (3) and (4) and 14.5 and to the payment of the Agency Fee to the extent not
     paid by Borrower pursuant to Section 14.11, second, to the payment or


                                      113
<PAGE>

     reimbursement of the Lenders for expenses incurred in accordance with the
     provisions of Sections 14.3(2), (3) and (4) and 14.5; third, to the payment
     or reimbursement of the Lenders for any advances made pursuant to Section
     14.3(2); and fourth, pari passu to the Lenders in accordance with their
     respective Proportionate Shares (and to the Lender or Lenders under any
     Hedge Agreement for its Additional Interest in accordance with Section
     9.15), unless an Unpaid Amount is owed pursuant to Section 14.12, in which
     event such Unpaid Amount shall be deducted from the portion of such
     proceeds of the Defaulting Lender and be applied to payment of such Unpaid
     Amount to the Special Advance Lender.

          (2) All losses with respect to interest (including interest at the
     Default Rate) and other sums payable pursuant to the Notes or incurred in
     connection with the Loans shall be borne by the Lenders in accordance with
     their respective proportionate shares of the Loans. All losses incurred in
     connection with the Loans, the enforcement thereof or the realization of
     the security therefor, shall be borne by the Lenders in accordance with
     their respective proportionate shares of the Loan, and the Lenders shall
     promptly, upon request, remit to Administrative Agent their respective
     proportionate shares of (i) any expenses incurred by Administrative Agent
     in connection with any Default to the extent any expenses have not been
     paid by Borrower, (ii) any advances made to pay taxes or insurance or
     otherwise to preserve the Lien of the Security Documents or to preserve and
     protect the Project, whether or not the amount necessary to be advanced for
     such purposes exceeds the amount of the Mortgage, (iii) any other expenses
     incurred in connection with the enforcement of the Mortgage or other Loan
     Documents, and (iv) any expenses incurred in connection with the
     consummation of the Loans not paid or provided for by Borrower. To the
     extent any such advances are recovered in connection with the enforcement
     of the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents, each Lender shall be paid its
     proportionate share of such recovery after deduction of the expenses of
     Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

          (3) If, at the direction of the Majority Lenders or otherwise as
     provided in Section 14.3(1), any action(s) is brought to collect on the
     Notes or enforce the Security Documents or any other Loan Document, such
     action shall (to the extent permitted under applicable law and the
     decisions of the court in which such action is brought) be an action
     brought by Administrative Agent and the Lenders, collectively, to collect
     on all or a portion of the Notes or enforce the Security Documents or any
     other Loan Document and counsel selected by Administrative Agent shall
     prosecute any such action on behalf of Administrative Agent and the
     Lenders, and Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall consult and
     cooperate with each other in the prosecution thereof. All decisions
     concerning the appointment of a receiver while such action is pending, the
     conduct of such receivership, the conduct of such action, the collection of
     any judgment entered in such action and the settlement of such action shall
     be made by Administrative Agent. The costs and expenses of any such action
     shall be borne by the Lenders in accordance with each of their respective
     proportionate shares.


                                      114
<PAGE>

          (4) If, at the direction of the Majority Lenders or otherwise as
     provided in Section 14.3(1), any action(s) is brought to foreclose the
     Mortgage, such action shall (to the extent permitted under applicable law
     and the decisions of the court in which such action is brought) be an
     action brought by Administrative Agent and the Lenders, collectively, to
     foreclose all or a portion of the Mortgage and collect on the Notes.
     Counsel selected by Administrative Agent shall prosecute any such
     foreclosure on behalf of Administrative Agent and the Lenders and
     Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall consult and cooperate with each
     other in the prosecution thereof. All decisions concerning the appointment
     of a receiver, the conduct of such foreclosure, the acceptance of a deed in
     lieu of foreclosure, the bid on behalf of Administrative Agent and the
     Lenders at the foreclosure sale of the Project, the manner of taking and
     holding title to the Project (other than as set forth in subsection (5)
     below), the sale of the Project after foreclosure, and the commencement and
     conduct of any deficiency judgment proceeding shall be made by
     Administrative Agent. The costs and expenses of foreclosure will be borne
     by the Lenders in accordance with their respective proportionate shares.

          (5) If title is acquired to the Project after a foreclosure sale or by
     a deed in lieu of foreclosure, title shall be held by Administrative Agent
     in its own name in trust for the Lenders or, at Administrative Agent's
     election, in the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Administrative Agent
     on behalf of the Lenders.

          (6) If Administrative Agent (or its subsidiary) acquires title to the
     Project or is entitled to possession of the Project during or after the
     foreclosure, all material decisions with respect to the possession,
     ownership, development, construction, control, operation, leasing,
     management and sale of the Project shall be made by Administrative Agent.
     All income or other money received after so acquiring title to or taking
     possession of the Project with respect to the Project, including income
     from the operation and management of the Project and the proceeds of a sale
     of the Project, shall be applied, first, to the payment or reimbursement of
     Administrative Agent and the expenses incurred in accordance with the
     provisions of this Article 14 and to the payment of the Agency Fee to the
     extent not paid by Borrower pursuant to Section 14.11, second, to the
     payment of operating expenses with respect to the Project; third, to the
     establishment of reasonable reserves for the operation of the Project;
     fourth, to the payment or reimbursement of the Lenders for any advances
     made pursuant to Section 14.3(2); fifth to fund any capital improvement,
     leasing and other reserves; and sixth, to the Lenders in accordance with
     their respective Proportionate Shares (and to each of the Lenders under any
     applicable Hedge Agreement for its Additional Interest in accordance with
     Section 9.15), unless an Unpaid Amount is owed pursuant to Section 14.12,
     in which event such Unpaid Amount shall be deducted from the portion of
     such proceeds of the Defaulting Lender and be applied to payment of such
     Unpaid Amount to the Special Advance Lender.


                                      115
<PAGE>

     Section 14.4 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Commitment and the
Loans made by it Eurohypo (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) in
its capacity as a Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and powers
hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
acting as Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless
the context otherwise indicates, include Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. Eurohypo (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) and its
affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Lender) lend money to,
make investments in and generally engage in any kind of lending, trust or other
business with Borrower (and any of its Affiliates) as if it were not acting as
Administrative Agent, and Eurohypo and its affiliates may accept fees and other
consideration from Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

     Section 14.5 Standard of Care; Indemnification. In performing its duties
under the Loan Documents, Administrative Agent will exercise the same degree of
care as it normally exercises in connection with real estate loans in which no
syndication or participations are involved, but Administrative Agent shall have
no further responsibility to any Lender except as expressly provided herein and
except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct which resulted in
actual loss to such Lender, and, except to such extent, Administrative Agent
shall have no responsibility to any Lender for the failure by Administrative
Agent to comply with any of Administrative Agent's obligations to Borrower under
the Loan Documents or otherwise. The Lenders agree to indemnify Administrative
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.5, but without limiting the
obligations of Borrower under Section 12.5) ratably in accordance with the
aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by the Lenders (or, if no Loans are
at the time outstanding, ratably in accordance with their respective
Commitments), for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against Administrative Agent (including by any Lender) arising out of or by
reason of any investigation in or in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including, without limitation, the costs and expenses that Borrower is
obligated to pay under Section 12.5, but excluding, unless a Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses
incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement
of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents, provided
that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise
from Administrative Agent's breach of its standard of care set forth in the
first sentence of this Section.

     Section 14.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on Administrative
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of Borrower and its Affiliates
and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and
without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document. Subject to the provisions
of the first sentence of Section 14.5, Administrative Agent shall not be
required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by Borrower


                                      116
<PAGE>

of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other document
referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the Project or the
books of Borrower or any of its Affiliates. Except for notices, reports and
other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by Administrative Agent hereunder or as otherwise agreed by
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of Borrower
or any of its Affiliates that may come into the possession of Administrative
Agent or any of its affiliates.

     Section 14.7 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of
Administrative Agent hereunder, and under the other Loan Documents,
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or
refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive further
assurances to its satisfaction from the Lenders of their indemnification
obligations under Section 14.5 against any and all liability and expense that
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

     Section 14.8 Resignation of Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Lenders and Borrower and the
Majority Lenders (other than Administrative Agent) may remove Administrative
Agent at any time for gross negligence or willful misconduct by giving at least
thirty (30) Business Days' prior written notice and cure period to
Administrative Agent, Borrower and all other Lenders. Upon any such resignation
or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Administrative Agent that shall be a Person that meets the qualifications of an
Eligible Assignee. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or its receipt of notice of removal, then the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, that shall be an institutional lender that meets the
requirements of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or
retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged
therefrom as provided above in this Section 14.8). The fees payable by Borrower
to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. After
any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative
Agent, the provision of this Article 14 and Section 12.5 shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

     Section 14.9 Consents under Loan Documents. Administrative Agent may as
expressly provided in the Loan Documents and, if not expressly provided, with
the consent of the Majority Lenders (a) grant any consent or approval required
of it or (b) consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the
Loan Documents. If Administrative Agent solicits any consents or approvals from
the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, each Lender shall within ten (10)
Business Days of receiving such request, give Administrative Agent written
notice of its consent or approval or denial thereof; provided that, if any
Lender does not respond within such ten (10) Business Days, such Lender shall be


                                      117
<PAGE>

deemed to have authorized Administrative Agent to vote such Lender's interest
with respect to the matter which was the subject of Administrative Agent's
solicitation as Administrative Agent elects. Any such solicitation by
Administrative Agent for a consent or approval shall be in writing and shall
include a description of the matter or thing as to which such consent or
approval is requested and shall include Administrative Agent's recommended
course of action or determination in respect thereof. Borrower and such
successor. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article 14 and Section 12.5 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

     Section 14.10 Authorization. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by
the Lenders to execute, deliver and perform in accordance with the terms of each
of the Loan Documents to which Administrative Agent is or is intended to be a
party and each Lender agrees to be bound by all of the agreements of
Administrative Agent contained in such Loan Documents. Borrower shall be
entitled to rely on all written agreements, approvals and consents received from
Administrative Agent as being that also of the Lenders, without obtaining
separate acknowledgment or proof of authorization of same.

     Section 14.11 Agency Fee. So long as the Commitments are in effect and
until payment in full of all obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the
other Loan Documents, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, for its sole
account, the Agency Fee. The Agency Fee shall be payable annually in advance
commencing on the Closing Date pursuant to the Fee Letter.

     Section 14.12 Defaulting Lenders.

          (1) If any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") shall for any reason fail to
     (i) make any respective Loan required pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement or (ii) pay its proportionate share of an advance or disbursement
     to protect the Project or the Lien of the Security Documents, any of the
     other Lenders may, but shall not be obligated to, make all or a portion of
     the Defaulting Lender's Loan or proportionate share of such advance,
     provided that such Lender gives the Defaulting Lender and Administrative
     Agent prior notice of its intention to do so. The right to make such
     advances in respect of the Defaulting Lender shall be exercisable first by
     the Lender holding the greatest proportionate share and thereafter to each
     of the Lenders in descending order of their respective proportionate shares
     of the Loans or in such other manner as the Majority Lenders (excluding the
     Defaulting Lender) may agree on. Any Lender making all or any portion of
     the Defaulting Lender's proportionate share of the applicable Loan or
     advance in accordance with the foregoing terms and conditions shall be
     referred to as a "Special Advance Lender".

          (2) In any case where a Lender becomes a Special Advance Lender (i)
     the Special Advance Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, and the
     Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have sold, a senior participation in
     the Defaulting Lender's respective Loan to the extent of the amount so
     advanced or disbursed (the "Advanced Amount") bearing interest (including
     interest at the Default Rate, if applicable) and (ii) the Defaulting Lender
     shall have no voting rights under this Agreement or any other Loan
     Documents so long as it is a Defaulting Lender. It is expressly understood


                                      118
<PAGE>

     and agreed that each of the respective obligations under this Agreement and
     the other Loan Documents, including advancing Loans, losses incurred in
     connection with the Loan, including costs and expenses of enforcement,
     advancing to preserve the Lien of the Mortgage or to preserve and protect
     the Project, shall be without regard to any adjustment in the proportionate
     shares occasioned by the acts of a Defaulting Lender. The Special Advance
     Lender shall be entitled to an amount (the "Unpaid Amount") equal to the
     applicable Advanced Amount, plus any unpaid interest due and owing with
     respect thereto, less any repayments thereof made by the Defaulting Lender
     immediately upon demand. The Defaulting Lender shall have the right to
     repurchase the senior participation in its Loan from the Special Advance
     Lender at any time by the payment of the Unpaid Amount.

          (3) A Special Advance Lender shall (i) give notice to the Defaulting
     Lender, Administrative Agent and each of the other Lenders (provided that
     failure to deliver said notice to any party other than the Defaulting
     Lender shall not constitute a default under this Agreement) of the Advance
     Amount and the percentage of the Special Advance Lender's senior
     participation in the Defaulting Lender's Loan and (ii) in the event of the
     repayment of any of the Unpaid Amount by the Defaulting Lender, give notice
     to the Defaulting Lender and Administrative Agent of the fact that the
     Unpaid Amount has been repaid (in whole or in part), the amount of such
     repayment and, if applicable, the revised percentage of the Special Advance
     Lender's senior participation. Provided that Administrative Agent has
     received notice of such participation, Administrative Agent shall have the
     same obligations to distribute interest, principal and other sums received
     by Administrative Agent with respect to a Special Advance Lender's senior
     participation as Administrative Agent has with respect to the distribution
     of interest, principal and other sums under this Agreement; and at the time
     of making any distributions to the Lenders, shall make payments to the
     Special Advance Lender with respect to a Special Advance Lender's senior
     participation in the Defaulting Lender's Loan out of the Defaulting
     Lender's share of any such distributions.

          (4) A Defaulting Lender shall immediately pay to a Special Advance
     Lender all sums of any kind paid to or received by the Defaulting Lender
     from Borrower, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other
     Loan Documents or in connection with the realization of the security
     therefor until the Unpaid Amount is fully repaid. Notwithstanding the fact
     that the Defaulting Lender may temporarily hold such sums, the Defaulting
     Lender shall be deemed to hold same as a trustee for the benefit of the
     Special Advance Lender, it being the express intention of the Lenders that
     the Special Advance Lender shall have an ownership interest in such sums to
     the extent of the Unpaid Amount.


                                      119
<PAGE>

          (5) Each Defaulting Lender shall indemnify, defend and hold
     Administrative Agent and each of the other Lenders harmless from and
     against any and all losses, damages, liabilities or expenses (including
     reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and interest at the Default Rate)
     which they may sustain or incur by reason of the Defaulting Lender's
     failure or refusal to abide by its obligations under this Agreement or the
     other Loan Documents, except to the extent a Defaulting Lender became a
     Defaulting Lender due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
     Administrative Agent and/or any Lender. Administrative Agent shall, after
     payment of any amounts due to any Special Advance Lender pursuant to the
     terms of subsection (3) above, set-off against any payments due to such
     Defaulting Lender for the claims of Administrative Agent and the other
     Lenders pursuant to this indemnity.

     Section 14.13 Liability of Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent shall
not have any liabilities or responsibilities to Borrower on account of the
failure of any Lender (other than Administrative Agent in its capacity as a
Lender) to perform its obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the
failure of Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan
Document.

     Section 14.14 Transfer of Agency Function. Without the consent of Borrower
or any Lender, Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time
transfer its functions as Administrative Agent hereunder to any of its offices
wherever located in the United States; provided that Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders thereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The ability of Eurohypo AG, New York Branch ("Eurohypo") and/or its
affiliates to provide you with certain non-public information (whether in
written, oral, electronic or other form, all such information being hereinafter
referred to as the "Confidential Information") concerning loan in the amount of
up to $90 million, to be secured by a first mortgage on a regional shopping
center located in Puente Hills, California and commonly known as "Puente Hills
Mall" (the "Transaction") for Puente Hills Mall, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, and its affiliates, Glimcher Realty Trust, a Maryland real
estate investment trust, and OMERS Realty Corporation, a Canadian corporation
(collectively, the "Company") under discussion is contingent on your agreeing to
keep the Confidential Information confidential.

     By signing in the space provided below, you agree to keep the Confidential
Information confidential from everyone other than your directors, officers,
employees and agents (collectively, your "Representatives") who are or are
expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or
administering the Transaction. You may, however, disclose the Confidential
Information (a) upon the request or demand, of any regulatory agency or
authority having jurisdiction over you, (b) to the extent the Confidential
Information is public or has become public other than through disclosure by you
or your Representatives and (c) to your legal counsel and independent auditors
as required in connection with the operation of your business. In the event that
you are requested or required by any court or administrative agency or pursuant
to any subpoena, interrogatory or similar process to disclose any of the
Confidential Information, you shall, unless specifically prohibited by law,
provide Eurohypo and the Company with immediate written notice thereof so that
an appropriate protective order may be sought or compliance herewith waived.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the Transaction
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are or have been provided to you relating to the tax treatment or tax structure;
provided, however, that with respect to any document or similar item that in
either case contains information concerning such tax treatment or tax structure
of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as other information, this
sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item that
relate to such tax treatment or tax structure.

     You hereby acknowledge that the Confidential Information is proprietary and
valuable and you agree not to use the Confidential Information for any purpose
whatsoever except for evaluating the Transaction. You agree that all of your
non-employee Representatives having access to the Confidential Information shall
have executed with you an agreement substantially similar to this
confidentiality agreement ("Confidentiality Agreement") and you agree to enforce
such agreement(s). You agree to protect the Confidential Information with at
least the same standard of care and procedures that you use to protect your own
trade secrets and confidential proprietary information, but in no event may such
standard of care be less than that of professional reasonable care. Upon prior
written request of Eurohypo, you will provide a list of persons who have or had
or will have access to the Confidential Information. You agree to maintain a
permanent record of all confidentiality agreements executed pursuant to this
Confidentiality Agreement. You shall be responsible for any breach of this
Confidentiality Agreement by any of your Representatives and you shall indemnify
Eurohypo and the Company and their respective affiliates for any loss,
liability, cost or expense, including attorneys' fees, incurred by Eurohypo or
any of their respective affiliates in connection therewith except to the extent
that a claim arises from Eurohypo's or the Company's or their respective
affiliates' gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     You understand and agree that the Confidential Information furnished to you
has been prepared by [________________________] and contains certain projections
concerning the Company. None of Eurohypo or the company or their respective
affiliates make any representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy
or completeness of the Confidential Information. Nothing contained therein is,
or can be relied on as, a promise or representation as to the future, although
the Company believes that such projections are realistic.

     In the event that you determine not to proceed with the Transaction, you
agree promptly to advise Eurohypo of your decision and promptly, upon Eurohypo's
or the Company's written request, to return all the Confidential Information to
Eurohypo or the Company or to destroy it and certify its destruction to Eurohypo
and the Company.

     You acknowledge that should Eurohypo or the Company allege that you or any
of your Representatives have breached this Confidentiality Agreement, Eurohypo
or the Company, as applicable, is entitled to seek a temporary restraining
order, preliminary injunction or other legal redress for your actions, or those
of your Representatives, in the U.S. Federal District Court for the Southern
District of New York or the courts of the State of New York located in New York
County (and appellate courts from any thereof) and you hereby consent to the
jurisdiction of such courts should Eurohypo or the Company seek such a remedy or
in connection with any dispute relating to this Confidentiality Agreement.
EUROHYPO, THE COMPANY AND YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, your obligation to keep
the Confidential Information confidential as set forth herein shall
automatically terminate on the earlier of (a) five (5) years from the date of
this Confidentiality Agreement or (b) upon written notification from the Company
and Eurohypo.

     The validity, construction and performance of this Confidentiality
Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York,
without regard to provisions regarding conflicts of law.

     No waiver, amendment or modification of any provisions of this
Confidentiality Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the
party against whom such waiver, amendment or modification is sought to be
enforced. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or
remedy under this Confidentiality Agreement, except as specifically provided in
this Confidentiality Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of any such right,
power or remedy. The parties to this Confidentiality Agreement intend that the
Company shall be a beneficiary of this Confidentiality Agreement entitled to
enforce its provisions to the same extent as if it were a signatory hereto.

     Please indicate your agreement by signing below and returning this
Confidentiality Agreement to Eurohypo Bank AG, New York Branch.

Retail Asset.

5. No lease (as extended, amended or otherwise modified, if applicable) shall
