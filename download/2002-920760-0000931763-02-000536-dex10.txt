--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


         WAREHOUSING CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of June 25, 2001,
         between UNIVERSAL AMERICAN MORTGAGE COMPANY, a Florida corporation
         ("UAMC"), EAGLE HOME MORTGAGE, INC., a Washington corporation ("EHMI"),
         AMERISTAR FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC., a California corporation ("AFSI"),
         UNIVERSAL AMERICAN MORTGAGE CO. OF CALIFORNIA, a California corporation
         ("UAMCC"), UAMC ASSET CORP. II, a Nevada corporation ("UAMC Asset")
         (UAMC, EHMI, AFSI, UAMCC and UAMC Asset, collectively, "Borrower"),
         RESIDENTIAL FUNDING CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("RFC"), (RFC
         and any Additional Lender as may from time to time become a party
         hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns being
         referred to individually as a "Lender" and collectively as the
         "Lenders"), and RFC as credit agent for Lenders (in such capacity, the
         "Credit Agent").

                  A.       Borrower has requested certain financing from
                           Lenders.

                  B.       Lenders have agreed to provide that financing to
                           Borrower subject to the terms and conditions of this
                           Agreement.

                  C.       The "Closing Date" for the transactions contemplated
                           by this Agreement is June 25, 2001.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:


1.       THE CREDIT


1.1.     The Warehousing Commitment

         On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Lenders
         agree, severally and not jointly, to make Warehousing Advances to
         Borrower from the Closing Date to the Business Day immediately
         preceding the Maturity Date, pro rata in accordance with their
         respective Percentage Shares, during which period Borrower may borrow,
         repay and reborrow in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
         On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, RFC
         agrees to make RFC Direct Advances to Borrower from the Closing Date to
         the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, during which
         period Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow in accordance with the
         provisions of this Agreement. Effective as of the Closing Date, Lenders
         shall make Warehousing Advances and RFC shall make RFC Direct Advances
         in an amount equal to all loans outstanding under the Existing U.S.
         Home Agreement, and such Advances shall be applied by Credit Agent to
         repay such outstanding loans. In Credit Agent's discretion, Warehousing
         Advances and RFC Direct Advances may be made on or after June 30, 2001,
         against Eligible Assets previously financed under the Existing
         Universal Agreement, in connection with the repayment in full of
         Borrower's Debt under the Existing Universal Agreement. The total
         aggregate principal amount of all Warehousing Advances and Swingline
         Advances outstanding at any one time may not exceed the Warehousing
         Credit Limit, and the total aggregate principal amount of all RFC
         Direct Advances outstanding at any one time will not exceed the RFC
         Direct Commitment Amount. While a Default or Event of Default exists,
         Lenders may refuse to make any additional Warehousing Advances and RFC
         may refuse to make additional RFC Direct Advances to Borrower. All
         Warehousing Advances, RFC Direct Advances

                                                                          Page 1
<PAGE>

         and Swingline Advances under this Agreement constitute a single
         indebtedness, and all of the Collateral is security for the Notes and
         for the performance of all of the Obligations.


1.2.     Expiration of Warehousing Commitment

         The Commitments expire on the earlier of ("Maturity Date"): (a) with
         respect to each Lender's Warehousing Commitment, June 24, 2002 or June
         24, 2003, as set forth on Exhibit J, and with respect to the RFC Direct
         Commitments, June 24, 2003, as such date(s) may be extended in writing
         by the applicable Lenders, in their sole discretion, on which dates the
         Commitments will expire of their own terms and the related Advances
         will become due and payable, in each case without the necessity of
         Notice or action by Lenders, and (b) the date the Commitments are
         terminated and the Advances become due and payable under Section 11.2.


1.3.     Swingline Facility

         On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, RFC may,
         from time to time to, but not including, the Business Day immediately
         preceding the Maturity Date, make Warehousing Advances ("Swingline
         Advances") requested by Borrower, in an aggregate not to exceed the
         Swingline Facility Amount, without requesting Warehousing Advances from
         the other Lenders. Lenders hereby agree to purchase from RFC an
         undivided participation interest in all outstanding Swingline Advances
         at any time in an amount equal to each Lender's Percentage Share of
         such Swingline Advances. RFC may at any time in its sole and absolute
         discretion (and shall no less frequently than weekly and upon the
         acceleration of the Obligations following an Event of Default) request
         Lenders to make Warehousing Advances in principal amounts equal to
         their Percentage Shares of outstanding Swingline Advances, and each
         Lender absolutely and unconditionally agrees to fund such Warehousing
         Advances, regardless of any Default or Event of Default or other
         condition which would otherwise excuse such Lender from funding
         Warehousing Advances, provided that no Lender shall be required to make
         Advances to repay Swingline Advances which would cause such Lender's
         aggregate Warehousing Advances then outstanding to exceed the amount of
         such Lender's Warehousing Commitment Amount. Each Lender's Warehousing
         Advances made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be delivered
         directly to RFC in immediately available funds at the office of Credit
         Agent by 4:00 p.m. on the day of the request therefor by RFC if such
         request is made on or before 3:00 p.m., or by 9:00 a.m. on the 1st
         Business Day following such request if such request is made after 3:00
         p.m., and shall be promptly applied against the outstanding Swingline
         Advances. At the time of any request for Warehousing Advances from
         Lenders pursuant to this Section 1.3, Credit Agent shall deliver to
         each Lender a certificate in the form of Exhibit K attached hereto (the
         "Advance Certificate"), certified by Credit Agent. For purposes of the
         limitations set forth in Exhibit H hereto, Swingline Advances shall be
         deemed to be Warehousing Advances.


1.4.     Notes

         Warehousing Advances made by each Lender against Eligible Assets other
         than Agreements for Deed and Foreclosure Claim Receivables are
         evidenced by Borrower's promissory note, payable to each Lender, in the
         form prescribed by Credit Agent (each, a "Warehousing Note").
         Warehousing Advances made by each Lender against Agreements for Deed or
         Foreclosure Claim Receivables are evidenced by Borrower's promissory
         note, payable to each Lender, in the form prescribed by the Credit
         Agent (each, a "Sublimit Note"). RFC Direct Advances made by RFC are
         evidenced by Borrower's promissory note, payable to RFC, in the form
         prescribed by the Credit Agent (the "RFC Direct Note"). Swingline
         Advances of Borrower in favor of RFC are evidenced by Borrower's
         promissory note, payable to RFC, in the form prescribed by Credit Agent
         (the "Swingline Note"). The terms "Warehousing Note," "Sublimit Note,"
         "RFC Direct Note" and "Swingline Note," as used in this Agreement,
         include all amendments, restatements,

                                                                          Page 2
<PAGE>

         renewals or replacements of the original "Warehousing Notes," "Sublimit
         Note," "RFC Direct Note" and "Swingline Note," and all substitutions
         for any of them. All terms and provisions of the "Warehousing Notes,"
         "Sublimit Note," "RFC Direct Note" and "Swingline Note" are
         incorporated into this Agreement.


1.5.     Non-Receipt of funds by Credit Agent.

         If Credit Agent receives notice from a Lender that such Lender does not
         intend to make its Percentage Share of any Warehousing Advances,
         neither Credit Agent nor any other Lender shall have any obligation to
         fund such Lender's Percentage Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
         unless a Lender notifies Credit Agent by 3:00 p.m. on the date of a
         proposed Warehousing Advance that it does not intend to make its
         Percentage Share of such Warehousing Advance available to Credit Agent
         at such time and on such date, Credit Agent may assume that such Lender
         will make such amount available to Credit Agent to be advanced to
         Borrower, and in reliance on such assumption, Credit Agent may, at its
         option, make a corresponding amount available to Borrower.

         1.5(a)   If Credit Agent makes such corresponding amount available to
                  Borrower and such amount is not made available to Credit Agent
                  by such Lender by close of business on the date of the
                  Warehousing Advance, such Lender shall pay such amount to
                  Credit Agent upon demand plus interest to the date of payment
                  at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

         1.5(b)   If a Lender fails to pay as provided herein, Borrower shall
                  pay such amount to Credit Agent upon demand plus interest (at
                  the rate applicable to Borrower for such Warehousing Advance)
                  to the date of repayment.

         1.5(c)   Nothing in this Section 1.5 shall relieve any Lender from its
                  obligation to fund its Percentage Share of any Advance, or
                  prejudice any rights Borrower may have against any Lender as a
                  result of such Lender's failure to make its Percentage Share
                  of any Advance


1.6.     Replacement Notes.

         Upon receipt by Credit Agent of an affidavit of an officer of any
         Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note,
         and, in the case of any such mutilation, upon receipt by Credit Agent

3.       PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING ADVANCES


3.1.     Warehousing Advances

         3.1(a)   To obtain a Warehousing Advance or an RFC Direct Advance under
                  this Agreement, Borrower must deliver to Credit Agent, either
                  a completed and signed request for an Advance on the then
                  current form approved by Credit Agent or an Electronic Advance
                  Request, together with a list of Mortgage Loans for which the
                  request is being made and a completed and signed RFConnects
                  Pledge Agreement sent by facsimile ("Advance Request"), not
                  later than (i) in the case of Electronic Advance Requests,
                  3:30 p.m. on the Business Day on which Borrower desires the
                  Advance, and (ii) in all other cases, unless the Credit Agent
                  agrees otherwise, one Business Day before the Business Day on
                  which Borrower desires the Advance. Subject to the delivery of
                  a Advance Request, Borrower may obtain an Advance under this
                  Agreement upon compliance with the procedures set forth in
                  this Section and in the applicable Exhibit B, including
                  delivery to Credit Agent of all required Collateral Documents.
                  Credit Agent's current form of Advance Request is set forth in
                  the applicable Exhibit A. Upon not less than 3 Business Days'
                  prior Notice to Borrower, Credit Agent may modify its form of
                  Advance Request and any other Exhibit referred to in this
                  Section to conform to either current legal requirements or
                  Credit Agent practices and, as so modified, those Exhibits
                  will be deemed a part of this Agreement.

         3.1(b)   Credit Agent has a reasonable time to examine Borrower's
                  Advance Request and the Collateral Documents to be delivered
                  by Borrower before funding the requested Advance, and may
                  reject any Eligible Asset that does not meet the requirements
                  of this Agreement or of the related Purchase Commitment.

         3.1(c)   Borrower must hold or cause its custodian to hold, in trust
                  for Credit Agent, those original Collateral Documents of which
                  only copies are required to be delivered to Credit Agent under
                  Exhibit B. Unless a Pledged Loan is being held by an Investor
                  for purchase or has been redeemed from pledge by Borrower,
                  promptly upon request by Credit Agent or, if the recorded
                  Collateral Documents have not yet been returned from the
                  recording office, immediately upon receipt by Borrower or its
                  custodian of those recorded Collateral Documents, Borrower
                  must deliver or cause its custodian to deliver to Credit Agent
                  any or all of the original Collateral Documents.

         3.1(d)   To fund Warehousing Advances, RFC Direct Advances and
                  Swingline Advances under this Agreement, Credit Agent will
                  cause the Funding Bank to credit either the Wire Disbursement
                  Account or Check Disbursement Account upon compliance by
                  Borrower with the terms of the Loan Documents. Credit Agent
                  will determine, in its sole discretion, the method by which
                  Advances and other amounts on deposit in the Wire Disbursement
                  Account or Check Disbursement Account are disbursed by the
                  Funding Bank to or for the account of Borrower.

         3.1(e)   If, under the authorization given by Borrower in the Funding
                  Bank Agreement, Credit Agent (i) debits Borrower's Operating
                  Account to cover a wire to be initiated by Credit Agent for
                  the purpose of financing a Pledged Asset against which Lenders
                  have made Warehousing Advances, or (ii) directs the Funding
                  Bank to honor a check drawn by Borrower's on its Check
                  Disbursement Account at the Funding Bank, and that debit or
                  direction results in an overdraft, RFC may make an additional
                  Swingline Advance to fund that overdraft.

                                                                          Page 7

3.2.     Wet Settlement Advances

         Collateral Documents not required for a Wet Settlement Advance must be
         delivered by Borrower to Credit Agent within 7 Business Days after the
         date of the Wet Settlement Advance.



                                End of Article 3

                                                                          Page 8

4.       INTEREST, PRINCIPAL AND FEES


4.1.     Interest

         4.1(a)   Except as provided in Sections 4.1(b), 4.1(d) and 4.1(e),
                  Borrower must pay interest on the unpaid amount of each
                  Advance from the date the Advance is made until it is paid in
                  full at the Interest Rate specified in Exhibit H.

         4.1(b)   Borrower and any Lender may enter into an agreement (a
                  "Balance Funded Agreement") pursuant to which Borrower agrees
                  to maintain Deposit Balances on deposit with such Lender or a
                  Designated Bank in consideration of the funding of all or a
                  portion of such Lender's Advances against Prime Mortgage Loans
                  at a Balance Funded Rate. Borrower may give written notice to
                  any Lender with which it has a Balance Funded Agreement, as
                  and when provided in such Balance Funded Agreement, of
                  Borrower's election to have a portion (the "Balance Funded
                  Portion") of the principal amount of Lender's Advances against
                  Prime Mortgage Loans bear interest at the Balance Funded Rate
                  during any calendar month. In the event Borrower elects to
                  have all or a portion of any Lender's Advances against Prime
                  Mortgage Loans bear interest at the Balance Funded Rate during
                  any month, such Lender shall notify Credit Agent no later than
                  12:00 Noon on the second Business Day of the following month
                  of the estimated amount by which the interest to be paid by
                  Borrower on such Lender's Advances during such month was
                  reduced as a result of the application of such Balance Funded
                  Agreement. If the Deposit Balances maintained by Borrower with
                  such Lender or its Designated Bank during such month are less
                  than the Balance Funded Portion, or if the estimate provided
                  by Lender pursuant to the previous sentence is not accurate,
                  Lender may charge and separately bill Borrower a deficiency
                  fee (a "Balance Deficiency Fee"), or credit Borrower with any
                  amount by which interest billed exceeded interest actually
                  due, the amount of which shall be set forth in the Balance
                  Funded Agreement between Borrower and such Lender.

         4.1(c)   Credit Agent computes interest on the basis of the actual
                  number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Interest is
                  payable monthly in arrears, as provided in Section 4.7.

         4.1(d)   After an Event of Default occurs and upon Notice to Borrower
                  by Credit Agent, the unpaid amount of each Warehousing Advance
                  or RFC Direct Advance will bear interest at the Default Rate
                  until the Event of Default has been waived or cured, as
                  provided herein, or the Warehousing Advance has been paid in
                  full.

         4.1(e)   The rates of interest provided for in this Agreement will be
                  adjusted as of the effective date of each change in the
                  applicable index. Credit Agent's determination of such rates
                  of interest as of any date of determination are conclusive and
                  binding, absent manifest error.


4.2.     Interest Limitation

         Lenders do not intend, by reason of this Agreement, the Notes or any
         other Loan Document, to receive interest in an amount in excess of that
         permitted by applicable law. If Lenders receive any interest in excess
         of the amount permitted by applicable law, whether by reason of
         acceleration of the maturity of this Agreement, the Notes or otherwise,
         Lenders will apply the excess to the unpaid principal balance of the
         Advances and not to the payment of interest. If all Advances have been
         paid in full and the Commitments have expired or have been terminated,
         Lenders will remit any excess to Borrower. This Section controls every
         other provision of all

                                                                          Page 9
<PAGE>

         agreements between Borrower and Lenders and is binding upon and
         available to any subsequent holder of the Notes.


4.3.     Principal Payments

         4.3(a)   Borrower must pay the outstanding principal amount of all
                  Warehousing Advances and RFC Direct Advances on the applicable
                  Maturity Date, and the outstanding principal amount of all
                  Swingline Advances on the final Maturity Date.

         4.3(b)   Borrower may prepay any portion of the Advances without
                  premium or penalty at any time.

         4.3(c)   Borrower must pay to Credit Agent for the pro rata benefit of
                  Lenders, without the necessity of prior demand or Notice from
                  Credit Agent, and Borrower authorizes Credit Agent to cause
                  the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for,
                  or reduce the Buydown by, the amount of any outstanding
                  Advance against a specific Pledged Loan upon the earliest
                  occurrence of any of the following events:

                  (1)      One (1) Business Day elapses from the date an Advance
                           was made if the Pledged Loan that was to have been
                           funded by that Advance is not closed and funded.

                  (2)      Fifteen (15) Business Days elapse without the return
                           of a Collateral Document delivered by Credit Agent to
                           Borrower under a Trust Receipt for correction or
                           completion.

                  (3)      On the date on which a Pledged Loan is determined to
                           have been originated based on untrue, incomplete or
                           inaccurate information or otherwise to be subject to
                           fraud, whether or not Borrower had knowledge of the
                           misrepresentation, incomplete or incorrect
                           information or fraud, or on the date on which
                           Borrower knows, or has reason to know, or receives
                           Notice from Credit Agent, that one or more of the
                           representations and warranties set forth in Article
                           10 were inaccurate or incomplete in any material
                           respect on any date when made or deemed made.

                  (4)      Except in the case of Foreclosure Claim Receivables
                           and Foreclosure Mortgage Loans, on the date the
                           Pledged Loan or a Lien prior to the Pledged Loan is
                           defaulted and remains in default for a period of 60
                           days or more.

                  (5)      Upon the sale, other disposition or prepayment of any
                           Pledged Asset or, with respect to a Pledged Loan
                           included in an Eligible Mortgage Pool, upon the sale
                           or other disposition of the related Agency Security.

                  (6)      One (1) Business Day immediately preceding the date
                           scheduled for the foreclosure or trustee sale of the
                           premises securing a Mortgage Loan, unless such
                           foreclosure or trustee sale will give rise to a
                           Foreclosure Claim Receivable against which the
                           related Advance may remain outstanding hereunder.

         4.3(d)   Upon telephonic Notice to Borrower by Credit Agent, Borrower
                  must pay to Credit Agent, and Borrower authorizes Credit Agent
                  to cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating
                  Account for, or reduce the Buydown, the amount of any
                  outstanding Advance against a specific Pledged Loan upon the
                  earliest occurrence of any of the following events:

                  (1)      For any Pledged Loan, the Warehouse Period elapses.

                                                                         Page 10
<PAGE>

                  (2)      Forty-five (45) days elapse from the date a Pledged
                           Loan was delivered to an Investor or Approved
                           Custodian for examination and purchase or for
                           inclusion in a Mortgage Pool, without the purchase
                           being made or an Eligible Mortgage Pool being
                           initially certified, or upon rejection of a Pledged
                           Loan as unsatisfactory by an Investor or Approved
                           Custodian.

                  (3)      Seven (7) Business Days elapse from the date a Wet
                           Settlement Advance was made against a Pledged Loan
                           without receipt by Credit Agent of all Collateral
                           Documents relating to the Pledged Loan, or the
                           Collateral Documents, upon examination by Credit
                           Agent, do not comply with the requirements of this
                           Agreement.

                  (4)      With respect to any Pledged Loan, any of the
                           Collateral Documents, upon examination by Credit
                           Agent, are found not to be in compliance with the
                           requirements of this Agreement or the related
                           Purchase Commitment, unless such non-compliance is,
                           in Credit Agent's reasonable judgement, readily
                           curable.

         4.3(e)   Borrower must pay the outstanding amount of any Overdraft
                  Advance in full within 1 Business Day after the date of the
                  Overdraft Advance.

         4.3(f)   In addition to the payments required pursuant to Sections
                  4.3(c) and 4.3(d), if the principal amount of any Pledged Loan
                  is prepaid in whole or in part while Advances are outstanding
                  against the Pledged Loan, Borrower must pay to Credit Agent,
                  without the necessity or prior demand or Notice from Credit
                  Agent, and Borrower authorizes Credit Agent to cause the
                  Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account for, the
                  amount of the prepayment, to be applied against such Advances.

         4.3(g)   The proceeds of the sale, other disposition or collection of
                  Pledged Assets must be paid directly by the Investor or other
                  Obligor to the Cash Collateral Account. Borrower must give
                  Notice to Credit Agent (by RFConnects) of the Pledged Assets
                  for which proceeds have been received. Upon receipt of
                  Borrower's Notice, Credit Agent will apply any proceeds
                  deposited into the Cash Collateral Account to the payment of
                  the Advances related to the Pledged Assets identified by
                  Borrower in its Notice, and those Pledged Assets will be
                  considered to have been redeemed from pledge. Credit Agent is
                  entitled to rely upon Borrower's affirmation that deposits in
                  the Cash Collateral Account represent payments from Investors
                  or other Obligor for the purchase of or in payment of the
                  Pledged Assets specified by Borrower in its Notice. If the
                  payment from an Investor or other Obligor for the purchase of
                  or in payment of Pledged Assets is less than the outstanding
                  Advances against the Pledged Assets identified by Borrower in
                  its Notice, Borrower authorizes Credit Agent to cause the
                  Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating Account, or to
                  charge the Buydown, in an amount equal to that deficiency. As
                  long as no Default or Event of Default exists, Credit Agent
                  will return to Borrower any excess payment from an Investor or
                  other Obligor for Pledged Assets.

         4.3(h)   Amounts received by Credit Agent as proceeds of the sale or
                  other disposition of Pledged Mortgages or Pledged Securities
                  and applicable to the principal amount of Warehousing Advances
                  and Swingline Advances, including without limitation, amounts
                  from time to time deposited in the Cash Collateral Account,
                  shall be allocated among Lenders as follows:

                  (1)      First, to RFC until the principal amount of the
                           Swingline Advances have been paid in full; and

                  (2)      Second, pro rata to Lenders in accordance with their
                           respective Percentage Shares, for application to the
                           Warehousing Advances.

                                                                         Page 11
<PAGE>

                  Amounts applied to the Swingline Advances as set forth above
                  shall, unless the Advances outstanding against such Pledged
                  Mortgages or Pledged Securities were Swingline Advances, shall
                  be deemed to be (i) a repayment of the Warehousing Advances
                  outstanding against such Pledged Mortgages or Pledged
                  Securities and (ii) a refunding of the Swingline Advances
                  repaid as Warehousing Advances made by Lenders in accordance
                  with Section 1.3 hereof.

         4.3(i)   Credit Agent reserves the right to revalue any Pledged Loan
                  that is not covered by a Purchase Commitment from Fannie Mae
                  or Freddie Mac. Credit Agent reserves the right to revalue any
                  Pledged Loan that is to be exchanged for an Agency Security if
                  that Agency Security is not covered by a Purchase Commitment.
                  Credit Agent reserves the right to revalue any other Eligible
                  Asset. Borrower must pay to Credit Agent, without the
                  necessity of prior demand or Notice from Credit Agent, and
                  Borrower authorizes Credit Agent to cause the Funding Bank to
                  charge Borrower's Operating Account for, any amount required
                  after any such revaluation to reduce the principal amount of
                  the Warehousing Advances, Swingline Advance or RFC Direct
                  Advance outstanding against the revalued Eligible Asset to an
                  amount equal to the Advance Rate for the applicable Eligible
                  Asset type multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Eligible
                  Asset.

         4.3(j)   Upon the occurrence of any event described in Section 11.1(f)
                  with respect to Lennar, Borrower shall, at the request of the
                  Credit Agent or the Majority Lenders, repay all Advances
                  outstanding against Agreements for Deed, Construction/Perm
                  Mortgage Loans and Unimproved Land Loans.

         4.3(k)   Borrower may prepay a portion of the RFC Direct Advances,
                  Swingline Advances and Warehousing Advances made by RFC
                  (collectively, the "RFC Advances") outstanding under this
                  Agreement (a "Buydown"). A Buydown is a reduction in the
                  aggregate amount of the RFC Advances outstanding under this
                  Agreement, but does not represent the prepayment of any
                  particular RFC Advance, and does not entitle Borrower to the
                  release of any Collateral. Unless a Default or Event of
                  Default exists, all or any portion of a Buydown may be
                  reborrowed upon Notice to Credit Agent not later than 3:30
                  p.m. on the Business Day that Borrower desires to reborrow
                  such amount. If Credit Agent receives a payment of Advances
                  that would, as a result of Buydowns by Borrower, reduce the
                  outstanding principal balance of the RFC Advances to an amount
                  less than zero, the Buydowns, or a portion of the Buydowns
                  equal to such excess, will be re-advanced to Borrower. RFC may
                  apply Buydowns to reduce interest payable by Borrower on
                  outstanding RFC Advances in any order that Lender determines
                  in its sole discretion. Upon application by RFC of any Buydown
                  to RFC's Warehousing Advances, RFC shall be deemed to have
                  purchased from each Lender an undivided participation interest
                  in such Lender's outstanding Warehousing Advances in an amount
                  equal to such Lender's Percentage Share of the amount so
                  applied. The Lenders may at any time, in their sole and
                  absolute discretion request RFC to make Warehousing Advances
                  in a principal amount equal to the amount so applied. RFC's
                  Warehousing Advances made pursuant to the preceding sentences
                  shall be delivered directly to the Lenders, in their
                  respective Percentage Shares, and shall be promptly applied by
                  each Lender against its outstanding Warehousing Advances.

         4.3(l)   In addition to the payments required pursuant to Sections
                  4.3(a) - 4.3(j), Borrower shall repay the Warehousing
                  Advances, RFC Direct Advances and Swingline Advances as set
                  forth in Exhibit H.


4.4.     Agent's Fees

         Borrower shall pay to Credit Agent, for its own account, such fees as
         shall be separately agreed between Borrower and Credit Agent.

                                                                         Page 12
<PAGE>

4.5.     Commitment Fees

         To each Lender, through Credit Agent, a non-refundable Commitment Fee
         in an amount equal to the percentage set forth below of such Lender's
         Warehousing Commitment Amount (plus, in the case of RFC, the RFC Direct
         Commitment Amount), based on the amount and tenor of such Lender's
         Warehousing Commitment (plus, in the case of RFC, the RFC Direct
         Commitment), for the period from the Closing Date through the
         applicable Maturity Date, payable on the Closing Date, calculated as
         follows:

<TABLE>

         May 31, 2002              $20,000,000 to $45,000,000           .02%

         May 31, 2002              $50,000,000 or more                  .10%

         May 31, 2003              $20,000,000 to $45,000,000           .035%

         May 31, 2003              $50,000,000 or more                  .10%
</TABLE>

         If any Lender increases its Warehousing Commitment Amount, if the
         Warehousing Credit Limit is increased by an Additional Lender becoming
         a party hereto, or if RFC increases the RFC Direct Commitment Amount,
         Borrower shall pay the prorated portion of the applicable Commitment
         Fee on the amount of such increase or the amount of such Additional
         Lender's Warehousing Commitment Amount from the effective date thereof
         to the applicable Maturity Date. If, at any time, the Maturity Date of
         any Commitment is extended, Borrower shall pay an additional Commitment
         Fee in the prorated amount determined pursuant to the above calculation
         of the extended Commitment Amount from the day after the original
         Maturity Date to the extended Maturity Date. Borrower shall not be
         entitled to a reduction in the amount of the Commitment Fee in the
         event the amount of any Lender's Warehousing Commitment is reduced at
         the request of Borrower, or in the event that any Lender's Warehousing
         Commitment is terminated prior to its stated expiration date as a
         result of an Event of Default hereunder.


4.6.     Miscellaneous Charges

         Borrower must reimburse Credit Agent for all Miscellaneous Charges.
         Miscellaneous Charges are due when incurred, but will not be considered
         delinquent if Borrower pays them within 10 days after the date of
         Credit Agent's invoice or account analysis statement.


4.7.     Method of Making Payments

         4.7(a)   Credit Agent shall, on or before the 5th Business Day of each
                  month, deliver to Borrower billings for interest due and
                  payable on Advances, Agent's Fees, Miscellaneous Charges and
                  other fees and charges calculated through the end of the
                  preceding month. On or before the 10th Business Day of each
                  month, Borrower shall pay to Credit Agent the full amount of
                  interest, fees and charges billed as described above.

         4.7(b)   All payments made on account of the Obligations shall be made
                  by Borrower to Credit Agent for distribution to Lenders,
                  except for Balance Deficiency Fees, which shall be made
                  directly to the applicable Lender, and fees and charges
                  payable to Credit Agent for its own account. All payments made
                  on account of the Obligations shall be made without setoff or
                  counterclaim, free and clear of and without deduction for any
                  taxes, fees or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed
                  by any taxing authority, and must be received by Credit Agent
                  by 4:00 p.m. on the day of payment, it being expressly agreed
                  and

                                                                         Page 13
<PAGE>

                  understood that if a payment is received after 4:00 p.m. by
                  Credit Agent such payment will be considered to have been made
                  on the next succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall
                  be payable by Borrower at the then applicable rate during such
                  extension. No principal payments resulting from the sale of
                  Pledged Mortgages or Pledged Securities shall be deemed to
                  have been received by Credit Agent until Credit Agent has also
                  received the Notice required under Section 4.3(g). All
                  payments shall be made in lawful money of the United States of
                  America in immediately available funds transferred via wire to
                  the Cash Collateral Account. If any payment required to be
                  made by Borrower hereunder becomes due and payable on a day
                  other than a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be
                  extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest
                  shall be payable on Advances so extended at the then
                  applicable rate during such extension.

         4.7(c)   All amounts received by Credit Agent on account of the
                  Obligations (except amounts received in respect of fees,
                  Miscellaneous Charges or expenses payable hereunder to Credit
                  Agent for its own account or amounts payable to RFC for RFC
                  Direct Advances or Swingline Advances) shall be disbursed to
                  Lenders by wire transfer by 12:00 noon on the Business Day
                  after the date of receipt.

         4.7(d)   Without limiting any other right that Credit Agent or any
                  Lender may have under applicable law or otherwise, while a
                  Default or Event of Default exists, Borrower authorizes Credit
                  Agent to cause the Funding Bank to charge Borrower's Operating
                  Account for any Obligations due and owing, without the
                  necessity of prior demand or Notice from Credit Agent.


4.8.     Illegality

         In the event that any Lender shall have determined (which determination
         shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) at any time that
         the introduction of, or any change in, any applicable law, rule,
         regulation, order or decree or in the interpretation or the
         administration thereof by any Person charged with the interpretation or
         administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender with any request
         or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
         Person, shall make it unlawful or impossible for such Lender to charge
         interest at the Balance Funded Rate based on Borrower's Eligible
         Balances as contemplated by this Agreement, then such Lender shall
         forthwith give Notice thereof to Credit Agent and Borrower describing
         such illegality in reasonable detail. Upon the giving of such Notice,
         the obligation of such Lender to charge interest at the Balance Funded
         Rate based on Borrower's Eligible Balances shall be immediately
         suspended for the duration of such illegality and with respect to
         Advances bearing interest at the Balance Funded Rate, each such Advance
         of such Lender shall bear interest at the applicable Interest Rate
         described in Exhibit H. If and when such illegality ceases to exist,
         such Lender shall notify Credit Agent and Borrower thereof and such
         suspension shall cease.


4.9.     Increased Costs; Capital Requirements

         In the event any applicable law, order, regulation or directive issued
         by any governmental or monetary authority, or any change therein or in
         the governmental or judicial interpretation or application thereof, or
         compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not
         having the force of law) by any governmental or monetary authority:

         4.9(a)   Does or shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind
                  whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Advances made
                  hereunder, or change the basis of taxation on payments to such
                  Lender of principal, fees, interest or any other amount
                  payable hereunder (except for change in the rate of tax on the
                  overall gross or net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction
                  in which such Lender's principal office is located);

                                                                         Page 14
<PAGE>

         4.9(b)   Does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
                  capital requirement, special deposit, compulsory loan or
                  similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or
                  other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans
                  by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of
                  funds by, such Lender which are not otherwise included in the
                  determination of the interest rate as calculated hereunder;

         and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
         Lender of making, renewing or maintaining any Advance or to reduce any
         amount receivable in respect thereof or to reduce the rate of return on
         the capital of such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender as it
         relates to credit facilities in the nature of that evidenced by this
         Agreement, then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay any
         additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such
         additional cost or reduced amounts receivable or reduced rate of return
         as determined by such Lender with respect to this Agreement or Advances
         made hereunder. If a Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional
         amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall notify Borrower through
         Credit Agent of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled
         and Borrower shall pay such amount within 15 days thereafter. A
         certificate as to any additional amount payable pursuant to the
         foregoing sentence containing the calculation thereof in reasonable
         detail submitted by a Lender, through Credit Agent, to Borrower shall
         be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

5.2.     Release of Security Interest in Pledged Loans and Pledged Securities

         5.2(a)   Except as provided in Section 5.2(b), Pledged Loans will be
                  released from Credit Agent's security interest only against
                  payment of the Release Amount in connection with those Pledged

                  Release Amount in connection with those Pledged Agreements for
                  Deed. If Pledged Loans are transferred to a pool custodian or
                  an investor for inclusion in a Mortgage Pool and Credit
                  Agent's security interest in the Pledged Loans included in the
                  Mortgage Pool is not released before the issuance of the
                  related Mortgage-backed Security, then that Mortgage-backed
                  Security, when issued, is

                                                                         Page 17
<PAGE>

                  a Pledged Security. Credit Agent's security interest continues
                  in the Pledged Loans backing that Pledged Security and Credit
                  Agent is entitled to possession of the Pledged Security in the
                  manner provided in this Agreement.

         5.2(b)   If Pledged Loans are transferred to an Approved Custodian and
                  included in an Eligible Mortgage Pool, Credit Agent's security
                  interest in the Pledged Loans included in the Eligible
                  Mortgage Pool will be released upon the delivery of the Agency
                  Security (including delivery to or registration in the name of
                  a third party on behalf of Credit Agent), and that Agency
                  Security is a Pledged Security. Credit Agent's security
                  interest in that Pledged Security will be released only
                  against payment to Credit Agent of the Release Amount in
                  connection with the Mortgage Loans backing that Pledged
                  Security.

         5.2(c)   Credit Agent has the exclusive right to possession of all
                  Pledged Securities or, if Pledged Securities are issued in
                  book-entry form or issued in certificated form and delivered
                  to a clearing corporation (as such term is defined in the
                  Uniform Commercial Code of Minnesota) or its nominee, Credit
                  Agent has the right to have the Pledged Securities registered
                  in the name of a securities intermediary (as such term is
                  defined in the Uniform Commercial Code of Minnesota) in an
                  account containing only customer securities and credited to an
                  account of Credit Agent. Credit Agent has no duty or
                  obligation to deliver Pledged Securities to an Investor or to
                  credit Pledged Securities to the account of an Investor or the
                  Investor's designee except against payment for those Pledged
                  Securities. Borrower acknowledges that Credit Agent may enter
                  into one or more standing arrangements with securities
                  intermediaries with respect to Pledged Securities issued in
                  book entry form or issued in certificated form and delivered
                  to a clearing corporation or its designee, under which the
                  Pledged Securities are registered in the name of the
                  securities intermediary, and Borrower agrees, upon request of
                  Credit Agent, to execute and deliver to those securities
                  intermediaries Borrower's written concurrence in any such
                  standing arrangements.

         5.2(d)   If no Default or Event of Default occurs, Borrower may redeem
                  a Pledged Loan, a Pledged Agreement for Deed or Pledged
                  Security from Credit Agent's security interest by notifying
                  Credit Agent of its intention to redeem the Pledged Loan, a
                  Pledged Agreement for Deed or Pledged Security from pledge and
                  either (1) paying, or causing an Investor to pay, to Credit
                  Agent, for application to prepayment on the principal balance
                  of the Advances, the Release Amount in connection with the
                  Pledged Loan, the Pledged Agreements for Deed or the Pledged
                  Loans backing that Pledged Security, or (2) delivering
                  substitute Collateral that, in addition to being acceptable to
                  Credit Agent in its sole discretion will, when included with
                  the remaining Collateral, result in a Fair Market Value of all
                  Eligible Assets held by Credit Agent that is at least equal to
                  the aggregate outstanding Swingline Advances, Warehousing
                  Advances and RFC Direct Advances.

         5.2(e)   After a Default or Event of Default occurs, Credit Agent may,
                  with no liability to Borrower, any Lender or any Person,
                  continue to release its security interest in any Pledged Loan,
                  Pledged Agreement for Deed or Pledged Security against payment
                  of the Release Amount in connection with that Pledged Loan,
                  the Pledged Agreements for Deed or the Pledged Loans backing
                  that Pledged Security.

         5.2(f)   The amount ("Release Amount") to be paid by Borrower to obtain
                  the release of Credit Agent's security interest in a Pledged
                  Loan or Pledged Agreement for Deed will be (a) the payment

5.3.     Collection and Servicing Rights

         All proceeds of any Purchase Commitment or any other sale of
         Collateral, and all amounts paid on any Receivable, shall be paid
         directly to the Cash Collateral Account, for application as provided in
         this Agreement. If no Event of Default exists, Borrower may service and
         receive and collect directly all other sums payable in respect of the
         Collateral.

         After an Event of Default, Credit Agent or its designee are entitled to
         service and receive and collect all sums payable to Borrower in respect
         of the Collateral, and in such case (1) Credit Agent or its designee in
         its discretion may, in its own name, in the name of Borrower or
         otherwise, demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at
         any time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of
         the Collateral, but Credit Agent has no obligation to do so, (2)
         Borrower must, if Credit Agent requests it to do so, hold in trust for
         the benefit of Credit Agent and immediately pay to Credit Agent at its
         office designated by Notice, all amounts received by Borrower upon or
         in respect of any of the Collateral, advising Credit Agent as to the
         source of such funds and (3) all amounts so received and collected by
         Credit Agent will be held by it as part of the Collateral.


5.4.     Return of Collateral at End of Warehousing Commitment

         If (a) the Warehousing Commitment has expired or been terminated, and
         (b) no Advances, interest or other Obligations are outstanding and
         unpaid, Credit Agent will release its security interest and deliver all
         Collateral in its possession to Borrower at Borrower's expense.
         Borrower's acknowledgement or receipt for any Collateral released or
         delivered to Borrower under any provision of this Agreement is a
         complete and full acquittance for the Collateral so returned, and
         Credit Agent is discharged from any liability or responsibility for
         that Collateral.


5.5.     Delivery of Collateral Documents

         5.5(a)   Credit Agent may deliver documents relating to the Collateral

                  Receipt.

         5.5(b)   If no Default or Event of Default exists, upon delivery by
                  Borrower to Credit Agent of shipping instructions by
                  RFConnects on the Business Day prior to transmission, Credit
                  Agent will transmit Pledged Loans, Pledged Agreements for Deed
                  or Pledged Securities, together with all related loan
                  documents and pool documents in Credit Agent's possession, to
                  the applicable Investor, Approved Custodian or other party
                  acceptable to Credit Agent in its sole discretion.

         5.5(c)   If a Default or Event of Default exists, Credit Agent may,
                  without liability to Borrower or any other Person, continue to
                  transmit Pledged Loans, Pledged Agreements for Deed or Pledged
                  Securities, together with all related loan documents and pool
                  documents in Credit Agent's possession, to the applicable
                  Investor, Approved Custodian or other party acceptable to
                  Credit Agent in its sole discretion.

         5.5(d)   Upon receipt of Notice from Borrower under Section 4.3(g), and
                  payment of the Release Amount with respect to a Pledged Asset
                  identified by Borrower, Credit Agent will, at Borrower's
                  request, release to Borrower any Collateral Documents relating
                  to the redeemed Pledged Asset or the Pledged Loans backing a
                  Pledged Security that Credit Agent has in its possession and
                  that have not been delivered to an Investor or Approved
                  Custodian; provided, that Credit Agent shall, if requested by
                  an Investor or Approved Custodian or consistent with past
                  practices, provide the Collateral Documents for any Pledged
                  Asset purchased to such Investor, and the Collateral Documents
                  for any Pledged Loan backing Mortgage-backed Securities to the
                  Approved Custodian.

                                                                         Page 19

5.6.     Borrower Remains Liable

         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower shall remain
         liable under each item of the Collateral to observe and perform all the
         conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it
         thereunder, all in accordance with the terms thereof and any other
         agreement giving rise thereto, and in accordance with and pursuant to
         the terms and provisions thereof. Whether or not Credit Agent has
         exercised any rights in any of the Collateral, neither Credit Agent nor
         any Lender shall have any obligation or liability under any of the
         Collateral (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or
         arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by Credit Agent of any
         payment relating thereto, nor shall Credit Agent nor any Lender be
         obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of Borrower
         under or pursuant to any of the Collateral (or any agreement giving
         rise thereto) to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature
         or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the
         sufficiency of any performance by any party under any of the Collateral
         (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to present or file any claim,
         to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment
         of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be
         entitled at any time or times.


5.7.     Further Assurance

         Borrower agrees to execute such financing statements and to take
         whatever other actions are reasonably requested by Credit Agent
         (including, without limitation, amending this Agreement to take account
         of the adoption of Revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code) to
         perfect and continue Credit Agent's security interest in the
         Collateral, and authorizes Credit Agent to file financing statements
         (including financing statements containing a broader description of the
         Collateral than the description set forth herein). Borrower will
         execute and cooperate with Credit Agent in obtaining from third parties
         Control Agreements in form satisfactory to Credit Agent with respect to
         collateral consisting of investment property, deposit accounts,
         letter-of-credit rights, and electronic chattel paper.

         any arbitrator or before any government commission, board, bureau or
         other administrative agency that, if adversely determined, may
         reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change in
         Borrower's business, operations, assets or financial condition as a

         body or authority that could result in a material adverse change in any
         Borrower's business, operations, assets or financial condition as a

         Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document.

         7.6, except for those properties and assets that Borrower has disposed
         of since the date of those financial statements either in the ordinary
         course of business or because they were no longer used or useful in the
         conduct of Borrower's or the Subsidiary's business. All of Borrower's
         properties and assets are free and clear of all Liens except as
         disclosed in each Borrower's respective financial statements.

         Each Plan is in compliance with all applicable requirements of ERISA
         and the Internal Revenue Code and with all material applicable rulings
         and regulations issued under the provisions of ERISA and the Internal
         Revenue Code setting forth those requirements, except where any failure
         to comply would not result in a material loss to any Borrower or any
         ERISA Affiliate. All of the minimum funding standards or other
         contribution obligations applicable to each Plan have been satisfied.
         No Plan is a defined-benefit pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
         and there is no Multiemployer Plan.

         10.6 (a) Borrower is the legal and equitable owner and holder, free and
                  clear of all Liens (other than Liens granted hereunder) of the

                  to be subject to a security interest in favor of the Credit

                  thereof.

                                                                         Page 43

         10.6 (d) To the best of Borrower's knowledge, with respect to any
                  Receivables, the mortgagor who is liable for payments that
                  will be applicable to such Receivables, or Fannie Mae, Freddie
                  Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA or the private mortgage insurer,
                  obligated thereon, has no defense, setoff, claim or
                  counterclaim against Borrower which can be asserted against
                  the Credit Agent, whether in any proceeding to enforce the
                  Credit Agent's security interest in such Receivable or

                  required, no consent of any Person is required for the grant
                  of a security interest in the Receivables to the Credit Agent,
                  and no consent will need to be obtained upon the occurrence of
                  an Event of Default for the Credit Agent to exercise its
                  rights with respect to any of the Receivables.

10.7.    Special Representations Concerning Pledged Shares.

         The Borrowers hereby represent and warrant to the Lenders, as of the

         10.7 (a) UAMC has title to the Pledged Shares and will have title to
                  all further Pledged Shares hereafter issued, free of all Liens

         10.7 (b) UAMC has full power and authority to subject the Pledged
                  Shares to the security interest created hereby.

                  Shares is on file in any public office (except for any

         10.7 (d) The Pledged Shares have been duly authorized and validly
                  issued by UAMC Asset and are fully paid and non-assessable.
                  The certificates representing the Pledged Shares are genuine.
                  The Pledged Shares are not subject to any offset or similar
                  right or claim of the issuers thereof.

         10.7 (e) The Pledged Shares constitute 100% of the issued and

                  voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged
                  Shares for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this
                  Agreement; provided, however, that UAMC shall not exercise or
                  refrain from exercising any such right if such action could
                  reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
                  the value of the Collateral or any material part thereof.

         10.8 (b) Any and all dividends paid in respect of the Pledged Shares
                  after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default
                  or Event of Default shall be forthwith delivered to the Credit
                  Agent to hold as Collateral and shall, if received by any
                  Borrower, be received in trust for the benefit of the Lenders,
                  be segregated from the other property or funds of Borrowers,
                  and be forthwith delivered to the Credit Agent as Collateral
                  in the same form as so received (with any necessary
                  endorsement or assignment). Each Borrower shall, upon request
                  by the Lender, promptly execute all such documents and do all
                  such acts as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to
                  the provisions of this Section 10.8(b).

         10.8 (c) The Credit Agent shall execute and deliver (or cause to be
                  executed and delivered) to

                                                                         Page 44
<PAGE>

                  UAMC all such proxies and other instruments as UAMC may
                  reasonable request for the purpose of enabling UAMC to
                  exercise the voting and other rights that it is entitled to
                  exercise pursuant to Section 10.8(a) hereof and to receive the
                  dividends that it is authorized to receive and retain pursuant
                  to Section 10.8(b) hereof.

         10.8 (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
                  Default, the Credit Agent shall have the right in its sole
                  discretion, and Borrowers shall execute and deliver all such
                  proxies and other instruments as may be necessary or
                  appropriate to give effect to such right, to terminate all
                  rights of Borrowers to exercise or refrain from exercising the
                  voting and other consensual rights that it would otherwise be
                  entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 10.8(a) hereof, and
                  all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Credit
                  Agent who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise or
                  refrain from exercising such voting and other consensual
                  rights; provided, however, that the Credit Agent and the
                  Lenders shall not be deemed to possess or have control over
                  any voting rights with respect to any Collateral unless and
                  until the Credit Agent has given written notice to Borrowers
                  that any further exercise of such voting rights by Borrowers
                  is prohibited and that the Credit Agent and/or its assigns
                  will henceforth exercise such voting rights; and provided
                  further, that neither the registration of any item of
                  Collateral in the Credit Agent's name nor the exercise of any
                  voting rights with respect thereto shall be deemed to
                  constitute a retention by the Credit Agent or the Lenders of
                  any such Collateral in satisfaction of the Obligations or any
                  part thereof.

                  under Section 8.7(c) or 8.7(d); or

         11.1 (m) A material adverse change occurs in any Borrower's financial
                  condition, business, properties, operations or prospects, or

11.2.    Remedies

         11.2 (a) If a Lender shall have knowledge of a Default or an Event of
                  Default, it shall forthwith give Notice thereof to Credit
                  Agent. Credit Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
                  Notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default
                  unless Credit Agent has received Notice from a Lender or a
                  Borrower.

         11.2 (b) If an Event of Default described in Section 11.1 (f) occurs
                  with respect to any Borrower, the Commitments will
                  automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of and
                  accrued interest on the Notes and all other Obligations will
                  automatically become due and payable, without presentment,
                  demand or other requirements of any kind, all of which
                  Borrower expressly waives.

                                                                         Page 47
<PAGE>

         11.2 (c) If any other Event of Default occurs, Majority Lenders may, by
                  Notice to each Borrower, terminate the Commitments and declare
                  the Obligations to be immediately due and payable.

         11.2 (d) If any Event of Default occurs, Credit Agent, on behalf of
                  Lenders, may, and at the direction of the Majority Lenders
                  shall (subject to Section 12.3(c)), also take any of the
                  following actions:

                  (1)      Foreclose upon or otherwise enforce its security
                           interest in and Lien on the Collateral to secure all
                           payments and performance of the Obligations in any
                           manner permitted by law or provided for in the Loan
                           Documents.

                  (2)      Notify all obligors under any of the Collateral that
                           the Collateral has been assigned to Credit Agent , on

                           Credit Agent) and that all payments on that
                           Collateral are to be made directly to Credit Agent
                           (or such other Person); settle, compromise or
                           release, in whole or in part, any amounts any obligor
                           or Investor owes on any of the Collateral on terms
                           acceptable to Credit Agent; enforce payment and
                           prosecute any action or proceeding involving any of
                           the Collateral; and where any Collateral is in
                           default, foreclose on and enforce any Liens securing
                           that Collateral in any manner permitted by law and
                           sell any property acquired as a result of those
                           enforcement actions.

                  (3)      Act, or contract with a third party to act at
                           Borrower's expense, as servicer or subservicer of
                           Collateral requiring servicing and perform all
                           obligations required under any Servicing Contracts
                           and Purchase Commitments.

                  (4)      Require each Borrower to assemble and make available
                           to Credit Agent the Collateral and all related books
                           and records at a place designated by Credit Agent.

                  (5)      Enter onto property where any Collateral or related
                           books and records are located and take possession of
                           those items with or without judicial process as
                           permitted by applicable law; and obtain access to
                           each Borrower's data processing equipment, computer
                           hardware and software relating to the Collateral and
                           use all of the foregoing and the information
                           contained in the foregoing in any manner Credit Agent
                           deems necessary for the purpose of effectuating its
                           rights under this Agreement and any other Loan
                           Document.

                  (6)      Before the disposition of the Collateral, prepare it
                           for disposition in any manner and to the extent
                           Credit Agent deems appropriate.

                  (7)      Exercise all rights and remedies of a secured
                           creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code of
                           Minnesota or other applicable law, including selling
                           or otherwise disposing of all or any portion of the
                           Collateral at one or more public or private sales,
                           whether or not the Collateral is present at the place
                           of sale, for cash or credit or future delivery, on
                           the terms and in the manner as Credit Agent may
                           determine, including sale under any applicable
                           Purchase Commitment. If notice is required under
                           applicable law, Credit Agent will give Borrower not
                           less than 10 days' notice of any public sale or of
                           the date after which any private sale may be held.
                           Each Borrower agrees that 10 days' notice is
                           reasonable notice. Credit Agent may, without notice
                           or publication, adjourn any public or private sale
                           one or more times by announcement at the time and
                           place fixed for the sale, and the sale may be held at
                           any time or place announced at the adjournment. In
                           the case of a sale of all or any portion of the
                           Collateral on credit or for future delivery, the
                           Collateral sold on those terms may be may be retained
                           by Credit Agent until

                                                                         Page 48
<PAGE>

                           the purchaser pays the selling price or takes
                           possession of the Collateral. Credit Agent has no
                           liability to Borrower if a purchaser fails to pay for
                           or take possession of the Collateral sold on those
                           terms, and in the case of any such failure, Credit
                           Agent may sell the Collateral again upon notice
                           complying with this Section.

                  (8)      Instead of or in conjunction with exercising the
                           power of sale authorized by Section 11.2 (d)(7),
                           Credit Agent may proceed by suit at law or in equity
                           to collect all amounts due upon the Collateral, or to
                           foreclose Credit Agent's Lien on and sell all or any
                           portion of the Collateral pursuant to a judgment or
                           decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  (9)      Proceed against any Borrower on the Notes or against
                           Lennar under the Lennar Undertaking.

                  (10)     Retain all excess proceeds from the sale or other
                           disposition of the Collateral, and apply them to the
                           payment of the Obligations under Section 11.3.

         11.2 (e) Credit Agent shall follow the instructions of the Majority
                  Lenders in exercising or not exercising its rights under this
                  Section 11.2, but (i) Credit Agent shall have no obligation to
                  take or not to take any action which it believes may expose it
                  to any liability, and (ii) Credit Agent may, but shall be
                  under no obligation to, await instructions from the Majority
                  Lenders before exercising or not exercising its rights under
                  this Section 11.2.

         11.2 (f) Credit Agent or any Lender will incur no liability as a result
                  of the commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of
                  all or any portion of the Collateral at any public or private
                  sale or other disposition. Each Borrower waives (to the extent
                  permitted by law) any claims it may have against Credit Agent
                  and each other Lender arising by reason of the fact that the
                  price at which the Collateral may have been sold at a private
                  sale was less than the price that Credit Agent might have
                  obtained at a public sale, or was less than the aggregate
                  amount of the outstanding Advances, plus accrued and unpaid
                  interest on the Advances, and unpaid fees, even if Credit
                  Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the
                  Collateral to more than one offeree. Nothing set forth above
                  in this Section 11.2(f) shall be construed as purporting to
                  waive Credit Agent's obligation to dispose of Collateral in a
                  commercially reasonable manner as required under the Uniform
                  Commercial Code. Each Borrower agrees that any sale of
                  Collateral under the terms of a Purchase Commitment or under
                  the terms of the Lennar Undertaking, or any other disposition
                  of Collateral arranged by Borrower, whether before or after
                  the occurrence of an Event of Default, will be deemed to have
                  been made in a commercially reasonable manner.

         11.2 (g) Each Borrower acknowledges that Mortgage Loans are collateral
                  of a type that is the subject of widely distributed standard
                  price quotations and that Mortgage-backed Securities are
                  collateral of a type that is customarily sold on a recognized
                  market. Each Borrower waives any right it may have to prior
                  notice of the sale of Pledged Securities, and agrees that
                  Credit Agent may purchase Pledged Loans and Pledged Securities
                  at a private sale of such Collateral. Nothing set forth above
                  in this Section 11.2(g) shall be construed as purporting to
                  waive Credit Agent's obligation to dispose of Collateral in a
                  commercially reasonable manner as required under the Uniform
                  Commercial Code.

         11.2 (h) Each Borrower specifically waives and releases (to the extent
                  permitted by law) any equity or right of redemption, stay or
                  appraisal that Borrower has or may have under any rule of law
                  or statute now existing or adopted after the date of this
                  Agreement, and any right to require Credit Agent to (1)
                  proceed against any Person, (2) proceed against or exhaust any
                  of the Collateral or pursue its rights and remedies against
                  the Collateral in any particular order, or (3) pursue any
                  other remedy within its power. Credit Agent is not

                                                                         Page 49
<PAGE>

                  required to take any action to preserve any rights of any
                  Borrower against holders of mortgages having priority to the
                  Lien of any Mortgage included in the Collateral or to preserve
                  Borrower's rights against other prior parties.

         11.2 (i) Credit Agent may, but is not obligated to, advance any sums or
                  do any act or thing necessary to uphold or enforce the Lien
                  and priority of, or the security intended to be afforded by,
                  any Mortgage included in the Collateral, including payment of
                  delinquent taxes or assessments and insurance premiums. All
                  advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable
                  attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by Credit
                  Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy
                  conferred by this Agreement, or in the enforcement of this
                  Agreement, together with interest on those amounts at the
                  Default Rate, from the time paid by Credit Agent until repaid
                  by Borrower, are deemed to be principal outstanding under this
                  Agreement and the Notes.

         11.2 (j) No failure or delay on the part of Credit Agent to exercise
                  any right, power or remedy provided in this Agreement or under
                  any other Loan Document, at law or in equity, will operate as
                  a waiver of that right, power or remedy. No single or partial
                  exercise by Credit Agent or any Lender of any right, power or
                  remedy provided under this Agreement or any other Loan
                  Document, at law or in equity, precludes any other or further
                  exercise of that right, power, or remedy by Credit Agent or
                  any Lender, or Credit Agent's exercise of any other right,
                  power or remedy. Without limiting the foregoing, each Borrower
                  waives all defenses based on the statute of limitations to the
                  extent permitted by law. The remedies provided in this
                  Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are
                  not exclusive of any remedies provided at law or in equity.

         11.2 (k) Credit Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to
                  use, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default ,without
                  charge, each Borrower's computer programs, other programs,
                  labels, patents, copyrights, rights of use of any name,
                  Investor lists, trade names, trademarks, service marks and
                  advertising matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it
                  pertains to the Collateral, in advertising for sale and
                  selling any Collateral, and each Borrower's rights under all
                  licenses and all other agreements related to the foregoing
                  inure to Lenders' benefit until the Obligations are paid in
                  full.

11.3.    Application of Proceeds

         The proceeds of any sale, disposition or other enforcement of Credit

11.4.    Credit Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact

         Each Borrower appoints Credit Agent its attorney-in-fact, with full
         power of substitution, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions
         of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents and taking
         any action and executing any instruments that Credit Agent deems
         necessary or advisable to accomplish that purpose. Each Borrower's
         appointment of Credit Agent as attorney-in-fact is irrevocable and
         coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, Credit Agent may give notice of Credit Agent's Lien on the
         Collateral to any Person, either in the name of Borrower or in its own
         name, endorse all Pledged Loans or

                                                                         Page 51
<PAGE>

         Pledged Securities payable to the order of Borrower, change or cause to
         be changed the book-entry registration or name of subscriber or
         Investor on any Pledged Security, or receive, endorse and collect all
         checks made payable to the order of Borrower representing payment on
         account of the principal of or interest on, or the proceeds of sale of,
         any of the Pledged Loans or Pledged Securities and give full discharge
         for those transactions.

11.5.    Right of Set-Off

         Without limiting any other right that Credit Agent or any Lender may
         have under applicable law or otherwise, if any Borrower defaults in the
         payment of any Obligation or in the performance of any of its duties
         under the Loan Documents, each Lender may, without Notice to or demand
         on Borrower (which Notice or demand each Borrower expressly waives),
         set-off, appropriate or apply any and all property of Borrower held at
         any time by such Lender, or any indebtedness at any time owed by such
         Lender to or for the account of Borrower, against the Obligations,
         whether or not those Obligations have matured.

11.6.    Sharing of Payments

         If upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and acceleration of the
         Obligations, if any Lender shall hold or receive and retain any
         payment, whether by setoff, application of deposit balance or security,
         or otherwise, in respect of the Obligations, then such Lender shall
         purchase from the other Lenders for cash and at face value and without
         recourse, such participation in the Obligations held by them as shall
         be necessary to cause such payment to be shared ratably with each of
         them; provided, that if such payment or part thereof is thereafter
         recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the
         other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price
         restored as to the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but
         without interest thereon unless the purchasing Lender is required to
         pay interest on such amounts to the Person recovering such payment, in
         which case with interest thereon, computed at the same rate, and on the
         same basis, as the interest that the purchasing Lender is required to
         pay. If any Lender receives a payment from any Borrower not in respect
         of the Obligations, but relating to another relationship of such Lender
         and Borrower, such Lender may apply the payment first to the
         indebtedness arising out of the other relationship and then against the
         Obligations as provided for above.

                                                                         Page 52

12.      AGENT

12.1.    Appointment

         Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Credit Agent as
         the agent of such Lender under the Loan Documents and each such Lender
         hereby irrevocably authorizes Credit Agent to take such action on its
         behalf under the provisions of the Loan Documents and to exercise such
         powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to Credit
         Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such other
         powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Credit Agent hereby
         accepts such appointment and agrees to act in accordance with this
         Agreement.

12.2.    Duties of Agent

         12.2 (a) The provisions of the Loan Documents set forth the exclusive
                  duties of Credit Agent and no implied duties or obligations
                  shall be read into the Loan Documents against Credit Agent.
                  Credit Agent shall not be bound in any way by any agreement or
                  contract other than the Loan Documents and any other agreement
                  to which it is a party. Credit Agent shall act as an
                  independent contractor in performing its obligations as Credit
                  Agent under the Loan Documents and nothing herein contained
                  shall be deemed to create any fiduciary relationship among or
                  between Credit Agent, Borrower or Lenders.

         12.2 (b) Credit Agent shall examine the Pledged Loans delivered by or
                  on behalf of Borrower hereunder to determine whether the
                  Pledged Loans: (i) include the documents and instruments to be
                  delivered for each Pledged Loan required pursuant to Section
                  3.1, (ii) conforms with the requirements of this Agreement,
                  and (iii) is otherwise in conformity with any customary
                  collateral review criteria which Credit Agent may communicate
                  to Borrower from time to time. If Credit Agent shall have
                  determined that any Mortgage Loan delivered to Credit Agent
                  does not meet the requirements of this Agreement or the Credit
                  Agreement, Credit Agent may return to Borrower all Collateral
                  Documents relating thereto.

         12.2 (c) As to any Pledged Loan against which Advances may be made
                  pursuant to this Agreement, if Credit Agent shall note any
                  minor discrepancies or deficiencies in any Collateral
                  Documents pertaining thereto, Credit Agent shall: (a)
                  immediately notify Borrower thereof, (b) if such discrepancies
                  or deficiencies can be cured without returning any Collateral
                  Documents to Borrower, request that Borrower cure such
                  discrepancies or deficiencies immediately, and (c) if such
                  discrepancies or deficiencies can only be cured by returning
                  Collateral Documents to Borrower, return any Collateral
                  Documents containing any discrepancy or deficiency to Borrower
                  for correction against a Trust Receipt pursuant to Section
                  5.5(a) hereof.

12.3.    Standard of Care

         Credit Agent shall act in accordance with customary standards for those
         engaged as credit agents or collateral agents of commercial
         transactions in similar capacities.

         12.3 (a) Credit Agent shall not be required to ascertain or inquire as
                  to the performance or observance of any of the conditions or
                  agreements to be performed or observed by any other party,
                  except as specifically provided in the Loan Documents. Credit
                  Agent disclaims any responsibility for the validity or
                  accuracy of the recitals to the Loan

                                                                         Page 53
<PAGE>

                  Documents and any representations and warranties contained
                  herein, unless specifically identified as recitals,
                  representations or warranties of Credit Agent.

         12.3 (b) The Credit shall not have any responsibility for ascertaining
                  the value, collectibility, insurability, enforceability,
                  effectiveness or suitability of any Collateral, the title of
                  any party therein, the validity or adequacy of the security
                  afforded thereby, or the validity of the Loan Documents
                  (except as to its authority to enter into the Loan Documents
                  and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder).

         12.3 (c) No provision of this Agreement shall require Credit Agent to
                  expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
                  liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or
                  in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if, in its
                  sole judgment, it shall believe that repayment of such funds
                  or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not
                  assured to it.

         12.3 (d) Credit Agent is not responsible for preparing or filing any
                  reports or returns relating to federal, state or local income
                  taxes with respect to this Agreement, other than for its
                  compensation or for reimbursement of expenses.

12.4.    Delegation of Duties

         Credit Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by
         or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice
         of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Credit
         Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
         agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

12.5.    Exculpatory Provisions

         Credit Agent or any of its respective officers, directors, employees,
         agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall not be (a) liable for any
         action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under
         or in connection with the Loan Documents (except for its or such
         Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b)
         responsible in any manner to any of Lenders for any recitals,
         statements, representations or warranties made by each Borrower or any
         officer thereof contained in the Loan Documents or in any certificate,
         report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or
         received by Credit Agent under or in connection with, the Loan
         Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
         enforceability or sufficiency of the Loan Documents or for any failure
         of any Borrower to perform its obligations under any Loan Document.
         Credit Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
         ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of
         the agreements contained in, or conditions of, the Loan Documents or to
         inspect the properties, books or records of each Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries.

12.6.    Reliance by Agent

         Credit Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
         relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
         certification, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex
         or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
         reasonably believed by it to be correct and to have been signed, sent
         or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements
         of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to Borrower),
         independent accountants (including, without limitation, accountants to
         Borrower) and other experts selected by Credit Agent. Credit Agent may
         deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all
         purposes. As to Lenders (a) Credit Agent shall be fully justified in
         failing or refusing to take any action under the Loan Documents unless
         it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority
         Lenders or all of Lenders, as appropriate, or it shall first be

                                                                         Page 54
<PAGE>

         indemnified to its satisfaction by Lenders ratably in accordance with
         their respective Percentage Shares against any and all liability and
         expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing
         to take any action (except for liabilities and expenses resulting from
         Credit Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct), (b) Credit
         Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
         from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with a request of
         the Majority Lenders or all of Lenders, as appropriate, and such
         request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
         be binding upon all Lenders, (c) Credit Agent shall be fully justified
         in failing or refusing to take any action under the Loan Documents
         unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of Credit
         Agent, and (d) Credit Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
         acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in
         accordance with a request of or instructions from Credit Agent, and
         such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
         shall be binding upon all Lenders.

12.7.    Non-Reliance on Agent or Other Lenders

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges that Credit Agent, nor any of their
         respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
         Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to such Lender
         and that no act by Credit Agent hereafter taken, including any review
         of the affairs of each Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any
         representation or warranty by Credit Agent to any Lender. Each Lender
         represents to Credit Agent that it has, independently and without
         reliance upon Credit Agent or any other Lender, and based on such
         documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
         appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
         financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each Borrower and
         made its own decision to enter into and make Advances under the Credit
         Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
         without reliance upon Credit Agent or any other Lender, and based on
         such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
         time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and
         decisions in taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement,
         and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself
         as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition
         and creditworthiness of each Borrower. Except for notices, reports and
         other documents expressly required to be furnished to Lenders by Credit
         Agent hereunder, Credit Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to
         provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the
         business, operations, property, financial or other condition or
         creditworthiness of each Borrower or any Subsidiary which may come into
         the possession of Credit Agent or any of their respective officers,
         directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

12.8.    Agent in Individual Capacity

         Credit Agent may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally
         engage in any kind of business with any Borrower as though it were not
         an agent hereunder. With respect to the Advances made or renewed by
         them and any Note issued to them, Credit Agent shall have the same
         rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any Lender and may
         exercise the same as though it were not Credit Agent, and the terms
         "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include Credit Agent in its individual
         capacity.

12.9.    Successor Agent

         Credit Agent may resign as such at any time upon giving 30 days Notice
         to Borrower and Lenders. Credit Agent may be removed immediately with
         cause or at any time upon 30 days Notice from the Majority Lenders to
         Credit Agent and Borrower. Upon Notice of such resignation or removal,
         the Majority Lenders may appoint a successor Credit Agent (which
         successor Credit Agent, assuming that no Default or Event of Default
         exists, shall be reasonably acceptable to

                                                                         Page 55
<PAGE>

         Borrower). The date on which Borrower, Credit Agent and Lenders have
         received Notice from such successor of its acceptance of appointment as
         Credit Agent shall constitute the effective date of resignation or
         removal of the resigning or removed Credit Agent. If no successor
         Credit Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and
         shall have accepted such appointment within the allotted time period,
         then, upon 5 days Notice to Borrower, the resigned or removed Credit
         Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor. Upon the
         effective date of resignation or removal of the resigning or removed
         Credit Agent, such successor will thereupon succeed to and become
         vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the
         resigning or removed Credit Agent, but the resigning or removed Credit
         Agent shall not be discharged from any liability as a result of its or
         its directors', officers', agents', or employees' gross negligence or
         willful misconduct in the performance of its duties and obligations
         under this Agreement prior to the effective date of its resignation or
         removal. Upon the effective date of its resignation or removal, Credit
         Agent shall assign all of its right, title and security interest in and
         to all Collateral to its successor, without recourse, warranty or
         representation, express or implied.

13.      MISCELLANEOUS

13.1.    Notices

         Except where telephonic or facsimile notice is expressly authorized by
         this Agreement, all communications required or permitted to be given or
         made under this Agreement ("Notices") must be in writing and must be
         sent by manual delivery, overnight courier or United States mail
         (postage prepaid), addressed as follows (or at such other address as
         may be designated by it in a Notice to the other):

           If to Borrower:      Universal American Mortgage Company
                                730 NW 107th Avenue, 4th Floor
                                Miami, FL 33172
                                Attention: Janice Munoz, Treasurer
                                           and Vice President

           If to Credit Agent:  Residential Funding Corporation
                                4800 Montgomery Lane, #300
                                Bethesda, MD 20814
                                Attention:  Jim Clapp, Director

           If to any Lender:    As set forth on the signature pages hereof or of
                                any amendment hereto.

         In addition, Credit Agent shall use its best efforts to provide a copy
         of any Notice of an Event of Default, or regarding the exercise of any
         of its remedies to Lennar Corporation, 700 N.W. 107th Avenue, 4th
         Floor, Miami, Florida 33172, Attention: David B. McCain, Vice President
         and General Counsel, or such other counsel as Borrower may designate,
         but failure to provide such copy shall not render any such Notice
         ineffective. All periods of Notice will be measured from the date of
         delivery if manually delivered, from the first Business Day after the
         date of sending if sent by overnight courier or from 4 days after the
         date of mailing if sent by United States mail, except that Notices to
         Credit Agent under Article 2 and Section 11.2 shall be deemed to have
         been given only when actually received. Each Borrower authorizes Credit
         Agent to accept Borrower's bailee pledge agreements, Advance Requests,
         shipping requests, wire transfer instructions and security delivery
         instructions transmitted to Credit Agent by facsimile or electronic
         transmission, and those documents, when transmitted to Credit Agent by
         facsimile or electronic transmission, have the same force and effect as
         the originals.

13.2.    Reimbursement Of Expenses; Indemnity

         Borrower must: (a) pay such documentation production fees as Credit
         Agent may require and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Credit
         Agent, including reasonable fees, service charges and disbursements of
         counsel (including allocated costs of internal counsel), in connection
         with the amendment, enforcement and administration of this Agreement,
         the Notes, and other Loan Documents and the making and repayment of the
         Advances, and the payment of interest thereon; (b) indemnify, pay, and
         hold harmless Credit Agent, and any other holder of the Notes from and
         against, all present and future stamp, documentary and other similar
         taxes with respect to the foregoing matters and save Credit Agent, and
         any other holder of the Notes harmless from and against any and all
         liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or omission to
         pay such taxes; and (c) indemnify, pay and hold harmless Credit Agent,
         each Lender, any of their officers, directors, employees or agents and
         any subsequent holder of the Notes (collectively called the
         "Indemnitees") from and against all liabilities, obligations, actual
         losses, damages, penalties, judgments, direct suits, costs, expenses
         and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including the
         reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel of the Indemnitees
         (including

                                                                         Page 57
<PAGE>

         allocated costs of internal counsel), exclusive of indirect,
         consequential and other similar losses, in connection with any
         investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not
         the Indemnitees have been designated as parties to such proceeding)
         that may be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against such
         Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
         the Notes, or any other Loan Document or any of the transactions
         contemplated hereby or thereby ("Indemnified Liabilities"), except that
         Borrower has no obligation under this Agreement to any Indemnity with
         respect to Indemnified Liabilities arising from the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. To the extent that the
         undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless as set forth in the
         preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any
         law or public policy, Borrower must contribute the maximum portion that
         it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment
         and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the
         Indemnitees or any of them. The agreement of Borrower contained in this
         Article survives the expiration or termination of this Agreement and
         the payment in full of the Notes. Attorneys' fees and disbursements
         incurred in enforcing, or on appeal from, a judgment under this
         Agreement are recoverable separately from and in addition to any other
         amount included in such judgment, and this clause is intended to be
         severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to survive
         and not be merged into such judgment.

13.3.    Indemnification by Lenders

         Lenders agree to indemnify Credit Agent in its respective capacity as
         such (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower and without limiting the
         obligation of Borrower to do so), ratably according to the respective
         amounts of their Percentage Shares, from and against any and all
         liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
         judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
         whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at any
         time following the payment of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred
         by or asserted against Credit Agent in any way relating to or arising
         out of the Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred
         to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
         or any action taken or omitted by Credit Agent under or in connection
         with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for
         the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
         damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
         disbursements resulting from Credit Agent's gross negligence or willful
         misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of
         the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. Attorneys' fees
         and disbursements incurred in enforcing, or on appeal from, a judgment
         pursuant hereto shall be recoverable separately from and in addition to
         any other amount included in such judgment, and this clause is intended
         to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to
         survive and not be merged into such judgment.

13.4.    Financial Information

         All financial statements and reports furnished to Credit Agent under
         this Agreement must be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
         basis consistent with that applied in preparing the financial
         statements as at the end of and for each Borrower's most recent fiscal
         year (except to the extent otherwise required to conform to good
         accounting practice).

13.5.    Terms Binding Upon Successors; Survival of Representations

         The terms and provisions of this Agreement are binding upon and inure
         to the benefit of each Borrower, Credit Agent, and their respective
         successors and assigns. All of Borrower's representations, warranties,
         covenants and agreements survive the making of any Advance, and remain
         effective for as long as the Commitments are outstanding or there
         remain any Obligations to be paid or performed.

                                                                         Page 58
<PAGE>

13.6.    Lenders in Individual Capacity

         Lenders and their Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
         and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrowers and/or any
         Subsidiary regardless of the capacity of Lenders hereunder. Lenders may
         disclose to the other Lenders information regarding other relationships
         which they may have with Borrower and Borrower hereby consents to these
         disclosures.

13.7.    Assignment and Participations

         This Agreement and the Obligations of each Borrower may not be assigned
         by any Borrower. Any Lender may, subject to the limitations set forth
         below, assign or transfer, in whole or in part, this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents and further may sell participations in all or any
         part of its Advances or Maximum Commitment or any other interest in the
         Obligations or any of its obligations hereunder to another Person. In
         the case of an assignment, upon notice thereof by such Lender to
         Borrower and consent of Credit Agent, the assignee shall have, to the
         extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided thereby), the same
         rights and benefits as it would have if it were a "Lender" hereunder,
         and, if the assignee has expressly assumed, for the benefit of
         Borrower, such Lender's obligations hereunder, such Lender shall be
         relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent of such assignment
         and assumption, provided that Credit Agent shall have no obligation to
         consent to there being more than a total of 10 Lenders (a Participant
         is not a Lender). In the case of a participation, the participating
         Person's (a "Participant") rights against Lender from whom it has
         purchased such participation in respect of such participation are those
         set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the
         Participant relating thereto. Such Lender shall remain solely
         responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
         Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents, whether or not such
         Lender shall remain the holder of any Note. Such Lender shall retain
         all voting rights with respect to such Note, the Advances hereunder and
         Lender's Maximum Commitment. Borrower, Credit Agent and the other
         Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
         Documents. Without limiting any Lender's exclusive right to collect and
         enforce the Obligations owed to it, Borrower agrees that each
         participation will give rise to a debtor-creditor relationship between
         Borrower and the Participant, and Borrower authorizes each Participant,
         upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to proceed directly by
         right of setoff, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any assets of
         Borrower that may be held by that Participant. Nothing contained herein
         shall in any manner or to any extent affect the right of any Lender to
         pledge or assign its Notes and interests in this Agreement to any
         Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to applicable laws or regulations, or to
         assign its Notes and its right to receive and retain payments on its
         Notes provided such Lender remains primarily and directly liable
         pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to keep, observe
         and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement. Any Lender may
         furnish any information concerning Borrower in the possession of such
         Lender from time to time to Affiliates of such Lender and to assignees
         and Participants (including prospective assignees and Participants) and
         Borrower hereby consents to the provision of such information.

13.8.    Commitment Increases

         13.8 (a) At any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, the
                  Warehousing Credit Limit may be increased either by an
                  Additional Lender establishing a Warehousing Commitment or by
                  one or more then existing Lender ("Increase Lender")
                  increasing its Warehousing Commitment Amount (each such
                  increase by either means, a "Commitment Increase"), provided
                  that no Commitment Increase shall become effective unless and
                  until (i) Borrower, Credit Agent and the Additional Lender or
                  the Increase Lender shall have executed and delivered an
                  amendment or other modification with respect to such
                  Commitment Increase, and (ii) if, after giving effect thereto,
                  the Credit Limit would exceed $500,000,000, such Commitment
                  Increase shall have been consented to by each of the

                                                                         Page 59
<PAGE>

                  other Lenders. Any such increase may be temporary or
                  permanent; provided, that the permanent Warehousing Commitment
                  amount of each Lender shall at no time be less than
                  $15,000,000. Prior to the effective date ("Effective Date") of
                  any Commitment Increase involving an Additional Lender,
                  Borrowers shall issue a promissory note to the Additional
                  Lender. Such new promissory note or notes shall constitute a
                  "Warehousing Note" for the purposes of the Loan Documents.

         13.8 (b) On the Effective Date of any Commitment Increase, Credit Agent
                  shall recompute the Percentage Share for each Lender based on
                  the new Warehousing Credit Limit which results from the
                  Commitment Increase, and within 2 Business Days, Credit Agent
                  shall request Advances from or shall direct prepayments to
                  each Lender so that the total amount of all then outstanding
                  Warehousing Advances are shared pro rata by each Lender.

         13.8 (c) On the effective date of any reduction of the Warehousing
                  Credit Limit resulting from the expiration of a temporary
                  increase in any Lender's Warehousing Commitment Amount, the
                  Credit Agent shall recompute the Percentage Share for each
                  Lender and request Warehousing Advances from and direct
                  prepayments to each Lender so that the total amount of all the
                  outstanding Advances are shared pro-rata by each Lender.

13.9.    Amendments

         This Agreement may not be amended or terms or provisions hereof waived
         unless such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by the
         Majority Lenders, Credit Agent and each Borrower; provided, however,
         that without the prior written consent of 100% of Lenders, no amendment
         or waiver shall: (1) waive or amend any term or provision of Sections
         8.4 or the definition of any type of Collateral or the provisions of
         Section 5.2 hereof, (2) reduce the principal of, or rate of interest or
         fees on, the Advances or any Lender's Commitments, (3) except as
         provided in Section 13.8, modify the Warehousing Credit Limit, (4)
         except as provided in Section 13.8, modify any Lender's Percentage
         Share of the Warehousing Credit Limit, (5) modify the definition of
         "Majority Lenders," or of the number or percentage of Lenders that are
         required to take action under the Loan Documents, (6) extend the
         Warehousing Maturity Date, (7) release any material portion of the
         Collateral, except as expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents or
         in connection with a sale of such Collateral permitted hereunder, (8)
         amend Exhibit H, or (9) amend this Section. It is expressly agreed and
         understood that the failure by the Majority Lenders to elect to
         accelerate amounts outstanding hereunder or to terminate the obligation
         of Lenders to make Advances hereunder shall not constitute an amendment
         or waiver of any term or provision of this Agreement.

13.10.   Governing Law

         This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are governed by the laws of
         the State of Minnesota, without reference to its principles of
         conflicts of laws.

13.11.   Relationship of the Parties

         This Agreement provides for the making and repayment of Advances by
         Lenders (in their capacity as lenders) and each Borrower (in its
         capacity as a borrower), for the payment of interest on those Advances
         and for the payment of certain fees by Borrower to Lenders and Credit
         Agent. The relationship between Lenders and Borrower is limited to that
         of creditor and secured party on the part of Lenders, Credit Agent and
         of borrower and debtor on the part of Borrower. The provisions of this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents for compliance with financial
         covenants and the delivery of financial statements and other operating
         reports are intended solely

                                                                         Page 60
<PAGE>

         for the benefit of Lenders to protect its interest as a creditor and
         lender. Nothing in this Agreement creates or may be construed as
         permitting or obligating any Lender to act as a financial or business
         advisor or consultant to Borrower, as permitting or obligating any
         Lender to control Borrower or to conduct Borrower's operations, as
         creating any fiduciary obligation on the part of Lenders to Borrower,
         or as creating any joint venture, agency, or other relationship between
         Lenders and Borrower other than as explicitly and specifically stated
         in the Loan Documents. Each Borrower acknowledges that it has had the
         opportunity to obtain the advice of experienced counsel of its own
         choosing in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Loan
         Documents and to obtain the advice of that counsel with respect to all
         matters contained in the Loan Documents, including the waiver of jury
         trial contained in Section 13.16. Each Borrower further acknowledges
         that it is experienced with respect to financial and credit matters and
         has made its own independent decisions to apply to Lenders for credit
         and to execute and deliver this Agreement.

13.12.   Severability

         If any provision of this Agreement is declared to be illegal or
         unenforceable in any respect, that provision is null and void and of no
         force and effect to the extent of the illegality or unenforceability,
         and does not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
         provision of the Agreement.

13.13.   Consent to Credit References

         Each Borrower consents to the disclosure of information regarding
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their relationships with Lenders to
         Persons making credit inquiries to Credit Agent. This consent is
         revocable by Borrower at any time upon Notice to Lenders as provided in
         Section 13.1.

13.14.   Counterparts

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
         which will be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute
         but one and the same instrument.

13.15.   Entire Agreement

         This Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents represent the
         final agreement among the parties with respect to their subject matter,
         and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior or contemporaneous
         oral agreements among the parties. There are no oral agreements among
         the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, the
         Notes and the other Loan Documents.

13.16.   Consent to Jurisdiction

         AT THE OPTION OF CREDIT AGENT, THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES AND THE OTHER
         LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT WITHIN THE
         STATE OF MINNESOTA. EACH BORROWER CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION AND
         VENUE OF THOSE COURTS, AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO THE JURISDICTION OR
         VENUE OF ANY OF THOSE COURTS, INCLUDING THE OBJECTION THAT VENUE IN
         THOSE COURTS IS NOT CONVENIENT. ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY
         BE COMMENCED AND INSTITUTED BY SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON EACH BORROWER BY
         FIRST CLASS REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED,
         ADDRESSED TO BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS LAST KNOWN TO CREDIT AGENT. EACH
         BORROWER'S CONSENT AND AGREEMENT UNDER THIS SECTION DOES NOT AFFECT

                                                                         Page 61
<PAGE>

         CREDIT AGENT'S RIGHT TO ACCOMPLISH SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER
         MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE
         PROCEED AGAINST ANY BORROWER IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION OR COURT. IN THE
         EVENT ANY BORROWER COMMENCES ANY ACTION IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION OR
         VENUE UNDER ANY TORT OR CONTRACT THEORY ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
         FROM THE RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
         DOCUMENTS, CREDIT AGENT AT ITS OPTION MAY HAVE THE CASE TRANSFERRED TO
         A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT WITHIN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA OR, IF A
         TRANSFER CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, MAY HAVE
         BORROWER'S ACTION DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

13.17.   Waiver of Jury Trial

         EACH BORROWER, EACH OF LENDERS AND CREDIT AGENT EACH COVENANTS AND
         AGREES NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY A
         JURY, AND FULLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY TO THE EXTENT THAT
         ANY SUCH RIGHT NOW EXISTS OR HEREAFTER ARISES. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO
         TRIAL BY JURY IS SEPARATELY GIVEN, KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, BY
