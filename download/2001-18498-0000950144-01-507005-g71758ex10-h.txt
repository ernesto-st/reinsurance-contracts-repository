                        DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING TERMS

         1.1      DEFINITIONS.

         As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings herein
specified unless the context otherwise requires. Defined terms herein shall
include in the singular number the plural and in the plural the singular:

                  "Adjusted Eurodollar Rate" means for the Interest Period for
         each Eurodollar Loan comprising part of the same borrowing (including
         conversions, extensions and renewals), a per annum interest rate equal
         to the per annum rate obtained by dividing (a) the rate of interest
         determined by the Agent to be the average (rounded upward to the

         such a multiple


<PAGE>   6

                                                                          Page 6


         of the per annum rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered to
         the Agent in the interbank eurodollar market at 11:00 a.m. (London
         time) (or as soon thereafter as is practicable), in each case two
         Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period in an amount
         substantially equal to such Eurodollar Loan comprising part of such
         borrowing (including conversions, extensions and renewals) and for a
         period equal to such Interest Period by (b) a percentage equal to 100%
         minus the Adjusted Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, if any, for such
         Interest Period. As used herein, "Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Reserve
         Percentage" for the Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan comprising
         part of the same borrowing (including conversions, extensions and
         renewals), means the percentage applicable two Business Days before the
         first day of such Interest Period under regulations issued from time to
         time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any
         successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement (including,
         without limitation, any emergency, supplemental or other marginal
         reserve requirement) for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in
         New York City with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
         including eurocurrency liabilities, as such term is defined in
         Regulation D (or with respect to any other category of liabilities
         which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
         Eurodollar Loans is determined) having a term equal to the Interest
         Period for which such Adjusted Eurodollar Reserve Percentage is
         determined.

                  "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other
         Person (i) directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under
         direct or indirect common control with such Person or (ii) directly or
         indirectly owning or holding five (5%) or more of the Capital Stock in
         such Person. For purposes of this definition, "control" when used with
         respect to any Person means the power to direct the management and
         policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the
         ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms
         "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to the
         foregoing.

                  "Agent-Related Persons" means the Agent (including any
         successor administrative agent), together with its Affiliates
         (including, in the case of Bank of America in its capacity as the

         applicable interest rate for any day for any Loan, the applicable rate
         of the Facility Fee for any day or the applicable letter of credit

         The Applicable Margin shall be determined and adjusted quarterly on the
         date (each a "Calculation Date") five Business Days after the date by
         which the Borrower is required to provide the officer's certificate in
         accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1(e) for the most recently
         ended fiscal quarter of the Borrower, provided, however, that (i) the
         initial Applicable Margins shall be based on Pricing Level III (as
         shown above) and shall remain at Pricing Level III until the first
         Calculation Date subsequent to the Closing Date and, thereafter, the
         Pricing Level shall be determined by the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as
         of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the
         Borrowers preceding the applicable Calculation Date, and (ii) if the
         Borrower fails to provide the officer's certificate to the Agent as
         required by Section 6.1(e) for the last day of the most recently ended
         fiscal quarter of the Borrower preceding the applicable Calculation
         Date, the Applicable Margin from such Calculation Date shall be based
         on Pricing Level IV until such time as an appropriate officer's
         certificate is provided, whereupon the Pricing Level shall be
         determined by the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of the last day of the
         most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Borrower preceding such
         Calculation Date. Each Applicable Margin shall be effective from one
         Calculation Date until the next Calculation Date. Any adjustment in the
         Applicable Margins shall be applicable to all existing Loans as well as
         any new Loans made or issued.

                  "Bank" means any of the Persons identified as a "Bank" on the
         signature pages hereto, and any Person which may become a Bank by way

         Revolving Loan advance, of such Bank's pro rata share thereof and of
         the other matters covered in the Notice of Borrowing.

                  (b)      Minimum Amounts. The aggregate minimum principal
         amount of each Revolving Loan advance hereunder shall be not less than
         $1,000,000 (and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof).

                  (c)      Advances. Each Bank will make its pro rata share of
         each Revolving Loan advance available to the Agent by 12:00 noon (San
         Francisco, California time) on the date specified in the Notice of
         Borrowing by deposit in U.S. dollars of immediately available funds at
         the offices of the Agent in San Francisco, California as provided in
         Exhibit 10.1 hereto, or at such other address as the Agent may
         designate in writing. All Revolving Loan advances shall be made by the
         Banks pro rata on the basis of each Bank's Commitment Percentage. No
         Bank shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other Bank in
         its obligation to make Revolving Loan advances hereunder; provided,
         however, that the failure of any Bank to fulfill its commitments
         hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank of its commitments
         hereunder. Unless the Agent shall have been notified by any Bank prior
         to the making of any such Revolving Loan advance that such Bank does
         not intend to make available to the Agent its portion of the Revolving
         Loan advance to be made on such date, the Agent may assume that such
         Bank has made such amount available to the Agent on the date of such
         Revolving Loan advance, and the Agent, in reliance upon such
         assumption, may (in its sole discretion without any obligation to do
         so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
         corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Borrower, the
         Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such
         Bank. If such Bank does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith
         upon the Agent's demand therefor, the Agent will promptly notify the
         Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding
         amount to the Agent. The Agent shall also be entitled to recover from
         such Bank or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
         corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
         corresponding amount was made available by the Agent to the Borrower to
         the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Agent, at a per
         annum rate equal to (i) if paid by such Bank, within two Business Days
         of making

                                                                         Page 22


         such corresponding amount available to the Borrower, the overnight
         Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter the Prime Rate, and (ii) if paid by
         the Borrower, the then applicable rate calculated in accordance with
         Section 2.4.

         2.3      REPAYMENT.

         The Revolving Loans hereunder shall be due and payable in full on the
Termination Date.

         2.4      INTEREST.

         Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1, Revolving Loans shall bear
interest as follows:

                  (a)      Prime Rate Loans. During such periods as Revolving
         Loans shall consist of Prime Rate Loans, at a per annum rate equal to
         sum of the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (b)      Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as the
         Revolving Loans shall consist of Eurodollar Loans, at a per annum rate
         equal to the sum of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable
         Margin.

                  (c)      Payment of Interest. Interest on Revolving Loans
         hereunder shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.

         2.5      REVOLVING NOTES.

         The Revolving Loans by each Bank shall be evidenced by a duly executed
promissory note of the Borrower to each such Bank dated as of the Closing Date
in an original principal amount equal to such Bank's Committed Amount and
substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.5.

         2.6      LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a)      Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
         each applicable Letter of Credit Bank has issued the Letters of Credit
         described on Exhibit 2.6 hereof (which Letters of Credit shall be
         deemed issued and outstanding hereunder upon the effectiveness of this
         Loan Agreement) and each Letter of Credit Bank will from time to time
         issue standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit from
         the Closing Date until the Termination Date as the Borrower may
         request, each to be in a form acceptable to the applicable Letter of
         Credit Bank (hereinafter the Letters of Credit described on Exhibit 2.6
         and the standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit
         issued on and after the Closing Date pursuant to this Section 2.6,
         together with all extensions, renewals, modifications and replacements
         thereto, shall be referred to as the "Letters of Credit"); provided,
         however, that no Letter of Credit Bank shall issue any Letter of Credit
         to the extent that immediately after the issuance of such Letter of
         Credit the sum of the outstanding principal balance of all Revolving
         Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations would exceed the then applicable
         Maximum Commitment; provided further, no Letter of

                                                                         Page 23


         Credit Bank shall issue any standby Letter of Credit to the extent that
         immediately after the issuance of such standby Letter of Credit the
         Letter of Credit Obligations relating to all standby Letters of Credit
         would exceed $10,000,000; provided further, the Letters of Credit shall
         be issued solely for the general corporate purposes of the Borrower. No
         Letter of Credit shall have a term of more than one year with the
         exception of the Letter of Credit, LC #00352663, issued by Bank One,
         N.A. (formerly known as The First National Bank of Chicago) in the
         amount of $327,500.00. No Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date
         extending beyond the Termination Date nor shall any Letter of Credit
         have payment terms which require the applicable Letter of Credit Bank
         to make a payment thereunder after the Termination Date.

                  (b)      Notice. The request for the issuance of a Letter of
         Credit shall be submitted to the applicable Letter of Credit Bank and
         the Agent at least three Business Days prior to the requested date of
         issuance. Upon the request of the applicable Letter of Credit Bank, the
         Agent shall furnish such Letter of Credit Bank with all information
         regarding the Revolving Loans which is necessary to enable the
         applicable Letter of Credit Bank to determine whether such Letter of
         Credit Bank is obligated to issue the requested Letter of Credit. Upon
         issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Agent shall promptly notify the
         Banks of the amount and terms thereof. The applicable Letter of Credit
         Bank shall notify the Agent promptly of all payments (whether at
         maturity or in advance), reimbursements, expirations, transfers and
         other activity with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit. Upon the
         request of any Bank, the Agent shall promptly notify such Bank of all
         of such payments (whether at maturity or in advance), reimbursements,
         expirations, transfers and other activity with respect to outstanding
         Letters of Credit.

                  (c)      Participations. Each Bank shall be deemed to have
         purchased, without recourse to the applicable Letter of Credit Bank, a
         participation from the applicable Letter of Credit Bank in each Letter
         of Credit issued or deemed issued hereunder, in each case in an amount
         equal to its pro rata share (based upon its Commitment Percentage) of
         the amount of such Letter of Credit. Without limiting the scope and
         nature of each Bank's participation in any Letter of Credit, to the
         extent that the applicable Letter of Credit Bank has not been
         reimbursed by the Borrower for any payment required to be made by such
         Letter of Credit Bank under any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall pay
         to the Agent for payment to such Letter of Credit Bank each Bank's pro
         rata share of such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the day of
         notification by such Letter of Credit Bank of an unreimbursed drawing
         pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2.6(d) (or on the next
         Business Day if such notification is made after 12:00 noon (San
         Francisco, California time)); provided, however, the Banks shall not be
         obligated to reimburse the Letter of Credit Bank as provided above to
         the extent that such reimbursement obligation has arisen solely on
         account of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Letter of
         Credit Bank, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
         obligation of each Bank to so reimburse each Letter of Credit Bank
         shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the
         occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or any other occurrence or
         event. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the
         obligation of the Borrower to reimburse each Letter of Credit Bank
         under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as hereinafter
         provided.

                                                                         Page 24


                  (d)      Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any
         Letter of Credit and upon the maturity of any draft or acceptance
         purchased by a Letter of Credit Bank with respect to any Letter of
         Credit, the applicable Letter of Credit Bank will promptly notify the
         Borrower and the Agent. Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify
         the applicable Letter of Credit Bank of its intent to otherwise
         reimburse such Letter of Credit Bank, the Borrower shall be deemed to
         have requested a Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing (or, in
         the case of advance purchase by a Letter of Credit Bank, in the amount
         of the draft or acceptance), the proceeds of which will be used to
         satisfy the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower to the applicable
         Letter of Credit Bank in connection with such drawing (or advance
         purchase of drafts or acceptances). The Borrower shall reimburse the
         applicable Letter of Credit Bank on the day of such drawing under any
         Letter of Credit and upon the maturity of any draft or acceptance
         purchased by such Letter of Credit Bank with respect to any Letter of
         Credit (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan obtained hereunder
         or otherwise) in same day funds as provided in the Letter of Credit
         Application. If the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the applicable
         Letter of Credit Bank as provided hereinabove, the unreimbursed amount
         of such drawing shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         Prime Rate plus 2%. The Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder
         shall be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances
         irrespective of any rights of set-off, counterclaim or defense to
         payment the Borrower may claim or have against any Letter of Credit
         Bank, the Agent, the Banks, the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or
         any other Person, including without limitation any defense based on any
         failure of the Borrower to receive consideration or the legality,
         validity, regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The
         applicable Letter of Credit Bank will promptly notify the Agent and the
         Agent will promptly notify the other Banks of the amount of any
         unreimbursed amounts and each Bank will promptly pay such Letter of
         Credit Bank for its pro rata share of such unreimbursed amounts as
         provided in subsection 2.6(c). As to any draft honored by a Letter of
         Credit Bank in other than U.S. currency, the reimbursement obligation
         of the Borrower shall be, at the Borrower's option: (i) in United
         States currency after application of the appropriate foreign exchange
         rate at the time such draft is honored by such Letter of Credit Bank,
         or (ii) in immediately available foreign currency funds of the same
         tenor as the payment by such Letter of Credit Bank. The Borrower has
         the risk of all currency fluctuations. For purposes of this Section
         2.6(d), the appropriate foreign exchange rate shall be that rate
         established by such Letter of Credit Bank applicable to such foreign
         currency on the date such draft is honored.

                  (e)      Amendments. Any extension of the stated expiry date
         of any Letter of Credit or increase in the stated amount of any Letter
         of Credit shall be made only upon satisfaction of all of the procedures
         and conditions for the issuance of a new Letter of Credit of the same
         type.

                  (f)      Indemnification; Nature of Such Letter of Credit
         Bank's Duties.

                           (i)      In addition to its other obligations under
                  this Section 2.6, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect,
                  indemnify, pay and save each Letter of Credit Bank and each
                  Bank harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,
                  liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses
                  (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that any Letter of
                  Credit Bank or any Bank may incur or be subject to as a
                  consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of any
                  Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of any Letter of Credit
                  Bank to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result
                  of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any
                  present or future de jure or de facto government or
                  governmental authority (all such acts or omissions, herein
                  called "Government Acts") or (C) any action of nonaction taken
                  at the Borrower's request with respect to any Letter of
                  Credit.

                           (ii)     As between the Borrower on the one hand and
                  each Letter of Credit Bank and the Banks on the other hand,
                  the Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or
                  misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof.
                  Each Letter of Credit Bank and the Banks shall not be
                  responsible: (A) for the form, validity, sufficiency,
                  accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document
                  submitted by any party in connection with the application for,
                  issuance of and drawing under any Letter of Credit, even if it
                  should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
                  insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the
                  validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
                  assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of
                  Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
                  thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or
                  ineffective for any reason; (C) for the performance of any
                  beneficiary of a Letter of Credit of its obligations to the
                  Borrower or any failure of any such beneficiary to comply
                  fully with conditions required in order to draw upon a Letter
                  of Credit; (D) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays
                  in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable,
                  telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in
                  cipher; (E) for errors in interpretation of technical terms;
                  (F) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of
                  any document required in order to make a drawing under a
                  Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (G) for any
                  consequences arising from causes beyond the control of any
                  Letter of Credit Bank or any Bank, including, without
                  limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall
                  affect, impair, or prevent the vesting or enforcement of the
                  Letter of Credit Bank's or any Bank's rights or powers
                  hereunder.

                           (iii)    In issuing each Letter of Credit, the
                  applicable Letter of Credit Bank is expressly authorized to
                  make changes from the terms set forth in the request for such
                  Letter of Credit as such Letter of Credit Bank, in its sole
                  discretion, may deem advisable, provided that no such changes
                  will vary the principal terms thereof. Unless otherwise
                  expressly agreed by a Letter of Credit Bank and the Borrower
                  when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the
                  "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the
                  Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such
                  later version thereof as may be in effect at the time of
                  issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and
                  (ii) the rules of


<PAGE>   26

                                                                         Page 26


                  the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as
                  most recently published by the International Chamber of
                  Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance (including the
                  ICC decision published by the Commission on Banking Technique
                  and Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single
                  currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of
                  Credit.

                           (iv)     If there is any discrepancy between the
                  documents accompanying a draft or other demand for payment or
                  acceptance under a Letter of Credit and the specifications for
                  such documents in the Borrower's request for such Letter of
                  Credit or the Letter of Credit, and either (A) the applicable
                  Letter of Credit Bank delivers electronic, telephonic or other
                  written notice to the Borrower's principal office of such
                  discrepancy, and the Borrower does not deliver telephonic or
                  written instruction to the applicable Letter of Credit Bank's
                  letter of credit department to dishonor the draft or demand by
                  noon, local time for the applicable Letter of Credit Bank on
                  the Business Day after the Business Day on which the
                  applicable Letter of Credit Bank shall have delivered notice
                  to the Borrower of the discrepancy, or (B) in the case of a
                  commercial Letter of Credit, the Borrower has obtained
                  possession of the goods that are the subject of such Letter of
                  Credit; then the applicable Letter of Credit Bank may
                  conclusively presume that the Borrower has waived any
                  objection to payment or acceptance, as the case may be, based
                  on such discrepancy, and the applicable Letter of Credit Bank
                  may, but shall not be obligated to, honor the draft or other
                  demand under the Letter of Credit (and may honor such draft
                  after noon on such Business Day, if such Business Day is the
                  last day to which such Letter of Credit Bank is entitled to
                  defer honor of such draft under applicable law). In such
                  event, the Borrower shall be liable to the applicable Letter
                  of Credit Bank pursuant to subsection 2.6(d) as if the
                  discrepancy had not been in the documents.

                           (v)      In furtherance and extension and not in
                  limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth,
                  any action taken or omitted by any Letter of Credit Bank or
                  any Bank, under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or
                  the related documents, if taken or omitted in good faith,
                  shall not put such Letter of Credit Bank or such Bank under
                  any resulting liability to the Borrower. It is the intention
                  of the parties that this Loan Agreement shall be construed and
                  applied to protect and indemnify each Letter of Credit Bank
                  and the Banks against any and all risks involved in the
                  issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are
                  hereby assumed by the Borrower, including, without limitation,
                  any and all risks of the acts or omissions, whether rightful
                  or wrongful, of any present or future Government Acts. The
                  Letter of Credit Banks and the Banks shall not, in any way, be
                  liable for any failure by any Letter of Credit Bank or anyone
                  else to pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result
                  of any Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control
                  of each Letter of Credit Bank.

                           (vi)     Nothing in this subsection (f) is intended
                  to limit the reimbursement obligation of the Borrower
                  contained in subsection 2.6(d). The

                  obligations of the Borrower under this subsection (f) shall
                  survive the termination of this Loan Agreement. No act or
                  omissions of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of
                  Credit shall in any way affect or impair the rights of any
                  Letter of Credit Bank or any Bank to enforce any right, power
                  or benefit under this Loan Agreement.

                           (vii)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
                  contained in this subsection (f), the Borrower shall have no
                  obligation to indemnify any Letter of Credit Bank or any Bank
                  in respect of any liability incurred by such Letter of Credit
                  Bank or such Bank arising solely out of the gross negligence
                  or willful misconduct of the applicable Letter of Credit Bank
                  or such Bank, as the case may be, as finally determined by a
                  court of competent jurisdiction.

                  (g)      Limitation on Obligation of each Letter of Credit
         Bank. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
         Letter of Credit Bank shall be under any obligation to issue, renew or
         extend any Letter of Credit if any order, judgment or decree of any
         governmental authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to
         enjoin or restrain a Letter of Credit Bank from issuing a Letter of
         Credit, or any applicable law, rule or regulation or any request or
         directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
         governmental authority with jurisdiction over such Letter of Credit
         Bank shall prohibit, or request that a Letter of Credit Bank refrain
         from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or any such Letter of
         Credit in particular, or shall impose upon such Letter of Credit Bank
         with respect to any such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or
         capital requirement (for which such Letter of Credit Bank is not
         otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or
         shall impose upon a Letter of Credit Bank any unreimbursed loss, costs
         or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such
         Letter of Credit Bank should deem material to it in good faith.

         2.7      TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.

         The Borrower may from time to time permanently terminate the unused
Commitments in whole or in part (in minimum aggregate amounts of $5,000,000),
ratably as to all Banks, upon three Business Days' prior written notice to the
Agent.

         2.8      FEES.

                  (a)      Upfront Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay each Bank an
         amount equal to 0.375% of the amount of such Bank's Committed Amount.
         Such fees shall be due and payable on the date hereof.

                  (b)      Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
         the account of each Bank a fee for each Bank on such Bank's Committed
         Amount at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin. The foregoing
         commitment fee shall be paid quarterly in arrears on the last day of
         each calendar quarter.

                                                                         Page 28


                  (c)      Standby Letter of Credit Commission. In consideration
         of the issuance of standby Letters of Credit hereunder, the Borrower
         agrees to pay to the applicable Letter of Credit Bank a letter of
         credit commission at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin
         for standby Letters of Credit on the maximum amount available to be
         drawn under each of the standby Letters of Credit issued by such Letter
         of Credit Bank from the date of issuance to the date of expiration. The
         foregoing commission shall be shared by the Banks (including the
         applicable Letter of Credit Bank in its capacity as a Bank) in
         accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages. The foregoing
         commission shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar
         quarter. In addition to the foregoing, the Borrower agrees to pay a
         letter of credit fronting fee to the applicable Letter of Credit Bank
         (for its sole account) at a per annum rate equal to 1/8% on the maximum
         amount available to be drawn under each of the standby Letters of
         Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Bank from the date of issuance.
         The foregoing fee shall be payable in advance on the date of issuance
         (or extension) of standby Letter of Credit.

                  (d)      Commercial Letter of Credit Commission. In
         consideration of the issuance of commercial Letters of Credit
         hereunder, the Borrower agrees to pay to the applicable Letter of
         Credit Bank, for the ratable benefit of all of the Banks, the following
         amounts: (i) a letter of credit commission on the date of each drawing
         thereunder equal to the Applicable Margin for commercial Letters of
         Credit on the amount of such drawing with respect to the commercial
         Letters of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Bank and (ii) if a
         Letter of Credit Bank accepts or purchases any draft with respect to
         any Letter of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Bank, an
         acceptance commission equal to 2% per annum on the amount of any such
         draft on the date of such acceptance or purchase. The foregoing fees
         shall be shared by the Banks (including the applicable Letter of Credit
         Bank in its capacity as a Bank) in accordance with their respective
         Commitment Percentages and shall be distributed by the applicable
         Letter of Credit Bank to the Banks in arrears on the last day of each
         calendar quarter.

         In addition to the foregoing letter of credit and acceptance
         commission, the Borrower will pay to the applicable Letter of Credit
         Bank, for its sole use and benefit, such other customary fees of such
         Letter of Credit Bank as may be agreed to from time to time by the
         Borrower and such Letter of Credit Bank.

                  (e)      Agent's Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent
         the fees specified in the letter agreement of even date herewith by and
         between the Borrower and the Agent, as such agreement may be modified
         or supplemented from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE III

                      ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING LOANS

         3.1      DEFAULT RATE.


<PAGE>   29

                                                                         Page 29


         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of Default
hereunder, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans hereunder and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (other than amounts owing under Section 2.6(d) hereof) shall bear
interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the rate which
would otherwise be applicable.

         3.2      PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
         right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time without
         premium or penalty without prior notice with respect to Prime Rate
         Loans and upon one Business Day's prior written notice or telephonic
         notice (confirmed immediately thereafter in writing) to the Agent with
         respect to all other Loans; provided, however, that each such partial
         prepayment shall be a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000; provided
         further, the Borrower shall pay all amounts payable under Section 3.6
         hereof in connection with any such prepayment. Amounts prepaid on the
         Loans may be reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof. If
         the Borrower shall fail to specify the manner of application,
         prepayments shall be applied first to Prime Rate Loans, then to
         Eurodollar Loans (taken as a group) in direct order of their Interest
         Period maturities.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i)      Commitments. If at any time the sum of the
                                    outstanding principal amount of the
                  Revolving Loans and the Letter of Credit Obligations shall
                  exceed the then applicable Maximum Commitment, then the
                  Borrower shall immediately pay the Agent, for the account of
                  the Banks, an amount equal to the deficiency. Payments made
                  hereunder shall be applied first, to the Revolving Loans (and
                  with respect to the types of Revolving Loans comprising the
                  Revolving Loans, first to Prime Rate Loans, and then to
                  Eurodollar Loans in direct order of their Interest Period
                  maturities), and second, to the Letter of Credit Obligations.

                           (ii)     Clean-Down Payments. The Borrower shall
                  reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving
                  Loans to zero for 30 consecutive days during each period
                  beginning on December 15 of any Fiscal Year and ending on
                  April 15 of the following Fiscal Year (commencing with the
                  period beginning December 15, 2001 and ending on April 15,
                  2002).

         3.3      CONVERSION.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent Interest Period or to convert Loans into Loans
of another type; provided, however, that (i) except as provided in Section 3.4,
Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Loans of another type only on the last
day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Eurodollar Loans may be
extended, and Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Loans, only if no Default
or Event of Default is in existence on the date of extension or conversion,
(iii) Loans extended as, or


<PAGE>   30

                                                                         Page 30


converted into, Eurodollar Loans shall be in such minimum amounts as provided in
Section 2.2(b), and (iv) any request for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a
request for an Interest Period of one month or 30 days, respectively. Each such
extension or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving written
notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Agent
(including requests for extensions and renewals, a "Notice of Conversion") prior
to 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco, California time) on the Business Day of, in the
case of existing Prime Rate Loans, and on the third Business Day prior to, in
the case of existing Eurodollar Loans, the date of the proposed extension or
conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension or conversion, the
Loans to be so extended or converted, the types of Loans into which such Loans
are to be converted and, if appropriate, the applicable Interest Periods with
respect thereto. Each request for extension or conversion shall be deemed to be
a reaffirmation by the Borrower that no Default or Event of Default then exists
and is continuing and that the representations and warranties set forth in
Article V are true and correct in all material respects as of the date of such
Notice of Conversion (except to the extent they relate to an earlier period). In
the event the Borrower fails to request extension or conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan in accordance with this Section, or any such conversion or
extension is not permitted or required by this Section, then such Loans shall be
automatically converted into Prime Rate Loans at the end of their respective
Interest Periods. The Agent shall give each Bank notice as promptly as
practicable of any such proposed conversion affecting any Loans.

         3.4      INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY, ETC.

         In the event any Bank shall determine (which determination shall be
final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto absent manifest
error):

                  (a)      Unavailability. On any date for determining the
         appropriate Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period, that by
         reason of any changes arising on or after the date of this Loan
         Agreement affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, dollar deposits in
         the principal amount requested are not generally available in the
         interbank Eurodollar market, or adequate, and fair means do not exist
         for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for
         in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate; then Eurodollar Loans
         will no longer be available, and requests for a Eurodollar Loan shall
         be deemed requests for Prime Rate Loans, until such time as such Bank
         shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise thereto no
         longer exist.

                  (b)      Increased Costs. At any time, that such Bank shall
         incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or
         receivable hereunder with respect to the making, the commitment to make
         or the maintaining of any Eurodollar Loans because of (x) any change
         since the date of this Loan Agreement in any applicable law,
         governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the
         interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction
         of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order)
         including without limitation the imposition, modification or deemed
         applicability of any reserves, deposits or similar requirements as
         related to Eurodollar Loans (such as, for example, but not limited to,
         a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all


<PAGE>   31

                                                                         Page 31


         events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent
         included in the computation of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) and/or (y)
         other circumstances affecting such Bank, the interbank Eurodollar
         market or the position of such Bank in such market; then the Borrower
         shall pay to such Bank promptly upon written demand therefor, such
         additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different
         method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Bank may determine
         in its sole discretion) as may be required to compensate such Bank for
         such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder
         (written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Bank, showing
         the basis for calculation thereof, shall, absent manifest error, be
         final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto).

                  (c)      Illegality. At any time, that the making or
         continuance of any Eurodollar Loan has become unlawful by compliance by
         such Bank in good faith with any law, governmental rule, regulation,
         guideline or order (or would conflict with any such governmental rule,
         regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though
         the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or has become
         impractical as a result of a contingency occurring after the date of
         this Loan Agreement which materially and adversely affects the
         interbank Eurodollar market; then Eurodollar Loans will no longer be
         available, requests for Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed requests for
         Prime Rate Loans and the Borrower may, and upon direction of the Bank,
         shall, as promptly as possible and, in any event within the time period
         required by law, have any such Eurodollar Loans then outstanding
         converted into Prime Rate Loans.

         3.5      INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCED RETURN.

                  (a)      If the Agent shall have determined that the adoption
         or implementation of, or any change in, any law, rule, treaty or
         regulation, or any policy, guideline or directive of, or any change in
         the interpretation or administration thereof by, any court, central
         bank or other administrative or governmental authority, or the
         compliance by any Bank or any lending office of any Bank with any
         directive of or guideline from any central bank or other governmental
         authority or the introduction of or change in any accounting principles
         applicable to any Bank or any lending office of any Bank (in each case,
         whether or not having the force of law), shall (i) change the basis of
         taxation of payments to any Bank or any lending office of any Bank of
         any amounts payable hereunder (except for taxes on the overall income
         of any Bank or any lending office of any Bank), (ii) impose, modify or
         deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement
         against any Loan or Letter of Credit or against assets of or held by,
         or deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank
         or any lending office of any Bank, or (iii) impose on any Bank or any
         lending office of any Bank any other condition regarding this Loan
         Agreement, and the result of any event referred to in clauses (i), (ii)
         or (iii) above shall be to increase the cost to any Bank or any lending
         office of any Bank of making any Loan, maintaining its Commitment to
         make any Loan or participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce
         any amount received or receivable by any Bank hereunder, then, upon
         demand by such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
         additional amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased
         costs or reductions in amount,


<PAGE>   32

                                                                         Page 32


         together with interest on such additional amounts calculated from the
         date such costs or reductions are incurred.

                  (b)      If any Bank shall have determined that any Capital
         Guideline or adoption or implementation of, or any change in, any
         Capital Guideline by the governmental authority charged with the
         interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank or
         any lending office of such Bank with any Capital Guideline or with any
         request or directive of any such governmental authority with respect to
         any Capital Guideline, or the implementation of, or any change in, any
         applicable accounting principles (in each case, whether or not having
         the force of law), either (i) affects or would affect the amount of
         capital required or expected to be maintained by any Bank or any
         lending office of such Bank, and such Bank determines that the amount
         of such capital is increased as a direct or indirect consequence of any
         Loans or Letters of Credit made or maintained or any Commitment to make
         Revolving Loans or to participate in Letters of Credit, or such Bank's
         or such lending office's other obligations hereunder, or (ii) has or
         would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or
         such lending office's capital to a level below that which such Bank
         could have achieved but for such circumstances as a consequence of any
         Loans made or maintained, or the Commitment to make Revolving Loans,
         such Bank's or such lending office's other obligations hereunder (in
         each case, taking into consideration the Bank's or such lending
         office's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon demand
         by such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank from time to time
         such additional amounts as will compensate such Bank for such cost of
         maintaining such increased capital or such reduction in the rate of
         return on the such Bank's or such lending office's capital.

                  (c)      Upon determining in good faith than any additional
         amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section, any Bank will give
         prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set
         forth the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, although
         the failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish any
         of the Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to
         this Section; provided, however, the Borrower shall not be obligated to
         pay any of such amounts to any such Bank until it receives the
         applicable notice from such Bank. Determination by any Bank of amounts
         owing under this Section shall, absent manifest error, be final and
         conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. Failure on the part of
         any Bank to demand compensation for any period hereunder shall not
         constitute a waiver of such Bank's rights to demand any such
         compensation in such period or in any other period.

                  (d)      The Borrower will reimburse each Letter of Credit
         Bank on demand for all charges and expenses made or incurred by such
         Letter of Credit Bank in connection with each Letter of Credit issued
         by such Letter of Credit Bank including any increased expense to such
         Letter of Credit Bank resulting from the application of any tax (other
         than income tax), reserve requirement or deposit insurance premiums;
         the amount of such charges and expenses to be determined by such Letter
         of Credit Bank in good faith.

                  (e)      All amounts payable under this Section 3.5 shall bear
         interest from the date that is three Business Days after the date of
         demand by any Bank until payment in full to such Bank at a per annum
         rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 2%.

         3.6      COMPENSATION.

         The Borrower shall compensate each Bank, upon its written request
(which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such compensation), for
all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation,
any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Bank to fund its
Eurodollar Loans) which such Bank may sustain:

                  (a)      if for any reason (other than a default by such Bank
         or the Agent) a borrowing of Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date
         specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion;

                  (b)      if any repayment or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan
         occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period
         applicable thereto;

                  (c)      if any prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan is not made
         on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower;
         or

                  (d)      as a consequence of any other default by the Borrower
         to repay its Loans or any Letter of Credit Obligations when required by
         the terms of this Loan Agreement.

Calculation of all amounts payable to a Bank under this Section shall be made as
though such Bank has actually funded its relevant Eurodollar Loan through the
purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate in an
amount equal to the amount of that Loan, having a maturity comparable to the
relevant Interest Period and in the case of Eurodollar Loans, through the
transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that Bank to a
domestic office of that Bank in the United States of America; provided, however,
that each Bank may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it sees fit
and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of
amounts payable under this Section.

         3.7      TAXES.

                  (a)      All payments made by the Borrower hereunder, under
         the Notes or under any Loan Document will be made without setoff,
         counterclaim, deduction or other defense. All such payments shall be
         made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future
         income, franchise, sales, use, excise, stamp or other taxes, levies,
         imposts, deductions, charges, fees, withholdings, restrictions or
         conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected,
         withheld or assessed by any jurisdiction (whether pursuant to United
         States Federal, state, local or foreign law) or by any political
         subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, and all interest,
         penalties or similar liabilities, excluding taxes on the overall income
         of a Bank or any lending office of such Bank, (such nonexcluded taxes
         are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Taxes"). If

                                                                         Page 34


         the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or to withhold any
         Taxes from or in respect of any amount payable hereunder, (i) the
         amount so payable shall be increased to the extent necessary so that
         after making all required deductions and withholdings (including Taxes
         on amounts payable to the Banks pursuant to this sentence) the Banks
         receive an amount equal to the sum they would have received had no such
         deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such
         deductions or withholdings, and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
         amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority in
         accordance with applicable law; provided, however, if any Bank
         subsequently recovers any of such deductions or withholdings, such Bank
         shall promptly refund to the Borrower the amount of such deductions or
         withholdings. Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as
         promptly as possible thereafter, the Borrower shall send the Banks and
         the Agent an official receipt showing payment. In addition, the
         Borrower agrees to pay any present or future taxes, charges or similar
         levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
         execution, delivery, performance, recordation or filing of, or
         otherwise with respect to, this Loan Agreement, the Notes or any other
         Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (b)      The Borrower will indemnify the Banks for the amount
         of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or
         Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
         Section 3.7) paid by any Bank and any liability (including penalties,
         interest and expenses for nonpayment, late payment or otherwise)
         whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
         asserted. This indemnification shall be paid within 30 days from the
         date on which such Bank makes written demand; provided, however, the
         Borrower shall have the right to contest any such Taxes before any
         appropriate administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction so
         long as such Bank is not adversely affected by any such contest, as
         reasonably determined by such Bank.

                  (c)      Each Bank which is a foreign person (i.e., a Person
         other than a United States Person for United States Federal income tax
         purposes) hereby agrees that:

                           (i)      it shall, no later than the Closing Date
                  (or, in the case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto
                  pursuant to Section 10.3(b) hereof after the Closing Date, the
                  date upon which such Bank becomes a party hereto) deliver to
                  the Borrower through the Agent:

                                    (A)      two accurate and complete signed
                           originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or

                                    (B)      two accurate and complete signed
                           originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,

                  in each case indicating that such Bank is on the date of
                  delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal,
                  interest and fees for the account of such lending office or
                  offices under this Loan Agreement free from withholding of
                  United States Federal income tax;

                                                                         Page 35


                           (ii)     if at any time such Bank changes its lending
                  office or offices or selects an additional lending office, it
                  shall, at the same time or reasonably promptly thereafter,
                  deliver to the Borrower through the Agent in replacement for,
                  or in addition to, the forms previously delivered by it
                  hereunder;

                                    (A)      if such changed or additional
                           lending office is located in the United States, two
                           accurate and complete signed originals of Internal
                           Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or

                                    (B)      otherwise, two accurate and
                           complete signed originals of Internal Revenue Service
                           Form W-8ECI,

                  in each case indicating that such Bank is on the date of
                  delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal,
                  interest and fees for the account of such changed or
                  additional lending office under this Loan Agreement free from
                  withholding of United States federal income tax; and

                           (iii)    it shall, promptly upon the Borrower's
                  reasonable request to that effect, deliver to the Borrower
                  such other forms or similar documentation as may be required
                  from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or
                  regulation in order to establish such Bank's tax status for
                  withholding purposes.

                  (d)      If the Borrower fails to perform its obligations
         under this Section 3.7, the Borrower shall indemnify the Banks for any
         incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable as a
         result of any such failure.

         3.8      CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE.

         Each Bank agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to
the operation of Section 3.4(b) or (c) or 3.7, it will, if requested by the
Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of
such Bank) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such
event, provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Bank and
its lending office suffer no disadvantage (including, without limitation, no
economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage), with the object of avoiding the
consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such Section.
Nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the
Borrower or the right of any Bank provided in Sections 3.4, 3.5, or 3.7.

         3.9      LATE PAYMENT FEE.

         Should any principal installment payment be in default for more than 15
days, there may be imposed, to the extent permitted by law, a delinquency charge
not to exceed 2% of such installment in default. In addition, at the Majority
Banks' option, any overdue interest, fees and charges may, for purposes of
computing and accruing interest, be deemed to be a part of the


<PAGE>   36

                                                                         Page 36


corresponding principal Obligation and interest shall accrue on a daily
compounded basis after such date (at the applicable rate, including any default
rate under Section 3.1) thereon.

         3.10     PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

         Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments
hereunder shall be made to the Agent in U.S. dollars in immediately available
funds at its offices in at the address set forth in Exhibit 10.1 hereto not
later than 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco, California time) on the date when due,
without set-off or counterclaim. Payments received after such time shall be
deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Agent will
thereafter cause to be distributed promptly like funds relating to the payment
of principal or interest or fees ratably to the Banks entitled to receive such
payments in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement. Whenever any
payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business
Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
(subject to accrual of interest and fees for the period of such extension),
except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the
payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall
instead be made on the next preceding Business Day. All computations of interest
and fees shall be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year
of 360 days (except for the calculations in respect of interest at the Bank of
America prime rate, which shall be based on the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 365/366 days). Interest shall accrue from and include the date of
such Loan, but exclude the date of payment.

         3.11     REPLACEMENT OR REMOVAL OF BANK.

         In the event that the Agent receives one or more notices claiming
compensation, reimbursement or indemnity (each, a "Compensation Notice")
pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.4, 3.5 or 3.7 and the aggregate amount
of all such compensation, reimbursement or indemnity payments made or required
to be made by the Borrower to such Bank pursuant to Sections 3.4, 3.5 or 3.7 is
materially greater (as determined by the Borrower in its reasonable judgment)
than the weighted average amount of payments made or required to be made to the
other Banks pursuant to Sections 3.4, 3.5 or 3.7, then, so long as no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower may, within
60 days after receipt of any such Compensation Notice, elect to terminate such
Bank as a party to this Loan Agreement. If any Bank to be terminated has a
Commitment which, together with the amount of any Commitment or Commitments
theretofore or concurrently therewith to be reduced in accordance with this
Section 3.11, aggregates 30% or less of the aggregate Commitments, the Borrower
may elect either to replace such Bank with another financial institution
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (a "Replacement Bank") or to reduce the
Commitments by the amount of the Commitment of such Bank. If any Bank to be
terminated has a Commitment which, together with the amount of any Commitment or
Commitments theretofore or concurrently therewith to be reduced in accordance
with this Section 3.11, aggregates in excess of 30% of the aggregate
Commitments, the Borrower may elect to terminate such Bank only if, together
with its notice of termination, it provides to the Agent a commitment from a
Replacement Bank to replace the Commitment of the terminated Bank under this
Loan Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

                                                                         PAge 37


The Borrower's election to terminate a Bank under this Section 3.11 shall be set
forth in a written notice from the Borrower to the Agent (with a copy to such
Bank), setting forth (i) the basis for termination of such Bank, (ii) whether
the Borrower intends to replace such Bank with a Replacement Bank or (if the
Borrower is not required to replace such Bank) to reduce the Commitments by the
amount of the Commitment of such Bank, and (iii) the date (not later than 30
days after the date of such notice) when such termination shall become effective
(the "Termination Effective Date"). On the Termination Effective Date, (x) the
Borrower and/or the Replacement Bank, as applicable, shall pay the terminated
Bank an amount equal to all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owed to
such Bank (including, without limitation, any amounts owed under Sections 3.4,
3.5 or 3.7), through the date on which such termination becomes effective, and
(y) there shall have been received by the Agent all documents and supporting
materials necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Agent to evidence the
substitution of the Replacement Bank for such Bank or, if there is no
Replacement Bank, to reflect the adjustment of the Commitments, including,
without limitation, any necessary or appropriate adjustments to the Commitment
Percentages, such adjustments to the Committed Percentage of any remaining Bank
to be based upon the percentage of such Bank's Committed Amount to the aggregate
Committed Amounts of all of the remaining Banks.

         3.12     ADVANCES.

                  (i)      No Bank shall be responsible for the failure or delay
         by any other Bank in its obligation to make its ratable share of a
         borrowing hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank to
         fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank of
         its obligations hereunder.

                  (ii)     Unless the Borrower or any Bank has notified the
         Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the
         Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Bank, as the case may be,
         will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower or
         such Bank, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may
         (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available
         a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
         extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Agent in
         immediately available funds, then:

                                    (A)      if the Borrower failed to make such
                           payment, each Bank shall forthwith on demand repay to
                           the Agent the portion of such assumed payment that
                           was made available to such Bank in immediately
                           available funds, together with interest thereon in
                           respect of each day from and including the date such
                           amount was made available by the Agent to such Bank
                           to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent in
                           immediately available funds, at the Federal Funds
                           Rate from time to time in effect; and

                                    (B)      if any Bank failed to make such
                           payment, such Bank shall forthwith on demand pay to
                           the Agent the amount thereof in immediately available
                           funds, together with interest thereon for the period
                           from the date such amount was made available by the
                           Agent to the Borrower to the date


<PAGE>   38

                                                                         Page 38


                           such amount is recovered by the Agent (the
                           "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum equal to
                           the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.
                           If such Bank does not pay such amount forthwith upon
                           the Agent's demand therefor, the Agent may make a
                           demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower
                           shall pay such amount to the Agent, together with
                           interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a
                           rate per annum equal to the rate of interest
                           applicable to the applicable borrowing.

                  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Bank from its
                  obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any
                  rights that the Agent or the Borrower may have against any
                  Bank as a result of any default by such Bank hereunder. A
                  notice of the Agent to any Bank with respect to any amount
                  owing under this subsection (ii) shall be conclusive, absent
                  manifest error.

                        CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO ALL LOANS

         licensed or qualified as a foreign corporation authorized to transact
         business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
         character of the properties owned by it or the nature of the business
         transacted by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary.

                  (c)      Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, the Borrower
         has no Subsidiaries other than as identified in Exhibit 5.1(c) hereto.

         and authority to own its assets and properties, and to operate its
         business as presently owned and conducted. Exhibit 5.1(c) correctly

         5.2      AUTHORIZATION OF BORROWING; NO CONFLICTS; BINDING OBLIGATIONS;
                  ETC.

                  (a)      Authorization of Borrowing. The execution, delivery
         and performance by the Borrower of this Loan Agreement and the
         issuance, delivery and payment of the Notes have been duly authorized
         by all necessary corporate action by the Borrower.

                  (b)      No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance
         by the Borrower of this Loan Agreement and the issuance, delivery and
         payment of the Notes do not and will not (i) violate any provision of
         law applicable to the Borrower, the Restated Charter (as amended) or
         Bylaws of the Borrower or the Charter or Certificate or Articles of
         Incorporation or Articles of Association or Bylaws or Memoranda of
         Association of any Subsidiary of the Borrower, or any order, judgment

         default under any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of
         any Lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of
         the properties or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or

         performance by the Borrower of this Loan Agreement, and the issuance,

                                                                         Page 42


         to, or other action to, with or by, any federal, state or other
         governmental authority or regulatory body or other Person.

                  (d)      Binding Obligation. This Loan Agreement is, and the
         Notes when executed and delivered hereunder will be, the legally valid
         and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the
         Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, except as
         enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
         laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
         equitable remedies.

         5.3      FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO CHANGES.

                  (a)      Financial Statements. The Borrower has heretofore
         delivered to the Banks the audited consolidated financial statements of
         the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Years 2001 and 2000,
         consisting of the Borrower's consolidated balance sheets as at such
         dates and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of cash
         flows and shareholders equity for the Fiscal Years then ended. Such
         statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present in
         all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at the date thereof.

                  (b)      Contingent Obligations. As of the Closing Date,
         neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
         Contingent Obligation which is not reflected in the financial
         statements delivered pursuant to Subsection 5.3(a) or in the notes
         thereto or otherwise permitted by Section 7.3.

                  (c)      No Material Adverse Effect. Since February 3, 2001,
         there has been no development or event relating to or affecting the
         Borrower or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which has had or could
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d)      Restricted Payments. Since February 3, 2001, the
         Borrower has not directly or indirectly declared, ordered, paid or made
         or set apart any sum of money or any property for any Restricted
         Payment or agreed to do so, except for the regular quarterly dividends
         on the Borrower's Preferred Stock permitted pursuant to Section 7.4(b).

         5.4      TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LIENS.

         The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have good and legal title to all
properties and assets, real and personal, tangible and intangible, reflected in
the consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower as at February 3, 2001 referred
to in Subsection 5.3(a) except for assets acquired or disposed of either in the
ordinary course of business since the date of such consolidated balance sheet or
as otherwise permitted by this Loan Agreement. All such properties and assets
are free and clear of Liens, except as permitted under Section 7.1.

                                                                         Page 43


         5.5      LITIGATION.

         Except as set forth in the notes to the Borrower's financial statements
for the Fiscal Year 2001, there is no action, suit, proceeding or arbitration
(whether or not purportedly on behalf of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries) at law or in equity or before or by any federal, state, municipal
or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign, pending or to the knowledge of the
Borrower threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.6      COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

         Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (i) in violation of
any applicable law which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) subject to or in default with respect to any final judgment,
writ, injunction, decree, rule or regulation of any court or federal, state,
municipal or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign, which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.7      PAYMENT OF TAXES.

         As of the Closing Date, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed
all federal tax returns and all other tax returns that, to the best knowledge of
the Borrower's officers, after due inquiry, are required to be filed by any of
them, and have paid all taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges
upon the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and upon their respective properties and
assets (real and personal, tangible and intangible), income and franchises which
are due and payable in accordance with such returns, except to the extent
permitted by Section 6.3. As of the Closing Date, the charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any
taxes or governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate and
the Borrower does not know of any proposed tax assessment against it or any of
its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.8      CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS: PERFORMANCE.

                  (a)      Contractual Obligations.. Except as set forth in
         Exhibit 5.8(a) hereto, as of the Closing Date neither the Borrower nor
         any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is subject to any Contractual
         Obligation (other than Contractual Obligations entered into in the
         ordinary course of business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or as
         otherwise permitted by this Loan Agreement) that is material to the
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of such
         Contractual Obligations in existence as of the Closing Date will
         materially adversely affect the ability of the Borrower to perform its
         Obligations.

                  (b)      Performance. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
         Subsidiaries is in default in the performance, observance or
         fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or

                                                                         Page 44


         conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower and
         any of its Subsidiaries and no condition exists which, with the giving
         of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a
         default, except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of such
         default or defaults, if any, would not reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

and conditions of the required permits, licenses and authorizations, and is also

there is no civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, demand, claim,
hearing, notice of violation, investigation, proceeding, notice or demand letter
pending or threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating
in any way to the Environmental Laws which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect; and there are no past or present (or, to the best of
the Borrower's knowledge, future) events, conditions, circumstances, activities,
practices, incidents, actions or plans which may interfere with or prevent
compliance or continued compliance with the Environmental Laws, or which may
give rise to any common law or other legal liability, including, without
limitation, liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, or any similar state, local or
foreign laws, or otherwise form the basis of any claim, action, demand, suit,
proceeding, hearing, notice of violation, study or investigation, based on or
related to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage,
disposal, transport or handling, or the emission, discharge, release or
threatened release into the environment, of any pollutant, contaminant, chemical
or industrial, toxic or hazardous substance or waste, except to the extent that
such non-compliance or liability would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.10     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
ERISA Affiliates is in compliance in all material respects with any applicable

to any Multiemployer Plan, other than the withdrawal liability of the Grief
Compliance to the ACTWU Pension Fund.

purpose which might constitute this transaction a "purpose credit" within the
meaning of Regulation U or Regulation X.

         provided, that, if during any Fiscal Year Capital Expenditures are less
         than the amount set forth above for such Fiscal Year, the lesser of (i)
         the difference between the amount set forth above for such Fiscal Year

         Subsection 7.5(d) for the immediately succeeding Fiscal Year, but not
         for any other subsequent Fiscal Year, except to the extent permitted by

         succeeding Fiscal Year shall be applied first to the Excess Capital
         Expenditures Allowance carried forward until such Allowance is
         exhausted and shall then be applied to the maximum Capital Expenditures
         specified above for such Fiscal Year in determining whether an Excess
         Capital Expenditure Allowance is available to be carried forward to the
         next succeeding Fiscal Year in the manner described in this Subsection

constituting in the aggregate for all of such transactions consummated on or
after the end of the second fiscal quarter of Fiscal Year 2001 more than 10% of
Consolidated Tangible Assets as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of
Fiscal Year 2001; provided, that, so long as no Event of Default or Default has
occurred and is continuing or would occur as a result thereof, (x) any
Subsidiary of the Borrower may be merged or consolidated with or into the
Borrower or any direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Borrower, or be
liquidated, wound up or dissolved, or all or substantially all of its business,
properties or assets (real and personal, tangible and intangible) may be
conveyed, sold, leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of, in one transaction
or a series of transactions, to the Borrower or any direct wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Borrower; and (y) the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may
acquire any Person by merger or consolidation, provided that the Borrower or

         the Borrower or any of its ERISA Affiliates could be subject to either

         imposed by Section 4975 of the Code in either case in an amount in any
         Fiscal Year greater than $1,000,000;

                  (b)      fail to make full payment when due of all amounts
         which, under the provisions of any Pension Plan or applicable law, the
         Borrower or any of its ERISA Affiliates is required to pay as
         contributions thereto, or permit to exist any accumulated funding
         deficiency with respect to any Pension Plan with respect to any plan

voting power of the Borrower's capital stock, or with any Affiliate of the
Borrower or of any such holder, on terms that are materially less favorable to
the Borrower or that Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those which would be
obtained at the time from Persons who are not such a holder or an Affiliate;
provided, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to any transaction
between the Borrower and any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or between any of
its wholly-owned Subsidiaries.

outstanding after the consummation of such acquisition any Indebtedness
previously incurred by such Subsidiary); or (ii) any of its Subsidiaries,
whether now owned or hereafter created or acquired, to incur any Indebtedness if
the aggregate Indebtedness of all of the Borrower's Subsidiaries (excluding

Indebtedness proposed to be incurred, exceed 7-1/2% of Consolidated Tangible
Assets.

         7.11     RESTRICTIONS ON SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS.

         The Borrower will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any

Subsidiaries to, or the making of loans, advances to, or other Investments by
such Subsidiary in, the Borrower.

         7.12     INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS.

         All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a
particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the

         the consolidated total assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; or

                  (j)      Dissolution. Any order, judgment or decree shall be
         entered against the Borrower decreeing the dissolution or split up of
         the Borrower and such order shall remain undischarged or unstayed for a
         period in excess of thirty (30) days; or

                  (k)      Unfunded ERISA Liabilities.

                           (i)      Any Pension Plan maintained by the Borrower
                  or any of its ERISA Affiliates shall be terminated within the
                  meaning of Title IV of ERISA,

                           (ii)     a trustee shall be appointed by an
                  appropriate United States district court to administer any
                  Pension Plan,

                           (iii)    the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (or
                  any successor thereto) shall institute proceedings to
                  terminate any Pension Plan, or

                           (iv)     the Borrower or any of its ERISA Affiliates
                  shall withdraw (under Section 4063 of ERISA) from a Pension
                  Plan, if, as of the date thereof or any subsequent date, the
                  sum of each of the Borrower's and its ERISA Affiliates'
                  various liabilities (such liabilities to include, without

                  party under Sections 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or any other
                  provision of law) resulting from or otherwise associated with
                  such events listed in clauses (i) through (iv) above exceeds
                  $1,000,000, exclusive of any withdrawal liability incurred by
                  the Grief Companies division of the Borrower to the
                  Amalgamated Pension Fund, a Multiemployer Plan; or

                  (l)      Change of Control. There shall occur a Change of
         Control;

         then, in any such event, and at any time thereafter, the Agent shall,
         upon the written direction of the Majority Banks, or may with the
         consent of the Majority Banks, by written notice to the Borrower take
         any of the following actions:

                           (i)      Termination of Commitments. Declare the
                  Banks' obligations to make Loans and the Letter of Credit
                  Banks' obligations to issue Letters of Credit to be terminated
                  whereupon the Banks' Commitments shall be immediately
                  terminated and any commissions or fees relating to the
                  Commitments shall thereupon become immediately due and payable
                  without further notice of any kind;

                           (ii)     Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid
                  principal of and any accrued interest in respect of all the
                  Notes to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due
                  and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other
                  notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the
                  Borrower;

                           (iii)    Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all
                  rights and interests created and existing under the Loan
                  Documents or applicable law and all rights of set-off;

                           (iv)     Cash Collateral. Direct the Borrower to pay
                  (and the Borrower agrees that upon receipt of such notice, or
                  upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section
                  8.1(f) or (g)), it will immediately without notice pay to the
                  Agent an amount equal to the then outstanding Letter of Credit
                  Obligations which at the option of the Borrower will either be
                  used to prepay such outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations
                  or paid to the Agent to be held in a cash collateral account
                  in the name of the Agent and under the dominion and control of
                  the Agent as additional security for the reimbursement
                  obligations which may thereafter arise on account of
                  subsequent drawings or payments under Letters of Credit still
                  outstanding;

                  provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if an
                  Event of Default specified in Section 8.1(f) or (g) shall
                  occur, then the Banks' Commitments shall automatically
                  terminate and the Notes and the Loans shall immediately become
                  due and payable without the giving of any notice or other
                  action by the Agent or the Banks.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                      AGENT

         9.1      APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF AGENT.

                  (a) Each Bank hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 9.9)
         appoints, designates and authorizes the Agent to take such action on
         its behalf under the provisions of this Loan Agreement and each other
         Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as
         are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Loan Agreement or
         any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably
         incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
         contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Agent
         shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly
         set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any
         fiduciary relationship with any Bank or participant, and no implied
         covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
         liabilities shall be read into this Loan Agreement or any other Loan
         Document or otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the
         generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent"
         herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Agent is
         not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
         obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
         Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
         intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
         between independent contracting parties.

                  (b) Each Letter of Credit Bank shall act on behalf of such
         Letter of Credit with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and
         the documents associated therewith until such time (and except for so
         long) as the Agent may agree at the request of the Majority Banks to
         act for the applicable Letter of Credit Bank with respect thereto;
         provided, however, that each Letter of Credit Bank shall have all of
         the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Agent in this Article
         IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such Letter
         of Credit Bank in connection with any Letters of Credit issued by it or
         proposed to be issued by it and the application and agreements for
         letters of credit pertaining to the Letters of Credit as fully as if
         the term "Agent" as used in this Article IX included the Letter of
         Credit Bank with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as
         additionally provided herein with respect to each Letter of Credit
         Bank.

         9.2      DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Loan Agreement or
any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact
that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         9.3      LIABILITY OF AGENT.

         No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it under or in connection with this Loan Agreement or any
other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (except
for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties
expressly set forth herein or therein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to
any Bank or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by the Borrower or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other
Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection
with, this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Loan Agreement
or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Borrower or any other
party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank or participant
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Loan Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or any
Affiliate thereof.

         9.4      RELIANCE BY AGENT.

                  (a)      The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
         fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
         resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
         letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or
         other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
         and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
         and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
         the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by
         the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to
         take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive
         such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks as it deems
         appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to
         its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense
         which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
         any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
         acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Loan Agreement or any
         other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the
         Majority Banks or all the Banks, if required hereunder, and such
         request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
         be binding upon all the Banks and participants. Where this Loan
         Agreement expressly permits or prohibits an action unless the Majority
         Banks otherwise determine, the Agent shall, and in all other instances,
         the Agent may, but shall not be required to, initiate any solicitation
         for the consent or a vote of the Banks.

                  (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the
         conditions specified in Section 4.1, each Bank that has signed this
         Loan Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or
         accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either
         sent by the Agent to such Bank for consent, approval, acceptance or
         satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
         or acceptable or satisfactory to a Bank.

         9.5      NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults
in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Agent
for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent shall have received written
notice from a Bank or the Borrower referring to this Loan Agreement, describing
such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default." The Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt of any such notice. The
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
may be directed by the Majority Banks in accordance with Article VIII; provided,
however, that unless and until the Agent has received any such direction, the
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable or in the best interest of the Banks.

         9.6      CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY AGENT.

         Each Bank acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of
the affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate thereof, shall
be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related
Person to any Bank as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons
have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Bank represents to
the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory laws
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to
enter into this Loan Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder.
Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Loan
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it
deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Banks by the Agent herein, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of any of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries which
may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

         9.7      INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Banks shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not reimbursed by or on behalf


<PAGE>   65
                                                                         Page 65


of the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so),
pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and
all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no Bank
shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of
such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Agent-Related Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no action taken in
accordance with the directions of the Majority Banks shall be deemed to
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Agent upon
demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable fees and costs of counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with
the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Loan
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred
to herein or therein, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such
expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall
survive termination of the Commitments, the payment of all obligations hereunder
and the resignation or replacement of the Agent.

         9.8      AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with the Borrower and its respective Affiliates as though Bank
of America were not the Agent or a Letter of Credit Bank hereunder and without
notice to or consent of the Banks. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding
the Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such Affiliate) and
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the
same rights and powers under this Loan Agreement as any other Bank and may
exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Agent or a Letter of
Credit Bank, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

         9.9      SUCCESSOR AGENT.

         The Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks. If the
Agent resigns under this Loan Agreement, the Majority Banks shall appoint from
among the Banks a successor Agent for the Banks which successor Agent shall be
consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of a
Default or an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor Agent is appointed prior to
the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Banks and the Borrower, a successor Agent from among the
Banks. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such
successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor Agent and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this


<PAGE>   66
                                                                         Page 66


Article 9 and Sections 10.5 and 10.16 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Loan
Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for
above.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1     NOTICES.

         Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other
communications shall have been duly given and shall be effective (a) when
delivered, (b) when transmitted via telecopy (or other facsimile device) to the
number set out below, (c) the day following the day on which the same has been
delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight air courier service, or (d)
the third Business Day following the day on which the same is sent by certified
or registered mail, postage prepaid, in each case to the respective parties at
the address set forth on Exhibit 10.1 hereto, or at such other address as such
party may specify by written notice to the other parties hereto.

         10.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

         In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law
or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, each Bank is authorized at any time and from
time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind
(all of which rights being hereby expressly waived), to set-off and to
appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other
indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Bank (including, without
limitation, branches, agencies or Affiliates of such Bank wherever located) to
or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against obligations and
liabilities of the Borrower to such Bank hereunder, under the Notes, the other
Loan Documents or otherwise, irrespective of whether such Bank shall have made
any demand hereunder and although such obligations, liabilities or claims, or
any of them, may be contingent or unmatured, and any such set-off shall be
deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
even though such charge is made or entered on the books of such Bank subsequent
thereto. The Borrower hereby agrees that any Person purchasing a participation
in the Loans and Commitments hereunder pursuant to Section 10.3(c) may exercise
all rights of set-off with respect to its participation interest as fully as if
such Person were a Bank hereunder.

         10.3     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a)      The provisions of this Loan Agreement shall be
         binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
         respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
         Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
         obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Bank
         (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such
         consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Loan Agreement,
         expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
         (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
         permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
         Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
         reason of this Loan Agreement.

                  (b)      Any Bank may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees
         all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Loan
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection
         (b), participations in Letter of Credit Obligations) at the time owing
         to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the
         entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment and the
         Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank
         or an Affiliate of a Bank with respect to a Bank, the aggregate amount
         of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding
         thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date
         the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
         delivered to the Agent, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each
         of the Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has
         occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such
         consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) each partial
         assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of
         all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Loan
         Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, and
         (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
         Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form of
         Exhibit 10.3, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
         Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to
         subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
         specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee
         thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
         assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
         obligations of a Bank under this Loan Agreement, and the assigning Bank
         thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
         Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
         Loan Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance
         covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this
         Loan Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
         continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 10.5, 10.14 and
         10.16). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
         deliver new or replacement Notes to the assigning Bank and the assignee
         Bank. Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations
         under this Loan Agreement that does not comply with this subsection
         shall be treated for purposes of this Loan Agreement as a sale by such
         Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance
         with subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c)      The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent
         of the Borrower, shall maintain at its office in San Francisco,
         California a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and
         a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks,
         and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and Letter of
         Credit Obligations owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof
         from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall
         be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks may treat each
         Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
         hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Loan Agreement,
         notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available
         for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and
         from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d)      Any Bank may, without the consent of, or notice to,
         the Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or
         other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Bank's
         rights and/or obligations under this Loan Agreement (including all or a
         portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Bank's
         participations in Letter of Credit Obligations) owing to it); provided
         that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Loan Agreement shall remain
         unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other
         parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the
         Borrower, the Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely
         and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
         obligations under this Loan Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
         pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that
         such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Loan Agreement
         and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
         of this Loan Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
         provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the
         Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification that
         would (i) postpone any date upon which any payment of money is
         scheduled to be paid to such Participant or, (ii) reduce the principal,
         interest, fees or other amounts payable to such Participant. Subject to
         subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
         and 3.7 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its
         interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To
         the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
         the benefits of Section 10.2 as though it were a Bank, provided such
         Participant agrees to be subject to Section 10.15 as though it were a
         Bank.

                  (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
         greater payment under Section 3.4, 3.5 or 3.7 than the applicable Bank
         would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
         sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
         Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A
         Participant that is a foreign person as described in Section 3.7 shall
         not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.7 unless the Borrower is
         notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
         Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
         Section 3.7 as though it were a Bank.

                  (f)      Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security
         interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Loan Agreement
         (including under its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Bank,
         including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
         Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release
         a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
         pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto.

                  (g)      If the consent of the Borrower to an assignment or to
         an Eligible Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an
         assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment threshold
         specified in clause (i) of the proviso to the first sentence of Section
         10.3(b), the Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five
         Business Days after the date notice thereof has been delivered by the
         assigning Bank (through the Agent) unless such consent is expressly
         refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth Business Day.

                  (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, if at any time a Bank assigns all of its Commitment and Loans
         pursuant to subsection (b) above, such Bank may, upon 90 days' notice
         to the Borrower and the Banks, resign as a Letter of Credit Bank;
         provided, however, that in the event that such Letter of Credit Bank
         seeking resignation is the sole Letter of Credit Bank at such time,
         such resignation shall only become effective upon acceptance by another
         Bank to act as a successor Letter of Credit Bank hereunder. Each Letter
         of Credit Bank shall retain all the rights and obligations of a Letter
         of Credit Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit
         outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as a Letter of
         Credit Bank and all Letter of Credit Obligations with respect thereto
         (including the right to require the Banks to make Prime Rate Loans or
         fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.6).

         10.4     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Bank in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document and no
course of dealing between the Borrower and the Agent or any Bank shall operate
as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Agent or any
Bank would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case
shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Agent or the
Banks to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or
demand.

         10.5     PAYMENT OF EXPENSES, ETC.

         The Borrower agrees to: (a) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Agent in connection with the syndication of this Loan Agreement,
the due diligence associated with this transaction and the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery and administration of this Loan Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and the documents and instruments referred to
therein (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of

counsel to the Agent) and any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto and
thereto, including, but not limited to, any such amendments, waivers or consents
resulting from or related to any work-out, renegotiation or restructure relating
to the performance by the Borrower under this Loan Agreement and of the Banks in
connection with enforcement of the Loan Documents and the documents and
instruments referred to therein (including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agent and each of the Banks); (b) pay
and hold each of the Banks harmless from and against any and all present and
future stamp, recording and other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing
matters and save each of the Banks harmless from and against any and all
liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or omission (other than
to the extent attributable to such Bank) to pay such taxes; and (c) indemnify
each Bank, its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents from
and hold each of them harmless against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of,
or in any way related to, or by reason of, any investigation, litigation or
other proceeding (whether or not any Bank is a party thereto) related to the
entering into and/or performance of any Loan Document or the use of proceeds of
any Loans hereunder or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated
in any Loan Document, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence
or willful misconduct on the part of the Person to be indemnified).

         10.6     AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS.

         Neither this Loan Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any of the
terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in
writing signed by the Majority Banks and the Borrower, provided that no such
amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination shall, without the consent
of each Bank, (a) extend the scheduled maturities (including the final maturity
and any mandatory prepayments) of any Loan or any portion thereof, or reduce the
rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or fees hereunder or
reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the Commitment of any Bank over
the amount thereof then in effect, (b) amend, modify or waive any provision of
this Section, (c) reduce any percentage specified in, or otherwise modify, the
definition of Majority Banks, (d) consent to the assignment or transfer by the
Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under (or in respect of) this Loan
Agreement or (e) modify the definition of "Termination Date". No provision of
Article IX may be amended without the consent of the Agent.

         10.7     COUNTERPARTS.

         This Loan Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in
making proof of this Loan Agreement to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart.

         10.10    CALCULATIONS; COMPUTATIONS.

                  (a)      The financial statements furnished to the Banks
         pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in accordance with generally

         payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day together
         with, in the case of a payment of principal, interest thereon to the
         date of payment (except in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the next
         succeeding Business Day is in a different calendar month, then on the
         next preceding Business Day).

         10.11    GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

                  (a)      THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND
         THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER
         SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
         THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE. Any legal action or proceeding with
         respect to this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document may be
         brought in the courts of the State of Tennessee in Davidson County, or
         of the United States for the Middle District of Tennessee, and, by
         execution and delivery of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower hereby
         irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property,
         generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of such courts. The
         Borrower further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of
         any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by
         the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage
         prepaid, to the Borrower at its address for notices set forth beneath
         its signature, such service to become effective 30 days after such
         mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Banks to serve
         process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal
         proceedings or to otherwise proceed against the Borrower in any other
         jurisdiction.

                  (b)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection
         which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the
         aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with
         this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document brought in the courts
         referred to in subsection (a) hereof and hereby further irrevocably
         waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
         action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
         inconvenient forum.

                  (c)      THE BORROWER AND EACH BANK HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
         TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
         ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
         THIS LOAN AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE
         TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

         10.12    SEVERABILITY.

         If any provision of any of the Loan Documents is determined to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable and
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions.

         10.13    ENTIRETY.

         This Loan Agreement together with the other Loan Documents represent
the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any, including any commitment
letters or correspondence relating to the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated herein and therein.

         10.14    SURVIVAL.

         All representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein shall
survive delivery of the Notes and the making of the Loans and the issuance of
the Letters of Credit hereunder.

         10.15    PRO RATA, SHARING.

         Each Bank agrees that, if it should receive any amount hereunder
(whether voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the
right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the
enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or otherwise) which is
applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest or fees on, the Loans
or the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower in connection with Letters of
Credit, of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by the
other Banks is in a greater proportion than the total of such obligation than
owned and due to such Bank bears to the total of such obligation prior to such
receipt, then such Bank receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash
without recourse or warranty from the other Banks an interest in the


<PAGE>   73
                                                                         Page 73


obligations of the Borrower to such Banks in such amount as will result in a
proportional participation by all of the Banks in such amount, provided that if
all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Bank,
such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent
of such recovery, but without interest.

         10.16    INDEMNITY.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Borrower agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each Agent-Related
Person, each Bank and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the
"Indemnitees") from and against: (a) any and all claims, demands, actions or
causes of action that are asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (other
than the Agent or any Bank) relating directly or indirectly to a claim, demand,
action or cause of action that such Person asserts or may assert against the
Borrower, any Affiliate of the Borrower or any of its respective officers or
directors; (b) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action that may
at any time (including at any time following repayment of the Obligations and
the resignation or removal of the Agent or the replacement of any Bank) be
asserted or imposed against any Indemnitee, arising out of or relating to, the
Loan Documents, any predecessor Loan Documents, the Commitments, the use or
contemplated use of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit, or the
relationship of the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks under this Loan Agreement
or any other Loan Document; (c) any administrative or investigative proceeding
by any governmental authority arising out of or related to a claim, demand,
action or cause of action described in subsection (a) or (b) above; and (d) any
and all liabilities (including liabilities under indemnities), losses, costs or
expenses (including reasonable fees and costs of counsel) that any Indemnitee
suffers or incurs as a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand,
action, cause of action or proceeding, or as a result of the preparation of any
defense in connection with any foregoing claim, demand, action, cause of action
or proceeding, in all cases, whether or not arising out of the negligence of an
Indemnitee, and whether or not an Indemnitee is a party to such claim, demand,
action, cause of action or proceeding (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification for any claim caused by its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct or for any loss asserted against it by another Indemnitee. The
agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments and
repayment of all the other Obligations.

         10.17    CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each of the Agent and the Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality
of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood
that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Loan Agreement; (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the

                                                                         Page 74


enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section or so long
as such Person has agreed to be bound by the terms of this Section 10.17, to (i)
any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee
of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Loan Agreement
or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective
counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's
professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to
obligations of the Borrower; (g) with the consent of the Borrower; (h) to the
extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of
a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Agent or any Bank on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (i) to the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar
organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to
information about a Bank's or its Affiliates' investment portfolio in connection
with ratings issued with respect to such Bank or its Affiliates. For the
purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the
Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

except to the extent that the federal laws of the United States of America are

         8.       The Loan Agreement; and

         9.       Each of the Notes;

         The documents referenced in 1 through 7 above are collectively referred
to herein as the "Certificates." The documents referenced in 8 and 9 above are
collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents."

         For the purpose of issuing this letter, we have assumed (i) the
genuineness of all signatures on documents we have reviewed, other than those of
Borrower, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals,
(iii) the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted
to us as certified, conformed, or photostatic copies, and (iv) regarding
documents executed by parties other than Borrower, we have assumed that the
other parties have the due power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
under such documents, the due execution of the same by such other parties and
that such documents are the binding and enforceable obligations of such other
parties. We have further relied upon the Certificates as to matters set forth
therein.

         Our opinions herein are limited to matters of Tennessee law and the
federal laws of the United States of America.

         Opinions stated to our knowledge reflect only that our attorneys
materially engaged in this transaction have no actual present awareness to the
contrary, following inquiry made of the Borrower but no further diligence or
inquiry whatsoever on our part, except as may be specifically described.

         Based on the foregoing, but subject to the additional limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth below, it is our opinion that:

         1.       Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Genesco
Netherlands B.V.) has been duly organized and is validly existing as a
corporation under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, with
corporate and authority to own its properties and conduct its business in the
ordinary course.

         2.       Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Genesco
Netherlands B.V.) is duly licensed or qualified as a corporation authorized to
transact business and is in good standing in each foreign jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned by it or the nature of the business
transacted by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary. Neither the
Borrower nor its Subsidiaries (other than Genesco Netherlands B.V.) are subject
to any material liability or disability by reason of failure to be so qualified
or licensed in any such jurisdiction. For purposes of this opinion, we have
relied exclusively without further investigation, with your consent, on the
Certificates.

         3.       The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Borrower, and the provisions of the Loan Documents are valid and binding
obligations of Borrower enforceable in accordance with their terms.


<PAGE>   91

         4.       To our knowledge, the Loan Documents to which Borrower is a
party (a) will not violate any Requirement of Law or contractual obligation of
Borrower in any respect that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, (b) will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any properties or revenues of Borrower pursuant to any such
Requirement of Law or contractual obligation, and (c) will not violate or
conflict with any provision of Borrower's articles of incorporation or by-laws.

         5.       No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or
other similar act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or, to our
knowledge, any other Person is required to be obtained or made by or on behalf
of Borrower in connection with the borrowings under the Loan Documents or with
the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of the Loan
Documents to which the Borrower is a party.

         6.       To our knowledge and except as set forth in the financial
statements described in section 5.3 of the Loan Agreement, there are no actions,
suits or proceedings pending or threatened against or affecting Borrower, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its properties before any Governmental Authority that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of
this opinion, we have relied exclusively without further investigation, with
your consent, on the Certificates.

         7.       To our knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending or threatened against or affecting Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its properties before any Governmental Authority that in any manner draws
into question the validity, legality or enforceability of any Loan Document or
any transaction contemplated thereby.

         8.       The Loan Documents expressly provide that the terms and
provisions thereof will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Tennessee. Tennessee law recognizes the right of parties to a
contract to elect the application of laws of a particular state or nation to
govern the validity and construction of a contract, as long as the forum
selected bears a "reasonable relation" to the transaction. The existence of a
"reasonable relation" is an issue of fact. Numerous factors are relevant to this
inquiry including the place of negotiation, delivery and execution of the Loan
Documents and the location of the parties to the transaction contemplated
thereby. We have been advised, and assumed without independent verification for
purposes of issuing the opinion contained in this paragraph, that (i) the
principal place of business of Borrower is in Tennessee, (ii) the Loan Documents
have been negotiated by Borrower in Tennessee, and (iii) the Loan Documents have
been executed and delivered by Borrower in Tennessee. These factors should be
sufficient to support the finding of a reasonable relationship between the
transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents and Tennessee. We note that
choice-of-law provisions may not be upheld in the State to enforce provisions
that, at the time of attempted enforcement, violate a fundamental public policy
of the State and that choice-of-law elections may not be observed by courts of
the State with respect to tort actions and other actions not sounding in
contract that might arise in connection with the transaction contemplated by the
Loan Documents.

         The opinions expressed above are further subject to the following
qualifications, limitations and assumptions:


<PAGE>   92

         (a)      The opinions set forth above, insofar as they relate to the
enforceability of the Loan Documents, are subject to the effect of bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights (including, without limitation,
preference and fraudulent conveyance or transfer laws).

         (b)      Certain waivers and remedies included in the Loan Documents
may be subject to additional limitations; however, the statutes and judicial
decisions giving rise to any such limitations do not affect the overall validity
of the Loan Documents or impair the validity of the debt obligations provided
for therein or otherwise interfere with the practical realization of the
principal benefits reasonably intended to be provided by the Loan Documents.

         (c)      We express no opinion as to the effect of Tennessee laws
regulating or limiting in any fashion calculation, payment or collection of late
charges, commitment fees, prepayment penalties or other loan charges or fees,
however denominated.

         (d)      The unenforceability under certain circumstances, under
Tennessee statutes or court decisions, of provisions indemnifying or
prospectively releasing a party against liability for its own wrongful or
negligent acts or where the release or indemnification is contrary to public
policy.

         (e)      The binding effect and enforceability of the Loan Documents
and the availability of injunctive relief or other equitable remedies thereunder
are subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in proceedings at law or in equity).

         (f)      The possible ineffectiveness of any waiver of trial by jury,
agreement for acceptance of process by mail or forum selection provision.

         (g)      To the extent that matters covered by such opinion would be
governed by laws other than the laws of the State of Tennessee and the federal
laws of the United States of America, we have assumed that such laws are
identical to those of the State of Tennessee.

         Whenever our opinion herein with respect to the existence or absence of
facts is indicated to be based on our knowledge, it is intended to signify that
no lawyer in the firm who has given substantive legal attention to the
representation of Borrower in connection with the transaction which is the
subject of this opinion has any actual conscious awareness of facts or
information to indicate otherwise. Except to the extent expressly set forth
herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the
existence or absence of such facts, and no inference as to our knowledge of the
existence or absence of such facts should be drawn from our representation of
Borrower.

         We expressly disclaim any responsibility for advising you of any change
occurring hereafter in circumstances concerning the transaction which is the
subject of this letter, including any changes in the law or in factual matters
occurring after the date of this letter. Your acceptance of this letter shall
constitute your acknowledgment that you have not relied upon any representation
on our part in this transaction beyond the specific matters set forth herein.

         This letter is furnished only to the Administrative Agent and the Banks
and is solely for their benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Loan Documents; provided, however, this opinion may be relied upon by any
assignee who becomes a Lender under the Credit Agreement in compliance with
Section 10.3 of the Loan Agreement. This opinion is not to be used, circulated,
quoted or otherwise relied upon by any other person or entity or, for any other
purpose, without our prior written consent.

                                                     Sincerely yours,
