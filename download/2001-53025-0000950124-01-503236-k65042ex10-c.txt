ARTICLE II. THE REVOLVING CREDIT

         2.1. ESTABLISHMENT OF REVOLVING CREDIT.

         (a)      The Revolving Credit Lenders hereby establish a revolving line
of credit in the Borrowers' favor pursuant to which each Revolving Credit
Lender, subject to, and in accordance with, this Agreement, acting through the
Agent, shall make loans and advances and otherwise provide financial
accommodations to and for the account of the Borrowers as provided herein.

         (b)      Loans, advances, and financial accommodations under the
Revolving Credit shall be made with reference to the Borrowing Base and shall be
subject to Availability. The Borrowing Base and Availability shall be determined
by the Agent by reference to Borrowing Base Certificates furnished as provided
in Section 5.4, below, and shall be subject to the following:

                  (i)   Such determination shall take into account such Reserves
         as the Agent may determine as being applicable thereto.

                  (ii)  The Cost of Eligible Inventory will be determined in a
         manner consistent with current tracking practices, based on such
         Borrower's stock ledger inventory.

                  (iii) The Cost of Eligible L/C Inventory will be calculated at
         the Cost of such Inventory.

         (c)      The commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender to provide such
loans, advances, and financial accommodations is subject to Section 2.22.

         (d)      The proceeds of borrowings under the Revolving Credit shall be
used to refinance existing senior bank facilities and to fund general corporate
purposes, including, without limitation, the Company's working capital
requirements, Capital Expenditures, permitted repurchases of 6.75% Senior
Unsecured Notes, the issuance of L/Cs, permitted dividend distributions, and as
otherwise permitted by this Agreement. No proceeds of a borrowing under the
Revolving Credit may be used, nor shall any be requested, with a view towards
the accumulation of any general fund or funded reserve of the Borrowers other
than in the ordinary course of the Borrowers' businesses and consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement.

         2.2. ADVANCES CAUSING AVAILABILITY TO BE LESS THAN MINIMUM AVAILABILITY
(OVERLOANS).

         (a)      No Revolving Credit Lender has any obligation to make any loan
or advance, or otherwise to provide any credit to or for the benefit of the
Borrowers where the result of such loan, advance, or credit is an OverLoan.

<PAGE>   33
                                      -25-


         (b)      The Revolving Credit Lenders' obligations, among themselves,
are subject to Section 12.3(a) (which relates to each Revolving Credit Lender's
making amounts available to the Agent) and to Section 15.3(a) (which relates to
Protective OverAdvances).

         (c)      The Revolving Credit Lenders' providing of an OverLoan on any
one occasion does not affect the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder
(including any Borrower's obligation to immediately repay any amount which
otherwise constitutes an OverLoan) nor obligate the Revolving Credit Lenders to
do so on any other occasion.

         2.3. RISKS OF VALUE OF COLLATERAL. The Agent's reference to a given
asset in connection with the making of loans, credits, and advances and the
providing of financial accommodations under the Revolving Credit and/or the
monitoring of compliance with the provisions hereof shall not be deemed a
determination by the Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender relative to the actual
value of the asset in question. All risks concerning the value of the Collateral
are and remain upon each Borrower. All Collateral secures the prompt, punctual,
and faithful performance of the Liabilities whether or not relied upon by the
Agent in connection with the making of loans, credits, and advances and the
providing of financial accommodations under the Revolving Credit.

         2.4. COMMITMENT TO MAKE REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS AND SUPPORT LETTERS OF
CREDIT. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit
Lenders shall make a loan or advance under the Revolving Credit and the Agent
shall endeavor to have an L/C issued for the account of the applicable Borrower,
in each instance if duly and timely requested by the Company as provided herein
provided that:

                  (i)      No OverLoan is then outstanding and none will result
                           therefrom.

                  (ii)     The Revolving Credit has not been suspended (as to
         which, see in Section 2.5(g)).

         2.5. REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN REQUESTS.

         (a)      Requests for loans and advances under the Revolving Credit or
for the continuance or conversion of an interest rate applicable to a Revolving
Credit Loan may be requested by the Company in the form attached as EXHIBIT F or
in such other manner as may from time to time be acceptable to the Agent.

         (b)      Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company, on
behalf of any Borrower, may request a Revolving Credit Loan and elect an
interest rate and Interest Period to be applicable to that Revolving Credit Loan
by giving notice to the Agent by no later than the following:

                  (i)   If such Revolving Credit Loan is to be or is to be
         converted to a Base Margin Loan: By 12:00 noon on the Business Day on
         which the subject Revolving Credit Loan is to be made or is to be so
         converted. Base Margin

<PAGE>   34

                                      -26-

         Loans requested by the Company, other than those resulting from the
         conversion of a Eurodollar Loan, shall not be less than $10,000.00.

                  (ii)  If such Revolving Credit Loan is to be, or is to be
         continued as, or converted to, a Eurodollar Loan: By 1:00PM two (2)
         Eurodollar Business Days before the commencement of any new Interest
         Period or the end of the then applicable Interest Period. Eurodollar
         Loans and conversions to Eurodollar Loans shall each be not less than
         $1,000,000 and in increments of $1,000,000 in excess of such minimum.

                  (iii) Any Eurodollar Loan which matures while the Borrowers
         are InDefault shall be converted, at the option of the Agent, to a Base
         Margin Loan notwithstanding any notice from any Borrower that such Loan
         is to be continued as a Eurodollar Loan.

         (c)      Any request for a Revolving Credit Loan or for the continuance
or conversion of an interest rate applicable to a Revolving Credit Loan which is
made after the applicable deadline therefor, as set forth above, shall be deemed
to have been made at the opening of business on the then next Business Day or
Eurodollar Business Day, as applicable.

         (d)      The Company may request that the Agent cause the issuance by
the Issuer of L/C's for the account of any Borrower as provided in Section 2.18.

         (e)      The Agent may rely on any request for a loan or advance, or
other financial accommodation under the Revolving Credit which the Agent, in
good faith, believes to have been made by a Person duly authorized to act on
behalf of the Borrowers and may decline to make any such requested loan or
advance, or issuance, or to provide any such financial accommodation pending the
Agent's being furnished with such documentation concerning that Person's
authority to act as may be satisfactory to the Agent.

         (f)      A request by the Company for loan or advance, or other
financial accommodation under the Revolving Credit shall be irrevocable and
shall constitute certification by the Borrowers that as of the date of such
request, each of the following is true and correct:

                  (i)   There has been no material adverse change in any
         Borrower's financial condition from the most recent financial
         information furnished Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to
         this Agreement.

                  (ii)  All or a portion of any loan or advance so requested
         will be set aside by such Borrower to cover such Borrower's obligations
         for any unpaid sales tax on account of sales since the then most recent
         borrowing pursuant to the Revolving Credit.
<PAGE>   35
                                      -27-


                  (iii) Each representation which is made herein or in any of
         the Loan Documents is then true and complete in all material respects
         as of and as if made on the date of such request.

                  (iv)  Unless accompanied by a written Certificate of such
         Borrower's President or its Chief Financial Officer describing (in
         reasonable detail) the facts and circumstances thereof and the steps
         (if any) being taken to remedy such condition, that such Borrower is
         not InDefault.

         (g)      If, at any time or from time to time, any Borrower is
InDefault:

                  (i)   The Agent may suspend the Revolving Credit immediately,
         in which event, neither the Agent nor any Revolving Credit Lender shall
         be obligated, during such suspension, to make any loans or advance, or
         to provide any financial accommodation hereunder or to seek the
         issuance of any L/C.

                  (ii)  The Agent may suspend the right of any Borrower to
         request any Eurodollar Loan or to convert any Base Margin Loan to a
         Eurodollar Loan.

         2.6. MAKING OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

         (a)      A loan or advance under the Revolving Credit shall be made by
the transfer of the proceeds of such loan or advance to the Operating Account or
as otherwise instructed by the Company.

         (b)      A loan or advance shall be deemed to have been made under the
Revolving Credit (and the Borrowers shall be indebted to the Agent and the
Revolving Credit Lenders for the amount thereof immediately) at the following:

                  (i)   The Agent's initiation of the transfer of the proceeds
         of such loan or advance in accordance with the Company's instructions
         (if such loan or advance is of funds requested by the Company).

                  (ii)  The charging of the amount of such loan to the Loan
         Account (in all other circumstances).

         (c)      There shall not be any recourse to or liability of the Agent
or any Revolving Credit Lender, on account of:

                  (i)   Any delay in the making of any loan or advance requested
         under the Revolving Credit.

                  (ii)  Any delay by any bank or other depository institution in
         treating the proceeds of any such loan or advance as collected funds.

                  (iii) Any delay in the receipt, and/or any loss, of funds
         which constitute a loan or advance under the Revolving Credit, the wire
         transfer of which was

<PAGE>   36

                                      -28-

         properly initiated by the Agent in accordance with wire instructions
         provided to the Agent by the Company.

         2.7. SWINGLINE LOANS.

         (a)      For ease of administration, Base Margin Loans may be made by
the SwingLine Lender (in the aggregate, the "SWINGLINE LOANS") in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Agreement for the making of loans and
advances under the Revolving Credit. The unpaid principal balance of the
SwingLine Loans shall not at any one time be in excess of the SwingLine Loan
Ceiling.

         (b)      The aggregate unpaid principal balance of SwingLine Loans
shall bear interest at the rate applicable to Base Margin Loans and shall be
repayable as a loan under the Revolving Credit.

         (c)      The Borrowers' obligation to repay SwingLine Loans shall be
evidenced by a Note in the form of EXHIBIT A (the "SWINGLINE NOTE"), annexed
hereto, executed by each Borrower, and payable to the SwingLine Lender. Neither
the original nor a copy of that Note shall be required, however, to establish or
prove any Liability. Each Borrower shall execute a replacement of any SwingLine
Note which has been lost, mutilated, or destroyed thereof and deliver such
replacement to the SwingLine Lender.

         (d)      For all purposes of this Loan Agreement, the SwingLine Loans
and the Borrowers' obligations to the SwingLine Lender constitute Revolving
Credit Loans and are secured as "Liabilities".

         (e)      SwingLine Loans may be subject to periodic settlement with the
Revolving Credit Lenders as provided in this Agreement.

         2.8. THE LOAN ACCOUNT.

the Agent in which a record shall be kept of all loans and advances made under
the Revolving Credit.

         (b)      The Agent shall also keep a record (either in the Loan Account
or elsewhere, as the Agent may from time to time elect) of all interest, fees,
service charges, costs, expenses, and other debits owed to the Agent and each
Revolving Credit Lender on account of the Liabilities and of all credits against
such amounts so owed.

         (c)      All credits against the Liabilities shall be conditional upon
final payment to the Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender of
the items giving rise to such credits. The amount of any item credited against
the Liabilities which is charged back against the Agent or any Revolving Credit
Lender for any reason or is not so paid shall be a Liability and shall be added
to the Loan Account, whether or not the item so charged back or not so paid is
returned.
<PAGE>   37
                                      -29-


         (d)      Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees, service
charges, costs, and expenses for which any Borrower is obligated hereunder are
payable on demand. In the determination of Availability, the Agent may deem
accrued interest which will be due and payable between the date of such
determination and the first day of the then next succeeding month as having been
advanced under the Revolving Credit whether or not such amounts are then due and
payable.

         (e)      The Agent, without the request of any Borrower, may advance
under the Revolving Credit any interest, fee, service charge, or other payment
to which the Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender is entitled from any Borrower
pursuant hereto and may charge the same to the Loan Account notwithstanding that
an OverLoan may result thereby. Such action on the part of the Agent shall not
constitute a waiver of the Agent's rights and any Borrower's obligations under
Section 2.10(b). Any amount which is added to the principal balance of the Loan
Account as provided in this Section 2.8(e) shall bear interest at the interest
rate then and thereafter applicable to Base Margin Loans.

         (f)      Any statement rendered by the Agent or any Revolving Credit
Lender to the Company concerning the Liabilities shall be considered correct and
accepted by each Borrowers and shall be conclusively binding upon each Borrower
unless the Borrowers provides the Agent with written objection thereto within
thirty (30) days from the mailing of such statement, which written objection
shall indicate, with particularity, the reason for such objection. The Loan
Account and the Agent's books and records concerning the loan arrangement
contemplated herein and the Liabilities shall be prima facie evidence and proof
of the items described therein.

         2.9. THE REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES. Each Borrower's obligation to repay
loans and advances under the Revolving Credit, with interest as provided herein,
shall be evidenced by Notes (each, a "REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE") in the form of
EXHIBIT B, annexed hereto, executed by each Borrower, one payable to each
Revolving Credit Lender. Neither the original nor a copy of any Revolving Credit
Note shall be required, however, to establish or prove any Liability. In the
event that any Revolving Credit Note is ever lost, mutilated, or destroyed, each
Borrower shall execute a replacement thereof and deliver such replacement to the
Agent.

         2.10. PAYMENT OF THE LOAN ACCOUNT.

         (a)      The Borrowers may repay all or any portion of the principal
balance of the Loan Account from time to time until the Termination Date.

         (b)      The Borrowers, without notice or demand from the Agent or any
Revolving Credit Lender, shall pay the Agent that amount, from time to time,
which is necessary so that there is no OverLoan outstanding.

         (c)      The Borrowers shall repay the then entire unpaid balance of
the Loan Account and all other Liabilities on the Termination Date.

<PAGE>   38

                                      -30-

         (d)      The Agent shall endeavor to cause the application of payments
(if any), pursuant to Sections 2.10(a) and 2.10(b) against Eurodollar Loans then
outstanding in such manner as results in the least cost to the Borrowers, but
shall not have any affirmative obligation to do so nor liability on account of
the Agent's failure to have done so. In no event shall action or inaction taken
by the Agent excuse any Borrower from any indemnification obligation under
Section 2.10(e).

         (e)      Each Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Revolving
Credit Lender and hold the Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender harmless from
and against any loss, cost or expense (including loss of anticipated profits and
amounts payable by the Agent or such Revolving Credit Lender on account of
"breakage fees" (so-called)) which the Agent or such Revolving Credit Lender may
sustain or incur (including, without limitation, by virtue of acceleration after
the occurrence of any Event of Default) as a consequence of the following:

                  (i)   Default by any Borrower in payment of the principal
         amount of or any interest on any Eurodollar Loan as and when due and
         payable, including any such loss or expense arising from interest or
         fees payable by such Revolving Credit Lender in order to maintain its
         Eurodollar Loans.

                  (ii)  Default by any Borrower in making a borrowing or
         conversion after the Company has given (or is deemed to have given) a
         request for a Revolving Credit Loan or a request to convert a Revolving
         Credit Loan from one applicable interest rate to another.

                  (iii) The making of any payment on a Eurodollar Loan or the
         making of any conversion of any such Loan to a Base Margin Loan on a
         day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period with
         respect thereto.

         2.11. INTEREST ON REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

         (a)      Each Revolving Credit Loan shall bear interest at the Base
Margin Rate unless timely notice is given (as provided in Section 2.5) that the
subject Revolving Credit Loan (or a portion thereof) is, or is to be converted
to, a Eurodollar Loan.

         (b)      Each Revolving Credit Loan which consists of a Eurodollar Loan
shall bear interest at the applicable Eurodollar Rate.

         (c)      Subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company may cause all or a part of the unpaid principal balance
of the Loan Account to bear interest at the Base Margin Rate or the Eurodollar
Rate as specified from time to time by the Company.

         (d)      No Borrower shall select, renew, or convert any interest rate
for a Revolving Credit Loan such that, in addition to interest at the Base
Margin Rate, there are more than five (5) Eurodollar Rates applicable to the
Revolving Credit Loans at any one time.
<PAGE>   39

         (e)      Each Borrower shall pay accrued and unpaid interest on each
Revolving Credit Loan in arrears as follows:

                  (i)   On the applicable Interest Payment Date for that
         Revolving Credit Loan.

                  (ii)  On the Termination Date and on the End Date.

                  (iii) Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, with
         such frequency as may be determined by the Agent.

         (f)      Following the occurrence of any Event of Default (and whether
or not the Agent exercises the Agent's rights on account thereof), all Revolving
Credit Loans shall bear interest, at the option of the Agent or at the
instruction of the SuperMajority Lenders at rate which is the aggregate of the
rate applicable to Base Margin Loans plus Two Percent (2%) per annum.

         2.12. CLOSING FEE. In consideration of the commitment to make loans and
advances to the Borrowers under the Revolving Credit, and to maintain sufficient
funds available for such purpose, there has been earned and the Borrowers shall
pay to the Agent the "CLOSING FEE" (so referred to herein) as set forth in the
Fee Letter.

         2.13. AGENT'S FEE. In addition to any other fee or expense to be paid
by the Borrowers on account of the Revolving Credit, the Borrowers shall pay the
Agent the "AGENT'S FEE" as set forth in the fee letter.

         2.14. UNUSED LINE FEE. In addition to any other fee to be paid by the
Borrowers on account of the Revolving Credit, the Borrowers shall pay the Agent
the "UNUSED LINE FEE" (so referred to herein) of 0.50% per annum of the average
difference, during the quarter most recently ended (or relevant period with
respect to the payment being made on the Termination Date) between the Revolving
Credit Ceiling and the aggregate of the unpaid principal balance of the Loan
Account and the undrawn Stated Amount of L/C's outstanding during the relevant
period. The Unused Line Fee shall be paid in arrears, on the first day of each
quarter after the execution of this Agreement and on the Termination Date.

         2.15. EARLY TERMINATION FEE.

         (a)      In the event that the Termination Date occurs, for any reason
(other than because the End Date occurs as a result of funds borrowed from FRFI,
Fleet National Bank or any of their Affiliates), prior to the Maturity Date, the
Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Credit
Lenders, the "REVOLVING CREDIT EARLY TERMINATION FEE" (so referred to herein)
determined and payable as follows:

                  (i)   $1,500,000 if the Termination Date occurs on or before
         the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement.
<PAGE>   40
                                      -32-


                  (ii)  $750,000 if the Termination Date occurs after the first
         anniversary of the date of this Agreement but on or before the second
         anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

                  (iii) $0 at all times after the second anniversary of the date
         of this Agreement.

         (b)      The Revolving Credit Early Termination Fee shall be allocated
to the Revolving Credit Lenders pro rata based upon their Revolving Credit
Dollar Commitment.

         2.16. CONCERNING FEES.

         (a)      In addition to any other right to which the Agent is then
entitled on account thereof, the Agent may assess an additional fee payable by
any Borrower on account of the accommodation, from time to time, by the Agent of
any Borrower's request that the Agent depart or dispense with one or more of the
administrative provisions of this Agreement and/or any Borrower's failure to
comply with any of such provisions.

                  (i)      By way of non-exclusive example, the Agent may assess
         a  fee on account of any of the following:

                           (A) Any Borrower's failure to pay that amount which
                  is necessary so that no OverLoan is outstanding (as required
                  under Section 2.10(b) hereof).

                           (B) The providing of a loan or advance under the
                  Revolving Credit or charging of the Loan Account such that an
                  OverLoan is made.

                           (C) The foreshortening of any of the time frames with
                  respect to the making of Revolving Credit Loans as set forth
                  in Section 2.5.

                           (D) Any Borrower's failure to provide a financial
                  statement or report within the applicable time frame provided
                  for such report under Article 5: hereof.

                  (ii)     The inclusion of the foregoing right on the part of
         the Agent to assess a fee does not constitute an obligation, on the
         part of the Agent, to waive any provision of this Agreement under any
         circumstances. The assessment of any such fee in any particular
         circumstance shall not constitute the Agent's waiver of any breach of
         this Agreement on account of which such fee was assessed nor a course
         of action on which any Borrower may rely.

         (b)      No Borrower shall be entitled to any credit, rebate or
repayment of any fee earned by the Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender pursuant
to this Agreement or any Loan Document notwithstanding any termination of this
Agreement or suspension or
<PAGE>   41
                                      -33-


termination of the Agent's and any Revolving Credit Lender's respective
obligation to make loans and advances hereunder.

         2.17. AGENT'S AND REVOLVING CREDIT LENDERS' DISCRETION.

         (a)   Each reference in the Loan Documents to the exercise of
discretion or the like by the Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender shall be to
such Person's exercise of its judgment, in good faith (which shall be presumed),
based upon such Person's consideration of any such factors as the Agent or that
Revolving Credit Lender, taking into account information of which that Person
then has actual knowledge, believes:

                  (i)   Will or reasonably could be expected to affect the value
         of the Collateral, the enforceability of the Agent's Collateral
         Interests therein, or the amount which the Agent would likely realize
         therefrom (taking into account delays which may possibly be encountered
         in the Agent's realizing upon the Collateral and likely Costs of
         Collection).

                  (ii)  Indicates that any report or financial information
         delivered to the Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender by or on behalf
         of any Borrower is incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading in any
         material manner or was not prepared in accordance with the requirements
         of this Agreement.

                  (iii) Suggests an increase in the likelihood that any Borrower
         will become the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

                  (iv)  Suggests that any Borrower is InDefault.

         (b) In the exercise of such judgement, the Agent and each Revolving
Credit Lender also may take into account any of the following factors:

                  (i)   Those included in, or tested by, the definitions of
         "Eligible Inventory" and "Cost".

                  (ii)  The current financial and business climate of the
         industry in which any Borrower competes (having regard for such
         Borrower's position in that industry).

                  (iii) General macroeconomic conditions which have a material
         effect on any Borrower's cost structure or the value of Eligible Real
         Estate Assets.

                  (iv)  Material changes in or to the mix of any Borrower's
         Inventory.

                  (v)   Seasonality with respect to any Borrower's Inventory and
         patterns of retail sales.
<PAGE>   42

                                      -34-

                  (vi)  Such other factors as the Agent and each Revolving
         Credit Lender reasonably determines as having a material bearing on
         credit risks associated with the providing of loans and financial
         accommodations to any Borrower.

         (c)      The burden of establishing the failure of the Agent or any
Revolving Credit Lender to have acted in a reasonable manner in such Person's
exercise of such discretion shall be the Borrowers' and may be made only by
clear and convincing evidence.

         2.18. PROCEDURES FOR ISSUANCE OF L/C'S.

         (a)      The Company may request that the Agent cause the issuance by
the Issuer of L/C's for the account of the Borrowers. Each such request shall be
in such manner as may from time to time be acceptable to the Agent.

         (b)      The Agent will endeavor to cause the issuance of any L/C so
requested by the Company, provided that, at the time that the request is made,
the Revolving Credit has not been suspended as provided in Section 2.5(g) and if
so issued:

                  (i)   The aggregate Stated Amount of all L/C's then
         outstanding, does not exceed Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000).

                  (ii)  The expiry of the L/C is not later than the following:

                        (A)      Standby's: One (1) year from initial issuance.

                        (B)      Documentary's: Sixty (60) days from issuance.

                  (iii) If the expiry of an L/C is later than the Maturity Date,
         the Agent may require such L/C to be 103% cash collateralized at its
         issuance.

                  (iv)  An OverLoan will not result from the issuance of the
         subject L/C.

         (c)      Such Borrower shall execute such documentation to apply for
and support the issuance of an L/C as may be required by the Issuer.

         (d)      There shall not be any recourse to, nor liability of, the
Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender on account of

                  (i)   Any delay or refusal by an Issuer to issue an L/C;

                  (ii)  Any action or inaction of an Issuer on account of or in
         respect to, any L/C, except for such Issuer's gross negligence or
         willful misconduct.

         (e)      The Borrowers shall reimburse the Issuer for the amount of any
honoring of a drawing under an L/C on the same day on which such honoring takes
place. The Agent, without the request of any Borrower, may advance under the
Revolving Credit (and charge to the Loan Account) the amount of any honoring of
any L/C and other

<PAGE>   43
                                      -35-


amount for which such Borrower, the Issuer, or the Revolving Credit Lenders
become obligated on account of, or in respect to, any L/C. Such advance shall be
made whether or not such Borrower is InDefault or such advance would result in
an OverLoan. Such action shall not constitute a waiver of the Agent's rights
under Section 2.10(b) hereof.

         2.19. FEES FOR L/C'S.

         (a)      The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent a fee, on account of
L/C's, the issuance of which had been procured by the Agent, quarterly in
arrears, and on the Termination Date and on the End Date, equal to:

                  (i)   The Eurodollar Applicable Margin on account of standby
         letters of credit.

                  (ii)  The Eurodollar Applicable Margin minus 50 basis points
         on account of documentary letters of credit.

                  (iii) Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, such
         fee shall be increased by two percent (2%) per annum.

         (b)      In addition to the fee to be paid as provided in Subsection
2.19(a), above, the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent (or to the Issuer, if so
requested by Agent), on demand, all issuance, processing, negotiation,
amendment, and administrative fees and other amounts charged by the Issuer on
account of, or in respect to, any L/C.

         (c)      If any change in Applicable Law shall either:

                  (i)   impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirements against letters of credit heretofore or
         hereafter issued by any Issuer or with respect to which any Revolving
         Credit Lender or any Issuer has an obligation to lend to fund drawings
         under any L/C; or

                  (ii)  impose on any Issuer any other condition or requirements
         relating to any such letters of credit;

and the result of any event referred to in Section 2.19(c)(i) or 2.19(c)(ii),
above, shall be to increase the cost to any Revolving Credit Lender or to any
Issuer of issuing or maintaining any L/C (which increase in cost shall be the
result of such Issuer's reasonable allocation among that Revolving Credit
Lender's or Issuer's letter of credit customers of the aggregate of such cost
increases resulting from such events), then, upon demand by the Agent and
delivery by the Agent to the Company of a certificate of an officer of the
subject Revolving Credit Lender or the subject Issuer describing such change in
law, executive order, regulation, directive, or interpretation thereof, its
effect on such Revolving Credit Lender or such Issuer, and the basis for
determining such increased costs and their allocation, the Borrowers shall
immediately pay to the Agent, from time to time as specified by the Agent, such
amounts as shall be sufficient to

<PAGE>   44
                                      -36-


compensate the subject Revolving Credit Lender or the subject Issuer for such
increased cost. Any Revolving Credit Lender's or any Issuer's determination of
costs incurred under Section 2.19(c)(i) or 2.19(c)(ii), above, and the
allocation, if any, of such costs among the Borrowers and other letter of credit
customers of such Revolving Credit Lender or such Issuer, if done in good faith
and made on an equitable basis and in accordance with such officer's
certificate, shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers.

         2.20. CONCERNING L/C'S.

         (a)      None of the Issuer, the Issuer's correspondents, any Revolving
Credit Lender, the Agent, or any advising, negotiating, or paying bank with
respect to any L/C shall be responsible in any way for:

                  (i)   The performance by any beneficiary under any L/C of that
         beneficiary's obligations to any Borrower.

                  (ii)  The form, sufficiency, correctness, genuineness,
         authority of any person signing; falsification; or the legal effect of;
         any documents called for under any L/C if (with respect to the
         foregoing) such documents on their face appear to be in order.

         (b)      The Issuer may honor, as complying with the terms of any L/C
and of any drawing thereunder, any drafts or other documents otherwise in order,
but signed or issued by an administrator, executor, conservator, trustee in
bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
liquidator, receiver, or other legal representative of the party authorized
under such L/C to draw or issue such drafts or other documents.

         (c)      Unless otherwise agreed to, in the particular instance, each
Borrower hereby authorizes any Issuer to:

                  (i)   Select an advising bank, if any.

                  (ii)  Select a paying bank, if any.

                  (iii) Select a negotiating bank.

         (d)      All directions, correspondence, and funds transfers relating
to any L/C are at the risk of such Borrower. The Issuer shall have discharged
the Issuer's obligations under any L/C which, or the drawing under which,
includes payment instructions, by the initiation of the method of payment called
for in, and in accordance with, such instructions (or by any other commercially
reasonable and comparable method). None of the Agent, any Revolving Credit
Lender, or the Issuer shall have any responsibility for any inaccuracy,
interruption, error, or delay in transmission or delivery by post, telegraph or
cable, or for any inaccuracy of translation.
<PAGE>   45

                                      -37-

         (e)      The Agent's, each Revolving Credit Lender's, and the Issuer's
rights, powers, privileges and immunities specified in or arising under this
Agreement are in addition to any heretofore or at any time hereafter otherwise
created or arising, whether by statute or rule of law or contract.

         (f)      Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided hereunder or
agreed to in writing by the Issuer and the Company, documentary L/C's will be
governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,
International Chamber of Commerce, Publication No. 500, and standby L/C's will
be governed by International Standby Practices ISP98 (adopted by the
International Chamber of Commerce on April 6, 1998) and any respective
subsequent revisions thereof.

         (g)      The obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement with
respect to L/C's are absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable and shall be
performed strictly in accordance with the terms hereof under all circumstances,
whatsoever including, without limitation, the following:

                  (i)   Any lack of validity or enforceability or restriction,
         restraint, or stay in the enforcement of this Agreement, any L/C, or
         any other agreement or instrument relating thereto.

                  (ii)  Such Borrower's consent to any amendment or waiver of,
         or consent to the departure from, any L/C.

                  (iii) The existence of any claim, set-off, defense, or other
         right which such Borrower may have at any time against the beneficiary
         of any L/C.

                  (iv)  Any good faith honoring of a drawing under any L/C,
         which drawing possibly could have been dishonored based upon a strict
         construction of the terms of the L/C.

         2.21. CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES.

         (a)      The Agent may advise the Company that the Agent has made the
good faith determination (which determination shall be final and conclusive) of
any of the following:

                 (i)   Adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
         rate for Eurodollar Loans.

                 (ii)  The continuation of or conversion of any Revolving Credit
         Loan to a Eurodollar Loan has been made impracticable or unlawful by
         the occurrence of a contingency that materially and adversely affects
         the applicable market or the compliance by the Agent or any Revolving
         Credit Lender in good faith with any Applicable Law.
<PAGE>   46
                                      -38-


                 (iii) The indices on which the interest rates for Eurodollar
         Loans are based shall no longer represent the effective cost to the
         Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender for U.S. dollar deposits in the
         interbank market for deposits in which it regularly participates.

         (b)      In the event that the Agent advises the Company of an
occurrence described in Section 2.21(a), then, until the Agent notifies the
Company that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer apply:

                  (i)   The obligation of the Agent or each Revolving Credit
         Lender to make loans of the type affected by such changed circumstances
         or to permit the Borrowers to select the affected interest rate as
         otherwise applicable to any Revolving Credit Loans shall be suspended.

                  (ii)  Any notice which the Borrowers had given the Agent with
         respect to any Eurodollar Loan, the time for action with respect to
         which has not occurred prior to the Agent's having given notice
         pursuant to Section 2.21(a), shall be deemed at the option of the Agent
         to not having been given.

         2.22. LENDERS' COMMITMENTS.

         (a)      Subject to Section 16.1 (which provides for assignments and
assumptions of commitments), each Revolving Credit Lender's "REVOLVING CREDIT
PERCENTAGE COMMITMENT", and "MAXIMUM REVOLVING CREDIT DOLLAR COMMITMENT"
(respectively so referred to herein) is set forth on SCHEDULE 2.22, annexed
hereto.

         (b)      The obligations of each Revolving Credit Lender are several
and not joint. No Revolving Credit Lender shall have any obligation to make any
loan or advance under the Revolving Credit in excess of the lesser of the
following:

                  (i)   That Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit
         Percentage Commitment of the subject loan or advance or of
         Availability.

                  (ii)  that Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Dollar
         Commitment.

         (c)      No Revolving Credit Lender shall have any liability to any
Borrower on account of the failure of any other Revolving Credit Lender to
provide any loan or advance under the Revolving Credit nor any obligation to
make up any shortfall which may be created by such failure.

         (d)      The Revolving Credit Dollar Commitments, Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentages, and identities of the Revolving Credit Lenders may be
changed, from time to time by the reallocation or assignment of Revolving Credit
Dollar Commitments and Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages amongst the
Revolving Credit Lenders or with other Persons who determine to become
"Revolving Credit Lenders", provided, however unless an Event of Default has
occurred (in which event, no consent of any

<PAGE>   47
                                      -39-


Borrower is required) any assignment to a Person not then a Revolving Credit
Lender shall be subject to the prior consent of the Borrowers (not to be
unreasonably withheld), which consent will be deemed given unless the Borrowers
provides the Agent with written objection, not more than ten (10) Business Days
after the Agent shall have given the Borrowers written notice of a proposed
assignment).

         (e)      Upon written notice given the Borrowers from time to time by
the Agent, of any assignment or allocation referenced in Section 2.22(d):

                  (i)   Each Borrower shall execute one or more replacement
         Revolving Credit Notes to reflect such changed Maximum Revolving Credit
         Dollar Commitments, Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages, and
         identities and shall deliver such replacement Revolving Credit Notes to
         the Agent (which promptly thereafter shall deliver to the Borrowers the
         Revolving Credit Notes so replaced) provided however, in the event that
         a Revolving Credit Note is to be exchanged following its acceleration
         or the entry of an order for relief under the Bankruptcy Code with
         respect to any Borrower, the Agent, in lieu of causing each Borrower to
         execute one or more new Revolving Credit Notes, may issue the Agent's
         Certificate confirming the resulting Revolving Credit Dollar
         Commitments and Revolving Credit Percentage Commitments.

                  (ii)  Such change shall be effective from the effective date
         specified in such written notice and any Person added as a Revolving
         Credit Lender shall have all rights and privileges of a Revolving
         Credit Lender hereunder thereafter as if such Person had been a
         signatory to this Agreement and any other Loan Document to which a
         Revolving Credit Lender is a signatory and any Person removed as a
         Revolving Credit Lender shall be relieved of any obligations or
         responsibilities of a Revolving Credit Lender hereunder thereafter.

         (f)      From time to time on not less than three (3) Business Days
notice to the Agent, the Company may elect to increase (but not decrease) the
Revolving Credit Ceiling in $10,000,000 increments up to a maximum amount equal
to the Maximum Revolving Credit Ceiling.

         sale, lease or other disposition, such Real Estate shall no longer
         constitute Eligible Real Estate Assets.

                  (v)     Any sale or discount of Accounts Receivable, in the

                           (B) No agreement is extant which waives or extends
                  any statute of limitations applicable to the right of any

Agreement or of any financing statement or other instrument executed pursuant to

Revolving Credit Lender by each Borrower have been prepared in accordance with

Borrower at the date(s) thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for
the period(s) covered (provided however, that unaudited financial statements are
subject to normal year end adjustments and to the absence of footnotes). There
has been no change in the financial condition, results of operations, or cash

given to the Agent or to any Revolving Credit Lender by or on behalf of any

this Agreement by the Agent and to each Revolving Credit Lender contains or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
There is no fact known to any Borrower which has, or which, in the foreseeable
future is expected to have, a material adverse effect on the financial condition
of any such Borrower or any such guarantor which has not been disclosed in
writing to the Agent.

directly or indirectly become subject to any agreement which prohibits or
restricts, in any manner, such Borrower's:

done any act which, if done directly by such Borrower, would breach any covenant
contained in this Agreement.

         4.28. LEASE SUBORDINATION. The Borrowers covenant and agree that, in
the event that the Indenture of Mortgage, Deed of Trust and Deed to Secure Debt

created and granted herein is in addition to, and supplemental of, any security
interest previously granted by any Borrower to the Agent and shall continue in

interest created herein is specifically terminated in writing by a duly
authorized officer of the Agent.

         8.3. CONCERNING REVISED ARTICLE 9 OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. The
parties acknowledge and agree to the following provisions of this Agreement in
anticipation of the possible application, in one or more jurisdictions to the
transactions contemplated hereby, of UCC9'99.

         (a) Attachment. In applying the law of any jurisdiction in which
UCC9'99 is in effect, the Collateral is all assets covered by the description of
Collateral, whether or not within the scope of UCC9'99. The Collateral shall
include, without limitation, the following categories of assets as defined in
UCC9'99: inventory, instruments (including promissory notes), documents,
accounts (including health-care-insurance receivables), chattel paper (whether
tangible or electronic), deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights (whether or
not the letter of credit is evidenced by a writing), commercial tort claims,
securities and all other investment property, general intangibles (including
payment intangibles and software), supporting obligations and any and all
proceeds of any thereof, wherever located, whether now owned and hereafter
acquired. If any Borrower shall at any time, whether or not UCC9'99 is in effect
in any particular jurisdiction, acquire a commercial tort claim, as defined in
UCC9'99, such Borrower shall immediately notify the Agent in a writing signed by
such Borrower of the brief details thereof and grant to the Agent in such
writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the
terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Agent.

         (b) Perfection by Filing. The Agent may at any time and from time to
time, pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.24(c), file financing statements,
continuation statements and amendments thereto that describe the Collateral as
set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.3(a) and which contain any other
information required by Part 5 of UCC9'99 for the sufficiency or filing office
acceptance of any financing statement, continuation statement or amendment,
including whether such Borrower is an organization, the type of organization and
any organization identification number issued to such Borrower. Each Borrower
agrees to furnish any such information to the Agent promptly upon request. Any
such financing statements, continuation statements or amendments may be signed
by the Agent on behalf of such Borrower, as provided in Section 4.24(d), and may
be filed at any time in any jurisdiction whether or not UCC9'99 is then in
effect in that jurisdiction.

<PAGE>   77

                                      -69-

         (c) Other Perfection, etc. Each Borrower shall at any time and from
time to time, whether or not UCC9'99 is in effect in any particular
jurisdiction, take such steps as the Agent may reasonably request for the Agent
(a) to obtain an acknowledgement, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Agent, of any bailee having possession of any of the Collateral that the bailee
holds such Collateral for the Agent, (b) to obtain "control" of any investment
property, deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights or electronic chattel paper
(as such terms are defined in UCC9'99 with corresponding provisions in UCC
ss.ss. 9-104, 9-105, 9-106 and 9-107 relating to what constitutes "control" for
such items of Collateral), with any agreements establishing control to be in
form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, and (c) otherwise to insure the
continued perfection and priority of the Agent's security interest in any of the
Collateral and of the preservation of its rights therein, whether in
anticipation and following the effectiveness of UCC9'99 in any jurisdiction

         (d) Savings Clause. Nothing contained in this Section 8.3 shall be
construed to narrow the scope of the Agent's security interest in any of the
Collateral or the perfection or priority thereof or to impair or otherwise limit
any of the rights, powers, privileges or remedies of the Agent or any Revolving
Credit Lender hereunder except (and then only to the extent) mandated by UCC9'99
to the extent then applicable.

         8.4. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. (a) Joint and Several Liability. Each
of the Borrowers is and shall be jointly and severally liable for each and every
Liability or any of the other instruments at any time evidencing any Liability.
Each Borrower agrees that it shall be jointly and severally liable for all fees,
as well as each of the other Liabilities of any of the Borrowers arising or
incurred under or in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents. The joint and several liability of the Borrowers hereunder shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger,
amalgamation or other change whatsoever in the name, membership, constitution or
place or formation of the Borrowers.

         (b) Consideration. Each of the Borrowers is accepting joint and several
liability hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodations to be
provided by the Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders under this Agreement, for
the mutual benefit, directly or indirectly, of each of the Borrowers and in
consideration of the undertakings of each of the Borrowers to accept joint and
several liability for the obligations of each of the Borrowers.

         (c) Payment. If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make
any payment with respect to any of the Liabilities hereunder as and when due or
to perform any of such Liabilities in accordance with the terms hereof, then in
each such event, any other Borrower will make such payment with respect to, or
perform, such Liabilities.

         (d) Recourse. The obligations of each of the Borrowers under the
provisions of this Section 8.4 constitute full recourse obligations of such
Person, enforceable against it to the full extent of its properties and assets,
irrespective of the validity,

<PAGE>   78

                                      -70-


regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
against any Borrower or any other circumstances whatsoever.

         (e) Contribution. To the extent any Borrower makes a payment hereunder
in excess of the aggregate amount of the benefit received by such Person in
respect of the extensions of credit under the Agreement (the "Benefit Amount"),
then such Person, after the payment in full in cash of all of the Liabilities,
shall be entitled to recover from each other Person such excess payment, pro
rata in accordance with the ratio of the Benefit Amount received by all such
other Persons to the total Benefit Amounts received by such Person, and the
right to such recovery shall be deemed to be an asset and property of such
Person so funding; provided that all such rights to recovery shall be
subordinate and junior in right of payment to the final and indefeasible
repayment in full in cash of all of the Liabilities.

and all checks, drafts, notes, acceptances, or other items or instruments; sign
and endorse the name of such Borrower on, and receive as secured party, any of

exercise of power, and shall not be responsible to any Borrower for any act or
omission to act except for any act or omission to act as to which there is a

and discretions of the Agent hereunder (herein, the "AGENT'S RIGHTS AND

Commitment of the subject Revolving Credit Loan to the Agent.

         12.2. SWINGLINE LOANS.

         (a)      In the event that, when a Revolving Credit Loan is requested,
the aggregate unpaid balance of the SwingLine Loan is less than the SwingLine
Loan Ceiling, then the SwingLine Lender may advise the Agent that the SwingLine
Lender has determined to include up to the amount of the requested Revolving
Credit Loan as part of the SwingLine Loan. In such event, the SwingLine Lender
shall Transfer the amount of the requested Revolving Credit Loan to the Agent.

         (b)      The SwingLine Loan shall be converted to a Revolving Credit
Loan in which all Revolving Credit Lenders participate as follows:

                  (i)  At any time and from time to time, the SwingLine Lender
         may advise the Agent that all, or any part of the SwingLine Loan is to
         be converted to a Revolving Credit Loan in which all Revolving Credit
         Lenders participate.

                  (ii) At the initiation of a Liquidation, the then entire
         unpaid principal balance of the SwingLine Loan shall be converted to a
         Revolving Credit Loan in which all Revolving Credit Lenders
         participate.

In either such event, the Agent shall advise each Revolving Credit Lender of
such conversion as if, and with the same effect as if such conversion were the
making of a Revolving Credit Loan as provided in Section 2.1.

         (c)      The SwingLine Lender, in separate capacities, may also be the
Agent and a Revolving Credit Lender.

         (d)      The SwingLine Lender, in its capacity as SwingLine Lender, is
not a "Revolving Credit Lender" for any of the following purposes:

                  (i)   Except as otherwise specifically provided in the
         relevant Section, any distribution pursuant to Section 13.6.

                  (ii)  Determination of whether the requisite Loan Commitments

Agent, as provided herein, that Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit
Percentage Commitment of the following:

                  (i)   Each Revolving Credit Loan, up to the maximum amount
         of that Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Dollar Commitment of
         the Revolving Credit Loans.

                  (ii)  Up to the maximum amount of that Revolving Credit
         Lender's Revolving Credit Dollar Commitment of each L/C Drawing (to the
         extent that such L/C Drawing is not "covered" by a Revolving Credit
         Loan as provided herein).

         (b)      In all circumstances, the Agent may:

                  (i)   Assume that each Revolving Credit Lender, subject to
         Section 12.3(a), timely shall make available to the Agent that
         Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage Commitment of
         each Revolving Credit Loan, notice of which is provided pursuant to
         Section 12.1 and shall make available, to the extent not "covered" by a
         Revolving Credit Loan, that Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit
         Percentage Commitment of any honoring of an L/C.

                  (ii)  In reliance upon such assumption, make available the
         corresponding amount to the Borrowers.

                  (iii) Assume that each Revolving Credit Lender timely shall
         pay, and shall make available, to the Agent all other amounts which
         that Revolving Credit Lender is obligated to so pay and/or make
         available hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents.

         (c)      In the event that, in reliance upon any of such assumptions,
the Agent makes available, a Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit
Percentage Commitment of one or more Revolving Credit Loans, or any other amount
to be made available hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents, which amount
a Revolving Credit

                                      -79-

Lender (a "DELINQUENT REVOLVING CREDIT LENDER") fails to provide to the
Agent within One (1) Business Day of written notice of such failure, then:

                  (i)   The amount which had been made available by the Agent is
         an "AGENT'S COVER" (and is so referred to herein).

                  (ii)  All interest paid by the Borrowers on account of the
         Revolving Credit Loan or coverage of the subject L/C Drawing which
         consist of the Agent's Cover shall be retained by the Agent until the
         Agent's Cover, with interest, has been paid.

                  (iii) The Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the
         Agent, on demand, interest at a rate equal to the prevailing federal
         funds rate on any Agent's Cover in respect of that Delinquent Revolving
         Credit Lender

                  (iv)  The Agent shall have succeeded to all rights to payment
         to which the Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender otherwise would have
         been entitled hereunder in respect of those amounts paid by or in
         respect of the Borrowers on account of the Agent's Cover together with
         interest until it is repaid. Such payments shall be deemed made first
         towards the amounts in respect of which the Agent's Cover was provided
         and only then towards amounts in which the Delinquent Revolving Credit
         Lender is then participating. For purposes of distributions to be made
         pursuant to Section 12.4(a) (which relates to ordinary course
         distributions) or Section 13.6 (which relates to distributions of
         proceeds of a Liquidation) below, amounts shall be deemed distributable
         to a Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender (and consequently, to the Agent
         to the extent to which the Agent is then entitled) at the highest level
         of distribution (if applicable) at which the Delinquent Revolving
         Credit Lender would otherwise have been entitled to a distribution.

                  (v)   Subject to Subsection 12.3(c)(iv), the Delinquent
         Revolving Credit Lender shall be entitled to receive any payments from
         the Borrowers to which the Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender is then
         entitled, provided however there shall be deducted from such amount and
         retained by the Agent any interest to which the Agent is then entitled
         on account of Section 12.3(c)(ii), above.

                  (vi)  A Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender shall not be
         relieved of any obligation of such Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender
         hereunder (all and each of which shall constitute continuing
         obligations on the part of any Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender).

         (d)      A Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender may cure its status as a
Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender by paying the Agent the aggregate of the
following:

                  (i)   The Agent's Cover (to the extent not previously repaid
         by the Borrowers and retained by the Agent in accordance with
         Subsection 12.3(c)(iv), above) with respect to that Delinquent
         Revolving Credit Lender.

                  (ii)  The aggregate of the amount payable under Subsection
         12.3(c)(iii), above (which relates to interest to be paid by that
         Delinquent Revolving Credit Lender).

                  Plus

                  (iii) All such costs and expenses as may be incurred by the
         Agent in the enforcement of the Agent's rights against such Delinquent
         Revolving Credit Lender.

the provisions of Section 13.6 (which relates to distributions in the event of a
Liquidation) becomes operative.

Agent (or more frequently at the Agent's option) the Agent and each Revolving
Credit Lender shall settle up on amounts advanced under the Revolving Credit and
collected funds received in the Concentration Account.

         (b)      The Agent shall distribute to the SwingLine Lender and to each
Revolving Credit Lender, such Person's respective pro-rata share of interest
payments on the Revolving Credit Loans when applied by the Agent as provided in
Section 7.5(a). For purposes of calculating interest due to a Revolving Credit
Lender, that Revolving Credit Lender shall be entitled to receive interest on
the actual amount contributed by that Revolving Credit Lender towards the
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding during the
applicable period covered by the interest payment made by the Borrowers. Any net
principal reductions to the Revolving Credit Loans received by the Agent in
accordance with the Loan Documents during such period shall not reduce such
actual amount so contributed, for purposes of calculation of interest due to
that Revolving Credit Lender, until the Agent has distributed to that Revolving
Credit Lender its pro-rata share thereof.

         (c)      The Agent shall distribute fees paid on account of the
Revolving Credit as determined by the Agent:

         (d)      No Revolving Credit Lender shall have any interest in, or

Agent pursuant to this Agreement.

         (e)      Any amount received by the Agent as reimbursement for any cost
or expense (including without limitation, attorneys' reasonable fees) shall be
distributed by the Agent to that Person which is entitled to such reimbursement
as provided in this Agreement (and if such Person(s) is (are) the Revolving
Credit Lenders, pro-rata based upon their respective Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentages at the date on which the expense, in respect of which such
reimbursement is being made, was incurred).

any fiduciary relationship with, any Revolving Credit Lender except for those

responsible to any Revolving Credit Lender for any of the following:

                  (i)   Any recitals, statements, representations or warranties
         made by any Borrower or any other Person.

                  (ii)  Any appraisals or other assessments of the assets of any
         Borrower or of any other Person responsible for or on account of the
         Liabilities.

                  (iii) The value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
         enforceability, or sufficiency of the Loan Agreement, the Loan
         Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein.

                  (iv)  Any failure by any Borrower or any other Person (other
         than the Agent) to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents.

         (c)      The Agent may employ attorneys, accountants, and other
professionals and agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for
the negligence or misconduct of any such attorneys, accountants, and other
professionals or agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by the Agent with
reasonable care. No such attorney, accountant, other professional, agent, or
attorney-in-fact shall be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any other such Person.

         (d)      Neither the Agent, nor any of its directors, officers, or
employees shall be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken or
omitted to be taken by any other of them in connection herewith in reliance upon

omitted to be taken as to which a final judicial determination has been or is

that such Person had acted in a grossly negligent manner, in actual bad faith,
or in willful misconduct.

         (e)      The Agent shall not have any responsibility in any event for
more funds than the Agent actually receives and collects.

         (f)      The Agent, in its separate capacity as a Lender, shall have
the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender.

         14.3. CONCERNING DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE AGENT.

         (a)      The Agent in the Agent's reasonable discretion based upon the
Agent's determination of the likelihood that additional payments will be
received, expenses


<PAGE>   93

                                      -85-


incurred, and/or claims made by third parties to all or a portion of such
proceeds, may delay the distribution of any payment received on account of the
Liabilities.

         (b) The Agent may disburse funds prior to determining that the sums
which the Agent expects to receive have been finally and unconditionally paid to
the Agent. If and to the extent that the Agent does disburse funds and it later
becomes apparent that the Agent did not then receive a payment in an amount
equal to the sum paid out, then any Revolving Credit Lender to whom the Agent
made the funds available, on demand from the Agent, shall refund to the Agent
the sum paid to that person.

         (c) If, in the opinion of the Agent, the distribution of any amount
received by the Agent might involve the Agent in liability, or might be
prohibited hereby, or might be questioned by any Person, then the Agent may
refrain from making distribution until the Agent's right to make distribution
has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction.

         (d) The proceeds of any Revolving Credit Lender's exercise of any right
of, or in the nature of, set-off shall be deemed, First, to the extent that a
Revolving Credit Lender is entitled to any distribution hereunder, to constitute
such distribution and Second, shall be shared with the other Revolving Credit
Lenders as if distributed pursuant to (and shall be deemed as distributions
under) Section 13.7.

         (e) Each Revolving Credit Lender recognizes that the crediting of the
Borrowers with the "proceeds" of any transaction in which a Post Foreclosure
Asset is acquired is a non-cash transaction and that, in consequence, no
distribution of such "proceeds" will be made by the Agent to any Lender.

         (f) In the event that (x) a court of competent jurisdiction shall
adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the Agent is to be repaid or
disgorged or (y) the SuperMajority Lenders determine to effect such repayment or
disgorgement, then each Revolving Credit Lender to which any such distribution
shall have been made shall repay, to the Agent which had made such distribution,
that Revolving Credit Lender's pro-rata share of the amount so adjudged or
determined to be repaid or disgorged.

         14.4. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Any dispute among the Revolving Credit
Lenders and/or the Agent concerning the interpretation, administration, or
enforcement of the financing arrangements contemplated by this or any other Loan
Document or the interpretation or administration of this or any other Loan
Document which cannot be resolved amicably shall be resolved in the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, sitting in Boston or in
the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, to the jurisdiction of
which courts each Revolving Credit Lender hereto hereby submits.

         14.5. DISTRIBUTIONS OF NOTICES AND OF DOCUMENTS. The Agent will forward

copy of each notice or other document furnished to the Agent pursuant to this

to be furnished to the Revolving Credit Lenders by any Borrower.

         (d)      Any notice or document of which the Agent has knowledge that
such notice or document had been forwarded to the Revolving Credit Lenders other
than by the Agent.

         14.6.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         (a)      Each Revolving Credit Lender will maintain, as confidential,
all of the following:

                  (i)   Proprietary approaches, techniques, and methods of

such information as may be required to be provided by judicial process or which
may be required or requested by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over
any party to this Agreement.

         14.7. RELIANCE BY AGENT. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
certificate, notice or other document (including any cable, telegram, telex, or
facsimile) reasonably believed by the Agent to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper person or persons, and
upon advice and statements of attorneys, accountants and other experts selected
by the Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for in this Agreement,
any Loan Document, or in any other document referred to therein, the Agent shall
in all events be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, in

given with the requisite consent shall be binding on all Revolving Credit
Lenders.

Credit Lenders and to the Agent that such Revolving Credit Lender:

                  (i)   Independently and without reliance on any representation
         or act by Agent or by any other Revolving Credit Lender, and based on
         such documents and information as that Revolving Credit Lender has
         deemed appropriate, has made such Revolving Credit Lender's own
         appraisal of the financial condition and affairs of any Borrower and
         decision to enter into this Agreement.

                  (ii)   Has relied upon that Revolving Credit Lender's review
         of the Loan Documents by that Revolving Credit Lender and by counsel to
         that Revolving Credit Lender as that Revolving Credit Lender deemed
         appropriate under the circumstances.

         (b)      Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees that such Revolving Credit
Lender, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Revolving
Credit Lender, and based upon such documents and information as such Revolving
Credit Lender shall deem appropriate at the time, will continue to make such
Revolving Credit Lender's own appraisals of the financial condition and affairs
of each Borrower when determining whether to take or not to take any
discretionary action under this Agreement.

         (c)      The Agent, in the discharge of that Agent's duties hereunder,
shall not be required to make inquiry of, or to inspect the properties or books
of, any Person.

         (d)      Except for notices, reports, and other documents and
information expressly required to be furnished to the Revolving Credit Lenders
by the Agent hereunder (as to which, see Section 14.5), the Agent shall not have
any affirmative duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning any Person, which information may come into the
possession of Agent or any Affiliate of the Agent.

         (e)      Each Revolving Credit Lender, at such Revolving Credit
Lender's request, shall have reasonable access to all nonprivileged documents in
the possession of the Agent, which documents relate to the Agent's performance
of its duties hereunder.

         14.9. INDEMNIFICATION. Without limiting the liabilities of each
Borrower under this or any of the other Loan Documents, each Revolving Credit
Lender shall indemnify the Agent, pro-rata, for any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including attorneys'
reasonable fees and expenses and other out-of-pocket expenditures) which may at
any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent and in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
any documents contemplated by or referred to therein or the transactions
contemplated thereby or the enforcement of any of terms hereof or thereof or of
any such other documents, provided, however, no Revolving Credit Lender shall be
liable

                                      -88-


for any of the foregoing to the extent that any of the foregoing arises
from any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent as to which a final
judicial determination has been or is made (in a proceeding in which the Agent
has had an opportunity to be heard) that the Agent had acted in a grossly
negligent manner, in actual bad faith, or in willful misconduct.

         14.10.  RESIGNATION OF AGENT.

         (a) The Agent may resign at any time by giving 60 days prior written
notice thereof to the Revolving Credit Lenders. Upon receipt of any such notice
of resignation, the SuperMajority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor to such Agent (and if no Event of Default has occurred, with the
consent of the Borrowers, not to be unreasonably withheld and, in any event,
deemed given by the Borrowers if no written objection is provided by the
Borrowers to the (resigning) Agent within seven (7) Business Days after
receiving notice of such proposed appointment). If a successor Agent shall not
have been so appointed and accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
giving of notice by the resigning Agent, then the resigning Agent may appoint a
successor Agent, which shall be a financial institution having a rating of not
less than "A" or its equivalent if rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group (and
if no Event of Default has occurred, with the consent of the Borrowers, not to
be unreasonably withheld and, in any event, deemed given by the Borrowers if no
written objection is provided by the Borrowers to the (resigning) Agent within
seven (7) Business Days after receiving notice of such proposed appointment).
The consent of the Borrowers otherwise required by this Section 14.10(a) shall
not be required if an Event of Default has occurred.

         (b) Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent, such successor shall thereupon succeed to, and become vested
with, all the rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the (resigning) Agent so
replaced, and the (resigning) Agent shall be discharged from the (resigning)
Agent's duties and obligations hereunder, other than on account of any
responsibility for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the (resigning)
Agent as to which a final judicial determination has been or is made (in a
proceeding in which the (resigning) Person has had an opportunity to be heard)
that such Person had acted in a grossly negligent manner or in bad faith.

         (c) After any retiring Agent's resignation, the provisions of this
Agreement and of all other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for the
retiring Person's benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was acting as Agent.

under the Revolving Credit which results in a Protective OverAdvance may be made
by the Agent in its discretion without the Consent of the Revolving Credit
Lenders and that each Revolving Credit Lender shall be bound thereby, provided,
however, the Consent or direction of the SuperMajority Lenders is required to
permit a Protective OverAdvance to be outstanding for more than 45 consecutive
Business Days or more than twice in any twelve month period.

         (b)      If any Borrower is then InDefault, the SuperMajority Lenders
may direct the Agent to suspend the Revolving Credit, whereupon, as long as any

         15.5. ACTIONS REQUIRING OR DIRECTED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT. None of the

otherwise required or provided for in the Loan Documents or to facilitate a
Liquidation.

         (g)      Any amendment of the definition of the terms "Borrowing Base"
or "Availability" or of any Definition of any component thereof, such that more
credit would be available to the Borrowers, based on the same assets, as would

<PAGE>   99

                                      -91-

                  (i)   The foregoing shall not limit the adjustment by the

         making of any Revolving Credit Loan to "cover" any honoring of a
         drawing under any L/C; and

                  (ii)  each Lender recognizes that subsequent to the making
         of a Revolving Credit Loan which does not constitute a Protective
         OverAdvance, the unpaid principal balance of the Loan Account may
         exceed Borrowing Base on account of changed circumstances beyond the
         control of the Agent (such as a drop in collateral value).

         (j)      The waiver of the obligation of the Borrowers to reduce the
unpaid principal balance of loans under the Revolving Credit to an amount so
that no OverLoan (other than a Protective OverAdvance) is outstanding or,
subject to the time limits included in Section 15.3(a) (which places time and
frequency limits on Protective OverAdvance), to eliminate a Protective
OverAdvance.

         (k)      Any amendment of this Article 15.

                  "Appraised Inventory Liquidation Value"
                  "Appraised Inventory Percentage"
                  "Majority Lender"

provision of the Loan Documents or of this Agreement which affects the Agent in
its capacity as Agent may be undertaken without the written consent of the
Agent.

obligations, or liabilities of the Agent shall be effective without the written
consent of the Agent.

         15.8. MISCELLANEOUS ACTIONS.

single Revolving Credit Lender independently may exercise any right of action or
enforcement against or with respect to the Borrowers.

         (b)      The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to

                  (ii)  be indemnified to the Agent's satisfaction by the
         Revolving Credit Lenders against any and all liability and expense
         which may be incurred by the Agent by reason of taking or continuing to
         take any such action, unless such action had been grossly negligent, in
         willful misconduct, or in bad faith.

         (c)      The Agent may establish reasonable procedures for the
providing of direction and instructions from the Revolving Credit Lenders to the
Agent, including its reliance on multiple counterparts, facsimile transmissions,
and time limits within which such direction and instructions must be received in

15.10, a "NONCONSENTING REVOLVING CREDIT LENDER") does not provide its consent

                  (i)   The amount otherwise to be Transferred to the
         NonConsenting Revolving Credit Lender shall be Transferred to the Agent
         and held by the Agent, without interest, to be turned over to the

         (c)      Until such payment (Section 18.2(a)) and arrangements
concerning L/C's (Section 18.2(b)), all provisions of this Agreement, other than
those included in Article 2: which place any obligation on the Agent or any
Revolving Credit Lender to make any loans or advances or to provide any
financial accommodations to the Borrowers shall remain in full force and effect
until all Liabilities shall have been paid in full.

         (d)      The release by the Agent of the Collateral Interests granted
the Agent by the Borrowers hereunder may be upon such conditions and
indemnifications as the Agent may require.

ARTICLE XIX. GENERAL

         19.1. PROTECTION OF COLLATERAL. The Agent's sole duty with respect to
the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its
possession, under ss.9-207 of the UCC (or UCC9'99 as applicable) or otherwise,
shall be to deal with such Collateral in the same manner as the Agent deals with
similar property for its own account.

         19.2. PUBLICITY. The Agent may issue a "tombstone" notice of the
establishment of the credit facility contemplated by this Agreement and may make
reference to the Borrowers (and may utilize any logo or other distinctive symbol
associated with the Borrowers) in connection with any advertising, promotion, or
marketing undertaken by the Agent.

         19.3. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of each Borrower and each Borrower's successors, and
assigns and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Agent and each
Revolving Credit Lender and their respective successors and assigns, provided,
however, no trustee or other fiduciary appointed with respect to any Borrower
shall have any rights hereunder. In the event that the Agent or any Revolving
Credit Lender assigns or transfers its rights under this Agreement, the assignee
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested

<PAGE>   107

                                      -99-


with all rights, powers, privileges, and duties of such assignor hereunder and
such assignor shall thereupon be discharged and relieved from its duties and
obligations hereunder.

         19.4. SEVERABILITY. Any determination that any provision of this
Agreement or any application thereof is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in
any respect in any instance shall not affect the validity, legality, or
enforceability of such provision in any other instance, or the validity,
legality, or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

         19.5. AMENDMENTS. COURSE OF DEALING.

         (a)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents incorporate all
discussions and negotiations between the Borrowers and the Agent and each
Revolving Credit Lender, either express or implied, concerning the matters
included herein and in such other instruments, any custom, usage, or course of
dealings to the contrary notwithstanding. No such discussions, negotiations,
custom, usage, or course of dealings shall limit, modify, or otherwise affect
the provisions thereof. No failure by the Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender
to give notice to the Borrowers of any Borrower having failed to observe and
comply with any warranty or covenant included in any Loan Document shall
constitute a waiver of such warranty or covenant or the amendment of the subject
Loan Document. No change made by the Agent to the manner by which Borrowing Base
is determined shall obligate the Agent to continue to determine Borrowing Base
in that manner.

         (b)      The Borrowers may undertake any action otherwise prohibited
hereby, and may omit to take any action otherwise required hereby, upon and with
the express prior written consent of the Agent given in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Subject to Article 15:, no consent, modification,
amendment, or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document shall be effective
unless executed in writing by or on behalf of the party to be charged with such
modification, amendment, or waiver (and if such party is the Agent then by a
duly authorized officer thereof). Any modification, amendment, or waiver
provided by the Agent shall be in reliance upon all representations and
warranties theretofore made to the Agent by or on behalf of the Borrowers (and
any guarantor, endorser, or surety of the Liabilities) and consequently may be
rescinded in the event that any of such representations or warranties was not
true and complete in all material respects when given.

         19.6. POWER OF ATTORNEY. In connection with all powers of attorney
included in this Agreement, each Borrower hereby grants unto the Agent (acting
through any of its officers) full power to do any and all things necessary or
appropriate in connection with the exercise of such powers as fully and
effectually as each Borrower might or could do, hereby ratifying all that said
attorney shall do or cause to be done by virtue of this Agreement. No power of
attorney set forth in this Agreement shall be affected by any disability or
incapacity suffered by any Borrower and each shall survive the same. All powers
conferred upon the Agent by this Agreement, being coupled with an interest,

<PAGE>   108

                                     -100-


shall be irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated by a written instrument
executed by a duly authorized officer of the Agent.

         19.7. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of any collection, sale, or
disposition of the Collateral, or of any other payments received hereunder,
shall be applied towards the Liabilities in such order and manner as the Agent
determines in its sole discretion, consistent, however, with Sections 13.6 and
13.7 and any other applicable provisions of this Agreement. Each Borrower shall
remain liable for any deficiency remaining following such application.

         19.8. INCREASED COSTS. If, as a result of any Requirement of Law, or of
the interpretation or application thereof by any court or by any governmental or
other authority or entity charged with the administration thereof, whether or
not having the force of law, which:

         (a)      ubjects any Revolving Credit Lender to any taxes or changes
the basis of taxation, or increases any existing taxes, on payments of
principal, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Agent or
any Revolving Credit Lender under this Agreement (except for taxes on the Agent
or any Revolving Credit Lender based on net income or capital imposed by the
jurisdiction in which the principal or lending offices of the Agent or that
Revolving Credit Lender are located);

         (b)      imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, cash
margin, special deposit or similar requirements against assets held by, or
deposits in or for the account of or loans by or any other acquisition of funds
by the relevant funding office of any Revolving Credit Lender;

         (c)      imposes on any Revolving Credit Lender any other condition
with respect to any Loan Document; or

         (d)      imposes on any Revolving Credit Lender a requirement to
maintain or allocate capital in relation to the Liabilities;

and the result of any of the foregoing, in such Revolving Credit Lender's
reasonable opinion, is to increase the cost to that Revolving Credit Lender of
making or maintaining any loan, advance or financial accommodation or to reduce
the income receivable by that Revolving Credit Lender in respect of any loan,
advance or financial accommodation by an amount which that Revolving Credit
Lender deems to be material, then upon written notice from the Agent, from time
to time, to the Company (such notice to set out in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to and a summary calculation of such increased cost or reduced
income), the Borrowers shall forthwith pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the
subject Revolving Credit Lender, upon receipt of such notice, that amount which
shall compensate the subject Revolving Credit Lender for such additional cost or
reduction in income.

         19.9. COSTS AND EXPENSES OF THE AGENT.

         (a)      The Borrowers shall pay from time to time on demand all Costs
of Collection and all reasonable costs, expenses, and disbursements (including
attorneys' reasonable fees and expenses) which are incurred by the Agent and the
Syndication Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
and delivery of this Agreement and of any other Loan Documents, and all other
reasonable costs, expenses, and disbursements which may be incurred in
connection with or in respect to the credit facility contemplated hereby or
which otherwise are incurred with respect to the Liabilities.

         (b)      The Borrowers shall pay from time to time on demand all
reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' reasonable fees and
expenses) incurred, following the occurrence of any Event of Default, by the
Revolving Credit Lenders to Lenders' Special Counsel.

         (c)      Each Borrower authorizes the Agent to pay all such fees and
expenses and in the Agent's discretion, to add such fees and expenses to the
Loan Account.

         (d)      The undertaking on the part of each Borrower in this Section
19.9 shall survive payment of the Liabilities and/or any termination, release,
or discharge executed by the Agent in favor of any Borrower, other than a
termination, release, or discharge which makes specific reference to this
Section 19.9.

         19.10. COPIES AND FACSIMILES. Each Loan Document and all documents and
papers which relate thereto which have been or may be hereinafter furnished the
Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender may be reproduced by that Revolving Credit
Lender or by the Agent by any photographic, microfilm, xerographic, digital
imaging, or other process, and such Person making such reproduction may destroy
any document so reproduced. Any such reproduction shall be admissible in
evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding
(whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such
reproduction was made in the regular course of business). Any facsimile which
bears proof of transmission shall be binding on the party which or on whose
behalf such transmission was initiated and likewise shall be so admissible in
evidence as if the original of such facsimile had been delivered to the party
which or on whose behalf such transmission was received.

         19.11. MASSACHUSETTS LAW. This Agreement and all rights and obligations
hereunder, including matters of construction, validity, and performance, shall
be governed by the law of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

         19.12. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.

         (a)      Each Borrower agrees that any legal action, proceeding, case,
or controversy against such Borrower with respect to any Loan Document may be

States District Court, District of Massachusetts, sitting in Boston,
Massachusetts, as the Agent may

<PAGE>   110

                                     -102-


elect in the Agent's sole discretion. By execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each Borrower, for itself and in respect of its property, accepts,
submits, and consents generally and unconditionally, to the jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts.

         (b)      Each Borrower WAIVES personal service of any and all process
upon it, and irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Borrower at such Borrower's
address for notices as specified herein, such service to become effective five
(5) Business Days after such mailing.

         (c)       Each Borrower WAIVES any objection based on forum non
conveniens and any objection to venue of any action or proceeding instituted
under any of the Loan Documents and consents to the granting of such legal or
equitable remedy as is deemed appropriate by the Court.

         (d)      Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Agent to bring
legal actions or proceedings in any other competent jurisdiction.

         (e)      Each Borrower agrees that any action commenced by such
Borrower
asserting any claim arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall be brought solely in the Superior Court of Suffolk
County Massachusetts or in the United States District Court, District of
Massachusetts, sitting in Boston, Massachusetts, and that such Courts shall have
exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any such action.

         19.13. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold
the Agent, the Syndication Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender and any
Participant and any of their respective employees, officers, or agents (each, an
"INDEMNIFIED PERSON") harmless of and from any claim brought or threatened
against any Indemnified Person by such Borrower, any guarantor or endorser of
the Liabilities, or any other Person (as well as from attorneys' reasonable
fees, expenses, and disbursements in connection therewith) on account of the
relationship of such Borrower or of any guarantor or endorser of the Liabilities
with such Indemnified Person with respect to any of the Loan Documents or the
transactions described in the Loan Documents, including all costs, expenses,
liabilities, and damages as may be suffered by any Indemnified Person in
connection with (x) the Collateral; (y) the occurrence of any Event of Default;
or (z) the exercise of any rights or remedies under any of the Loan Documents
(each of which claims may be defended, compromised, settled, or pursued by the
Indemnified Person with counsel of the Indemnified Person's selection, but one
of which shall be at the expense of such Borrower) other than any claim as to
which a final determination is made in a judicial proceeding (in which the Agent
and any other Indemnified Person has had an opportunity to be heard), which
determination includes a specific finding that the Indemnified Person seeking
indemnification had acted in a grossly negligent manner or in actual bad faith.
This indemnification shall survive payment of the Liabilities and/or any
termination, release, or discharge executed by the Agent in favor of any
Borrower,

<PAGE>   111

                                     -103-

be applied in the interpretation, construction, and enforcement of this
Agreement and of the other Loan Documents:

Agreement shall govern and control.

         (r)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are the result of
negotiation among, and have been reviewed by counsel to, among others, the Agent
and the Borrowers and are the product of discussions and negotiations among all
parties. Accordingly, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are not
intended to be construed against the Agent or any of the Revolving Credit
Lenders merely on account of the Agent's or any Revolving Credit Lender's
involvement in the preparation of such documents

         19.15. INTENT. It is intended that:

         (a)      This Agreement take effect as a sealed instrument.

<PAGE>   113

                                     -105-


         (b)      The scope of all Collateral Interests created by each Borrower
to secure the Liabilities be broadly construed in favor of the Agent.

         (c)      All Collateral Interests created in favor of the Agent at any
time and from time to time secure all Liabilities, whether now existing or
contemplated or hereafter arising.

         (d)      All reasonable costs, expenses, and disbursements incurred by
the Agent, the Syndication Agent and, to the extent provide in Section 19.9 each
Revolving Credit Lender, in connection with such Person's relationship(s) with
the Borrowers shall be borne by the Borrowers.

         (e)      Unless otherwise explicitly provided herein, the Agent's
consent to any action of any Borrower which is prohibited unless such consent is
given may be given or refused by the Agent in its sole discretion and without
reference to Section 2.17 hereof.

         19.16. PARTICIPATIONS. Each Revolving Credit Lender may sell
participations to one or more financial institutions (each, a "PARTICIPANT") in
that Revolving Credit Lender's interests herein provided that no such
participation shall include any provision which accords that Participant with
any rights, vis-a-vis the Agent, with respect to any requirement herein for
approval by a requisite number or proportion of the Revolving Credit Lenders. No
such sale of a participation shall relieve a Revolving Credit Lender from that
Revolving Credit Lender's obligations hereunder nor obligate the Agent to any
Person other than a Revolving Credit Lender.

         19.17. RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Any and all deposits or other sums at any time
credited by or due to any Borrower from the Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender
or any Participant or from any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, and any cash,
securities, instruments or other property of such Borrower in the possession of
any of the foregoing, whether for safekeeping or otherwise (regardless of the
reason such Person had received the same) shall at all times constitute security
for all Liabilities and for any and all obligations of such Borrower to the
Agent and such Revolving Credit Lender or any Participant or such Affiliate and
may be applied or set off against the Liabilities and against such obligations
at any time that the Borrowers are InDefault, whether or not such are then due
and whether or not other collateral is then available to the Agent or that
Revolving Credit Lender.

         19.18. PLEDGES TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. Nothing included in this
Agreement shall prevent or limit any Revolving Credit Lender, to the extent that
such Revolving Credit Lender is subject to any of the twelve Federal Reserve
Banks organized under ss.4 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. ss.341) from

Document, neither the Agent nor any Revolving Credit Lender shall be entitled to
contract for, charge, receive, collect, or apply as interest on any Liability,
any amount in excess of the maximum rate imposed by Applicable Law. Any payment
which is made which, if treated as interest on a Liability, would result in such

"Collateral."

         and notice, both with respect to the Liabilities and the Collateral.

                  (ii)  Except as otherwise specifically required hereby, the
         right to notice and/or hearing prior to the Agent's exercising of the
         Agent's rights upon default.

                  (iii) THE RIGHT TO A JURY IN ANY TRIAL OF ANY CASE OR
         CONTROVERSY IN WHICH THE AGENT OR ANY REVOLVING CREDIT LENDER IS OR

         AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY REVOLVING CREDIT LENDER OR IN WHICH THE AGENT
         OR ANY REVOLVING CREDIT LENDER IS JOINED AS A PARTY LITIGANT), WHICH
         CASE OR CONTROVERSY ARISES OUT OF OR IS IN RESPECT OF, ANY RELATIONSHIP
         AMONGST OR BETWEEN THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PERSON AND THE AGENT AND
         EACH REVOLVING CREDIT LENDER LIKEWISE WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY IN ANY
         TRIAL OF ANY SUCH CASE OR CONTROVERSY).

         hindrance, delay, or restriction (including, without limitation, any
         automatic stay which otherwise might be imposed pursuant to Section 362
         of the Bankruptcy Code) with respect to any action which the Agent may
         or may become entitled to take hereunder.

         accordance with the tenor of and written terms of such Liability.

                  (vi)  Any claim to consequential, special, or punitive
         damages.
