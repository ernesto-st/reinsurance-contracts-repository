financial statements of Seller (the "Combined Balance Sheets"). Except as

                  (b)      Except as otherwise stated or disclosed in Schedule
3.7, for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and for the portion of any Straddle Period

the timely filing of) when due (taking into account all properly requested
extensions) all material Tax Returns required by Applicable Law to be filed by
or with respect to URG or URC; all such Tax Returns were true, correct and
complete in all material respects; all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns
and all Taxes of URG or URC (or for which URG or URC could be held liable,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous
provision of state, local or applicable foreign law) that are due and owing,
whether or not shown on any Tax Return, have been timely paid (except for Taxes
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings); no closing
agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any predecessor provision or
similar provision of any state, local or foreign law) has been entered into by
or with respect to URG or URC; and neither URG nor URC has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the

                  3.8.     Required Filings. For all periods ending after May
10, 2000, all material statements, reports, forms or other information required
to be filed with respect to URG or URC have been or will be timely filed, except
where such failure to so file would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and all
such reports were true and correct in all material respects when filed.

                  3.9.     No Breach of Statute or Contract; Governmental
Authorizations.

                  (a)      Neither the execution and delivery by Seller of this
Agreement nor performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder will conflict
with, or result in a breach of, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of:
(i) the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of Seller, URG or URC; (ii) subject
to receipt of approvals referred to in Section 3.9(b), any judgment, order,
injunction, decree or ruling of any court or governmental authority, domestic or
foreign, or any law, statute or regulation, to which Seller, URG or URC is
subject; or (iii) any agreement, contract or commitment to which Seller, URG or
URC is a party or is subject, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)
only, for such conflicts or breaches that would not have a Material Adverse
Effect, would not materially impair the ability of Seller to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under this Agreement, or would not impair the
validity of any Insurance Permit.

                  (b)      To Seller's Knowledge, there are no governmental
approvals required to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except for the approvals: (i) with respect to the change of
control of URC by the insurance commissioner of the State of New Hampshire, (ii)
of the proposed dividend of URC by the insurance commissioner of the State of
New Hampshire, (iii) by the Secretaries of State of New Hampshire and Delaware
and the insurance commissioners of the State of New Hampshire and California of
the URC/URG Merger, and (iv) the insurance department of any other jurisdiction
asserting regulatory authority over the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which are required by applicable law, regulation or rule to be
obtained by Purchaser. Notice of the change in control of URC may be required by
applicable law, regulation or rule of other jurisdictions in which URC has an
Insurance Permit, it being agreed that such notices will be given by Purchaser.

                  (c)      To Seller's Knowledge, each of URG and URC is in
compliance with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, orders, rules and
regulations promulgated, and judgments entered, by any federal, foreign or local
court or governmental authority relating to the operation, conduct or ownership
of the property or business of URG and URC, the failure to comply with which

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

would have a Material Adverse Effect or would result in the material impairment
of any Insurance Permit.

                  (d)      None of Seller, URG or URC has received any notice
of, nor to Seller's Knowledge is there, any violation of any applicable law,
statute, ordinance, order, rule or regulation promulgated, or judgment entered,
by any federal, foreign, state or local court or governmental authority relating
to the operation, conduct or ownership of the business of URG or URC, the
failure to comply with which would have a Material Adverse Effect or would
result in the impairment of any Insurance Permit.

                  (e)      Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.1(b), no proceeding
is pending nor, to Seller's Knowledge, is any proceeding threatened in which any
Person is seeking to revoke or deny the renewal of any Insurance Permit.

                  3.10.    No Litigation or Adverse Events. Other than (i)
applications filed with state insurance departments by Purchaser, (ii)
applications requesting approval of the change in control of URC pursuant to
this Agreement and (iii) claims brought under Policyholder Contracts and
Reinsurance Agreements, there are no actions, suits or administrative,
arbitration or other proceedings or governmental investigations (including
counterclaims) pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened in writing against
URG or URC which, if decided adversely to URG or URC, respectively, would have a
Material Adverse Effect. None of Seller, URG or URC has received any written
notice of, nor to Seller's Knowledge is there, any claim or assertion of
liability on the part of URG or URC, the success of which would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  3.11.    Bank Accounts. Schedule 3.11 sets forth a list of all
bank accounts maintained by URG or URC together with the addresses of the banks
at which such accounts are maintained and the contact persons for URG or URC
thereat.

                  3.12.    Assets and Property. Each of URG and URC's assets and
property consist only of (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) fixed income
securities traded in a recognized public market and (iii) bonds on deposit with
certain states as required to obtain licenses in those states. Schedule 3.12
sets forth a description of the items constituting each of URG and URC's assets
and property, including the values thereof, valued as of March 31, 2003 in
accordance with the valuation methods to be used in the preparation of the
Closing Date Statements of Assets, as set forth in Section 5.5 of this
Agreement.

                  3.13.    Liabilities. To Seller's Knowledge, URC has no
liabilities, losses or known claims relating to any Policyholder Contracts or
Reinsurance Agreements previously issued by URC, and neither of URG nor URC has
any other liabilities, losses or claims (contract or otherwise) other than those
set forth in the Statutory Financial Statements of URC for the period ended
December 31, 2002 and for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2003, or as set
forth in Schedule 3.13; and at the Closing, neither URG nor URC will have any
liabilities or obligations other than those set forth in Schedule 3.13. To
Seller's Knowledge, none of URC's net or gross liabilities under the
Policyholder Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements will be required, under SAP or
GAAP, or by any regulatory authority, to be included in the balance sheets of
URC after the Closing.

                  3.14.    Contracts. To Seller's Knowledge, the agreements set
forth in Schedule 3.14 (collectively, the "URC Agreements") constitute all of
the contracts and commitments by which either of URG or URC is

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

(or, when entered into, will be) bound or to which either of URG or URC is (or,
when entered into, will be) subject, and there are no other contracts or
commitments to which either of URG or URC is now a party or by which either of
URG or URC or their assets may be bound or to which either of URG or URC or
their assets may be subject, other than the agreements set forth in Schedule
3.14, contracts and commitments that will be terminated on or prior to the
Closing and this Agreement. To Seller's Knowledge, pursuant to the Novation
Agreements, SRA was substituted for URC as the reinsurer under approximately 99%
of the Policyholder Contracts and Reinsurance Agreements (other than the
Affiliate Reinsurance Agreements, under all of which SRA was substituted for URC
as the reinsurer pursuant to the Affiliate Novation Agreements). The URC
Agreements are (or, when entered into, will be) and after the Closing will be
valid and binding obligations of each of the parties thereto, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with their terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
Exception.

                  3.15.    Compliance Requirements. Seller has received the
written confirmation of permission from the insurance commissioner of the State
of New Hampshire approving the transfer to SRA of 100% of the past, present and
future liabilities and obligations of URC, both disclosed and undisclosed, a
copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule 3.15.

                  3.16.    Employees and Agents. Neither URG nor URC will have
on the Closing Date any employees, independent insurance agents, brokers or
producers, except for agents appointed solely to maintain Insurance Permits.
Seller acknowledges that Purchaser is assuming no liability or responsibility
with respect to benefits payable or any other obligation owed under any Employee
Benefit Plan of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or for any insurance agent
arrangements which exist or may have existed (including any commissions or fees
owed in connection therewith).

                  3.17.    Powers of Attorney. To Seller's Knowledge, Schedule
3.17 sets forth a list of all powers of attorney granted by URG or URC that have
not expired or been revoked prior to the date hereof.

                  3.18.    Accuracy of Documents. All minute books and stock
records of URG and URC and all other Documents delivered by Seller, URG or URC
to Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby are
complete and accurate in all material respects.

                  3.19.    Brokers and Finders. No broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Seller, URG
or URC.

                  3.20.    Statutory Deposits. URC has on deposit with state
insurance departments an aggregate of approximately $13.0 million. Schedule 3.20
sets forth a list of such deposits in each state.

                                   ARTICLE IV

enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
Exception.

                  4.3.     No Breach of Statute or Contract; Governmental
Authorizations.

                  (a)      Neither the execution and delivery by Purchaser of
this Agreement nor performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder will
conflict with, or result in a breach of, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of: (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of
Purchaser; (ii) any judgment, order, injunction, decree or ruling of any court
or governmental authority, domestic or foreign, or any law, statute or
regulation, to which Purchaser is subject; or (iii) any agreement, contract or
commitment to which Purchaser is a party or is subject, the breach of which
judgment, order, injunction, decree, ruling, law, statute, regulation,
agreement, contract or commitment would materially impair the ability of
Purchaser to execute, deliver or perform its obligations under this Agreement.

                  (b)      To Purchaser's knowledge after reasonable inquiry,

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notice of the
change in control of URC may be required by applicable law, regulation or rule
of other jurisdictions in which URC has an Insurance Permit, it being agreed
that such notices will be given by Purchaser.

                  4.4.     Investment Intent. Purchaser (i) is acquiring the

view to the resale, distribution or other disposition thereof or any part
thereof or any interest therein, and (ii) has such knowledge of and experience
in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its prospective investment in URG and URC as contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges that the Stock will not be registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under any state securities law and,
therefore, may not be sold by Purchaser except pursuant to an effective

registration thereunder and pursuant to registration or qualification under any
applicable state securities law or exemption therefrom.

                  4.5.     No Litigation. There are no actions, suits or

challenge the performance by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  4.6.     Brokers and Finders. No broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby based upon arrangements by or on behalf of Purchaser.

                  4.7.     No Harmful Acts or Omissions. To Purchaser's
knowledge, Purchaser has taken no action and neither acted nor failed to act
where Purchaser had an obligation to so act in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation, impairment or suspension of any License
prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE V

                        CONDUCT AND TRANSACTIONS PRIOR TO
                         CLOSING; COVENANTS; INDEMNITIES

                  5.1.     Investigations; Operation of the Businesses of URG
and URC. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing:

                  (i)      Upon receipt of reasonable notice, Seller will give,
         or cause to be given, to Purchaser or Purchaser's representatives and
         agents reasonable access to the books, records and officers of URG and
         URC and, to the extent that the same pertain to URG or URC, the books
         and records of Seller, and Seller will cause the officers and employees
         of Seller, URG and URC to furnish to Purchaser such financial data and
         other information with respect to the assets and the conduct of the
         business of URG or URC as Purchaser shall from time to time reasonably
         request; provided, however, that any such investigation shall be
         conducted during normal business hours and in such manner so as not to
         interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of Seller,
         URG or URC. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date
         true and complete copies of all Insurance Permits, certified by the
         corporate secretary of URC.

                  (ii)     Purchaser will hold in strict confidence, and will
         cause its employees, representatives, consultants, advisors and
         Affiliates to hold in strict confidence, unless compelled to disclose
         by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of its
         counsel, by other requirements of law, all Confidential Data and
         Confidential Compilations, and Purchaser will not otherwise use such
         Confidential Data or Confidential Compilations for its own benefit or
         for the benefit of other Persons, except to the extent that such
         Confidential Data or Confidential Compilations: (i) are or become known
         in the public domain through no fault of Purchaser; or (ii) are later
         lawfully acquired by Purchaser from other sources unless Purchaser knew
         such Confidential Data or Confidential Compilations were obtained by
         such other source in violation of an agreement of confidentiality;
         provided, however, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
         are consummated, then such Confidential Data and Confidential
         Compilations may be used as the Purchaser sees fit, but only to the
         extent that such Confidential Data and Confidential Compilations relate
         to URG or URC. Purchaser will not release or disclose such Confidential
         Data or Confidential Compilations to any other Person, except its
         auditors, attorneys, commercial bank lenders, financial advisors and
         other consultants and advisors in connection with this Agreement (it
         being understood that such Persons shall be informed by Purchaser of
         the confidential nature of such Confidential Data

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

         and Confidential Compilations and shall agree, for the benefit of
         Seller, to treat such Confidential Data and Confidential Compilations
         confidentially); provided, however, if the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement are consummated, then such Confidential Data and
         Confidential Compilations may be released or disclosed, but only to the
         extent that such Confidential Data or Confidential Compilations relate
         to URG or URC. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
         not consummated or this Agreement is terminated, such confidence shall
         be maintained to the extent required above, and all such information
         shall not be used to the detriment of, or in relation to any investment
         in, URG or URC, and Purchaser shall return to Seller all Confidential
         Data obtained by Purchaser or its advisors, representatives or
         Affiliates from Seller, URG or URC. Purchaser shall use its best
         efforts to destroy or cause to be destroyed all Confidential
         Compilations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
         the covenants of Purchaser set forth in Section 5.1(a)(ii) shall
         survive the cancellation, abandonment or termination of this Agreement.
         It is acknowledged and agreed that unauthorized use of any Confidential
         Data or Confidential Compilations described in Section 5.1(a)(ii) would
         cause irreparable injury constituting the proper subject of injunctive
         relief and specific performance, in addition to providing Seller an
         action for damages.

                  (b)      Seller and Purchaser each agree that it will promptly
make or cause to be made any filing or submission required to be made by it or
on its behalf or on behalf of URC with the insurance commissioners of the State
of New Hampshire and the State of California, and with the insurance department
or similar regulatory authority of any other jurisdiction asserting regulatory
authority over the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (c)      Seller shall provide such assistance as Purchaser may
reasonably request in the preparation of Statutory Financial Statements of URC
for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2003.

                  (d)      Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in using all
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to the Closing hereunder to be
satisfied as soon as practicable including, without limitation, obtaining the
consents, approvals and authorizations necessary for the Closing. For purposes
of this Agreement, the covenant of the parties to use their "reasonable best
efforts" shall not require any party to incur any unreasonable expenses.

                  (e)      Except as otherwise provided for by the terms of this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, Seller will not
permit URG or URC to: (i) issue or sell, or commit to issue or sell, any shares
of its capital stock; (ii) grant or commit to grant any options, warrants or
rights to subscribe for, purchase, or otherwise acquire any shares of its
capital stock; (iii) issue or commit to issue any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of its capital stock; (iv) either declare, set aside,
pay or commit to pay any dividend or other distribution with respect to its
capital stock or transfer any asset for any other purpose; (v) directly or
indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire or dispose of, or commit to
acquire or dispose of, any shares of its capital stock; (vi) effect a split,
modification or reclassification of its capital stock or a recapitalization of
URG or URC; (vii) change the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of URG or URC;
(viii) make, or agree to make, any borrowings or any guarantee, or agree to
guarantee, the borrowings of any other Person; (ix) write any new insurance
business or engage in any business except as may be specifically contemplated in
this Agreement; (x) take any action that would cause URG or URC to incur any
liability whatsoever not fully indemnified hereby or that would have the effect
of impairing the value of the assets or the validity of any Insurance Permit;
(xi) hire any employees; or (xii) except as set

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

forth herein, take any action not in the ordinary course of URG or URC's
business or which would be inconsistent with delivering to Purchaser a
corporation as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement. Further, after
preparation and delivery of the Closing Date Statements of Assets and the
Closing Date Balance Sheets, without the prior written consent of Purchaser
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Seller shall not, nor shall Seller
permit URG or URC to, take any action which would cause or require any changes
to the information set forth in the Closing Date Statements of Assets or the
Closing Date Balance Sheets, or which would cause the sale or disposition of any
assets reflected in the Closing Date Statements of Assets.

                  (f)      Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser and to
cause URC to cooperate with Purchaser in obtaining licenses for URC as a
property and casualty insurance company in those jurisdictions where URC is
currently licensed only as a reinsurer. Seller's cooperation shall be limited to
filing forms and applications prepared by Purchaser on behalf of URC.

                  5.2.     Pending or Threatened Litigation or Action. Between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall each
inform the other, promptly upon Seller's or Purchaser's obtaining knowledge
thereof, of any pending or threatened litigation or action by any regulatory
authority which could reasonably be anticipated (i) to prohibit or restrain or
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the performance by Seller or Purchaser of their respective obligations under
this Agreement, (ii) to have a Material Adverse Effect or (iii) to have the
effect of impairing the value of the assets to be transferred at the Closing or
the validity of any Insurance Permit.

                  5.3.     Tax Audits; Tax Returns and Payments.

                  (a)      Seller shall, or shall cause URG and URC to, prepare
and timely file (or join in the filing of) when due (with extensions) all Tax
Returns of or including the income, assets or operations of URG and URC that are
required to be filed for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and shall timely (with extensions) pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns and information
statements will be prepared and filed by Seller or URG or URC in a manner
reasonably consistent with the prior practice of Seller, URG or URC, as
applicable. None of Seller, URG or URC shall: (i) make any election on any such
Tax Return that would be binding for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date without the consent of the Purchaser; (ii)
enter into, or permit to be entered into, any closing or other agreement with
respect to Taxes of URG or URC affecting or relating to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without the consent of the
Purchaser which shall not be unreasonably withheld; (iii) make or change any
election, change an annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting
method, file any amended Tax Return, settle any claim or assessment with respect
to Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any Tax Claim or assessment relating to URG or URC, or take any similar
action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax if
such election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of
URG or URC for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date (other than decreasing any net operating loss or similar Tax
attribute of URG or URC existing on the Closing Date as a result of the ordinary
course of business of the Seller and URG or URC, as applicable). Purchaser
shall, or shall cause URG and URC to, prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of
or including the income, assets or operations of URG or URC that are required to
be filed with respect to all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date, and
shall timely pay or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown due on such Tax Returns.

                  (b)      Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will provide the
other (and the other's attorneys, accountants and agents) with, and the
Purchaser, after the Closing Date, shall cause each of URG and URC, as
applicable, to provide the Seller (and the Seller's attorneys, accountants and
agents) with, the right, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, to have
access to, and to copy and use, any records or information then in existence and
that are reasonably available to the party to which the request is being made,
and to that party's personnel, that may be relevant for the preparation of any
Tax Returns, the existence or amount of any item listed on the Carryover
Schedule (as defined below), any audit or other examination by any Taxing
Authority, the filing of any claim for a refund of Tax or for the allowance of
any Tax credit, the determination of the requester's adjusted Tax basis in any
asset, or the preparation for, or the conduct of, any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to liability for Taxes. Each of the Seller and Purchaser
shall reimburse the other for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
providing such assistance. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section
5.3(b) shall be held in strict confidence and shall be used solely in connection
with the reason for which it was requested.

                  (c)      Seller shall cause any Tax sharing agreement or
similar arrangement with respect to Taxes involving URG or URC, or to which URG
or URC may be subject, to be terminated effective as of the Closing Date. To the
extent any such agreement or arrangement obligates URG or URC to make any
payments with respect to Taxes after the Closing Date, none of URG, URC or
Purchaser shall have any obligation under any such agreement or arrangement for
any past, present or future period.

                  (d)      On or before the July 30th of the year following the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date, Seller, at its sole cost and
expense, shall prepare a schedule (the "Carryover Schedule") identifying, in
each case as of the close of the taxable year of the Seller in which the Closing
Date occurs and separately calculated for regular tax purposes: (A) each net
operating loss, net capital loss, general business credit, charitable
contributions carryover, foreign tax credit, minimum tax credit, overall foreign
loss and separate limitation foreign loss of each of URG and URC, for the
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (each, a
"Carryover Item"); and (B) the taxable year in which each such Carryover Item
arose. Seller shall determine the existence and amount of each Carryover Item
consistently with the existence and amount of such item as reported by Seller on
its consolidated federal Income Tax Return for the taxable year of Seller that
includes the Closing Date. Seller agrees that within thirty (30) days of any
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code that results
in a change in any Carryover Item on the most recent Carryover Schedule
furnished to the Purchaser, Seller shall provide to the Purchaser written
notification of such determination, as well as an amended Carryover Schedule
reflecting the results of such determination.

                  (e)      In the case of any Tax Return filed by Purchaser, URG
or URC for any Straddle Period of URG or URC, Purchaser shall provide Seller
with copies of the completed Tax Return for such Straddle Period, along with a
statement allocating the aggregate Tax liability shown on such Tax Return
between the Purchaser and Seller pursuant to the principles of Section 5.4(b),
together with such related work papers and other documents as Seller shall
reasonably request, no later than sixty (60) days before the due date for the
filing of such Tax Return. Seller and its authorized representatives shall have
the right to review the Tax Returns, statements and related documents received
from Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.3(e) and, if no issues
arise as a result of such review, Seller shall pay its allocable share of the
aggregate Tax liability shown on such statements within three (3) days of the
due date of such Tax Return (or the due date for the payment of Tax with respect
to such Tax Return, if earlier). Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

each other and resolve in good faith any issues arising under the terms of this
Section 5.3(e) as a result of the review of any such Tax Returns or statement
received from Purchaser. If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within
thirty (30) business days after the receipt of any such Tax Returns or
statement, the parties shall refer the dispute to a nationally-recognized,
mutually agreed-upon accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") for resolution. The
parties shall instruct, and shall use their best efforts to ensure, that the
Accounting Firm's determination shall be made and communicated in writing no
later than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return (or due date
for the payment with respect to such Tax Return, if earlier). Seller will pay to
Purchaser at least three (3) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return (or
the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax Return, if
earlier) the amount of Taxes determined by the Accounting Firm to be allocable
to Seller on the statement. The Accounting Firm's determination shall be final
and binding upon the parties, and all fees and expenses relating to the
engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Seller and the
Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser agree to file all Tax Returns (or amended Tax
Returns, as applicable), consistent with the final determination made by the
Accounting Firm.

                  (f)      If a claim is made or threatened in writing by any
Taxing Authority that, if successful, may result in a payment under Section
5.4(a) hereof (a "Tax Claim"), the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in
writing stating the nature and basis of such claim, and the amount thereof, to
the extent known. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Seller from
any liability that it may have on account of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement, or otherwise unless and to the extent that the Seller is materially
and adversely prejudiced thereby. The Seller will have the right, upon
notification to the Purchaser, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice
of the Tax Claim, to assume at its own expense control of any audit or other
defense of any Tax Claim with its own counsel. If the Seller elects not to
control any audit or other defense of a Tax Claim, the Purchaser may, in its
sole discretion, settle such Tax Claim. The Seller's right to control a Tax
Claim will be limited to issues in respect of which amounts in dispute would be
paid by the Seller or for which the Seller would be liable pursuant to Section
5.4(a) hereof, which determination shall be made by the Purchaser in its
reasonable discretion and in good faith. The Purchaser shall cooperate in good
faith with Seller in contesting any Tax Claim. All reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of the Purchaser related to such cooperation shall be borne by Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) the Seller shall not have the right to
control any issue involved in a Tax Claim unless the Seller first acknowledges
in writing its obligation to fully pay the Taxes asserted in connection with
such issue; (ii) no settlement or disposition of any Tax Claim shall be made by
the Seller without the Purchaser's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld); and (iii) the Purchaser and Seller shall jointly
control all proceedings involving any claims for Taxes assessed in respect of a
Straddle Period and each party shall bear its own out-of-pocket costs and
expenses relating thereto.

                  (g)      The Seller, the Purchaser, URG and URC agree that for
all Income Tax purposes, the taxable period of each of URG and URC shall be
terminated as of the close of business on the Closing Date in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1) (other than transactions properly
allocable thereunder to the portion of the day after the Closing shall occur)
and items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit shall be apportioned based
upon a closing of the books for Tax purposes in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b). No elections shall be made under either
Treasury Regulation 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation of a
year's items) or Treasury Regulation 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) (to ratably allocate
the items for the month which includes the Closing Date). The Seller, the
Purchaser, URG and URC further agree to file all Tax Returns, handle the contest
of any audit and otherwise act for all Tax purposes consistent with the
provisions of this Section 5.3(g).

                  (h)      Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refund (or
reduction in Tax liability) for Taxes assessed in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the portion of a Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date,
net of any tax payable by Purchaser in respect of the receipt of such refund.
Purchaser, URG, URC or any affiliate or successor shall notify Seller promptly
in writing of any Tax refunds (or reduction in Tax liability referenced in the
proceeding sentence). Purchaser, URG and URC or any Affiliate or successor of
any of them shall promptly pay to Seller the amount of such net refund upon
their receipt of such refund in cash or through the reduction of another Tax
liability after the Closing Date. At Seller's option, Purchaser shall apply such
net refund to reduce any outstanding amounts Seller is required to pay under
Section 5.4(a).

                  (i)      Within 30 days of a request therefor by the
Purchaser, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser any information reasonably
requested by the Purchaser and necessary for the Purchaser to apply for the
automatic waiver described in Rev. Proc. 2002-32, 2002-20 I.R.B. 959, or any
similar procedure under Applicable Law.

                  5.4.     Indemnifications, Assumptions of Liability and
Related Matters.

                  (a)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.3(f) and (g)
hereof, Seller shall pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, URG
and URC and each of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees
and agents (the "Purchaser Indemnified Persons") from: (i) all liabilities of
URG and URC for Taxes assessed in respect of, and all costs and expenses of Tax
audits or the preparation of Tax Returns for, all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and
the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; (ii) all
liabilities resulting by reason of the several liability of URG and URC pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of Applicable
Law due to URG or URC having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group during any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; (iii) all liabilities of URG and URC
in respect of Taxes of any other person or entity pursuant to any agreement or
contract, whether written or unwritten, entered into during a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending with the Closing Date, or as
transferee or successor, or otherwise.

                  (b)      In the case of any Straddle Period, Seller shall be
solely responsible for all Taxes of URG and URC (and that portion of URG's and
URC's reasonable out-of-pocket costs for the preparation of each such Tax
Return) attributable to the portion of the period ending on, and that includes,
the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be solely responsible and shall indemnify
Seller for all Taxes imposed on the income or operations of URG and URC and
attributable to the taxable period, or portion thereof, that begins after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of any Tax that is
attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period up to and including the Closing
Date shall be (A) in the case of a Tax that is not Income Tax, the total amount
of such Tax for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period through and including the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
Straddle Period, and (B) in the case of any Tax that is based on any of gross
income, premiums, sales or gross receipts, the Tax that would be due with
respect to the portion of the Straddle Period through and including the Closing
Date, if such portion of the Straddle Period were a separate taxable period,
except that exemptions, allowances, deductions, credits or graduated rates that
are calculated or applied on an annual basis (such as the deduction for
depreciation or capital allowances) shall be apportioned on the basis of the
gross income, premiums, sales or gross receipts for each such period, or if not
based upon such gross income, premiums, sales or gross receipts, then on a per
diem basis.

                  (c)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(f) and (g)
hereof, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser, URG and URC from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, guaranty fund assessment or similar obligation, costs,
expenses (together with reasonable attorneys' fees and all costs and expenses of
enforcing such right of indemnification against Seller), and penalties, if any,
arising out of or based upon the employment of any individual or entity or with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan which at or prior to the Closing Date was
maintained by, contributed to, or with respect to which there was any obligation
or potential obligation including the obligation to contribute by, URG or URC or
any ERISA Affiliate including without limitation any liability: (i) to the PBGC
under Title IV of ERISA; (ii) with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Title
IV of ERISA; (iii) with respect to any notice and benefit continuation
requirements of COBRA; (iv) with respect to any noncompliance with ERISA or any
other applicable laws; and (v) with respect to any suit, proceeding or claim
which is brought against URG or URC, its officers or directors, any Employee
Benefit Plan or any fiduciary or former fiduciary of any such Employee Benefit
Plan; provided, however, that Seller's obligation to indemnify Purchaser, and
URG or URC pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.4(c) shall not apply to
any loss, claim, damage, liability, cost or expense which relates to any
employee whose employment with URG or URC commences on or after the Closing Date
and which (A) is based upon or arose out of an act taken by or omission by URG,
URC or Purchaser with respect to an event occurring after the Closing Date which
event has no connection, directly or indirectly, with any Employee Benefit Plan
or employment arrangement for which URG or URC had (prior to the Closing Date),
or a pre-Closing ERISA Affiliate had, an obligation or potential obligation or
otherwise maintained prior to the Closing Date; or (B) is based upon or arose
out of any Employee Benefit Plan which was not maintained by URG or URC or an
ERISA Affiliate prior to the Closing Date, nor did URG or URC or ERISA Affiliate
have any obligations or potential obligations thereto, and which following the
Closing Date is maintained by Purchaser, any of their Affiliates, URG or URC.
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller to the same extent as
Seller's indemnity of Purchaser set forth in this Section 5.4(c) with respect to
the matters described in clauses (A) and (B) of this proviso.

                  (d)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(f) and (g)
of this Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser, URG and URC and their respective directors, officers
and employees from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
guaranty fund assessments or similar obligations, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and all costs and expenses of enforcing such right of
indemnification against Seller) and penalties, if any, arising out of, based
upon or with respect to: (i) any Policyholder Contract or Reinsurance Agreement;
(ii) the breach of, or failure by Seller or any of its Affiliates to perform or
comply with, any of the covenants, agreements or undertakings to be performed or
complied with by any of them under the URC Agreements; (iii) the breach of, or
failure by Seller to perform or comply with, any of the covenants, agreements or
undertakings to be performed or complied with by Seller under this Agreement;
(iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Seller in this
Agreement; or (v) any liability of URG or URC (whether known or unknown at the
time of execution of this Agreement) based on or arising out of any act,
omission or event occurring prior to the Closing.

                  (e)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(f) and (g)
hereof, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser, URG and URC shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its directors, officers and employees from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, guaranty fund
assessments or similar obligations, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and all costs and expenses of enforcing such right of
indemnification against Purchaser, URG or URC) and

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

penalties, if any, arising out of, based upon or with respect to: (i) the breach
of, or failure by Purchaser to perform or comply with, any of the covenants,
agreements or undertakings to be performed or complied with by Purchaser under
this Agreement; (ii) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser in this Agreement; (iii) any liability of URG or URC (other than any
liability for which Seller is obligated to indemnify Purchaser, URG or URC under
this Section 5.4) based on or arising out of any act, omission or event
occurring after the Closing; and (iv) all liability of URG or URC for Taxes
assessed in respect of all taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date.

                  (f)      For the purposes of administering the indemnification
provisions of this Section 5.4 (except for any Tax Claim subject to Section
5.3(f) hereof), the following procedures shall apply from and after the Closing
Date:

                  (i)      An indemnified party shall notify the Indemnitor of
         any Indemnification Event in writing within 30 days following the
         receipt of notice by the indemnified party of the commencement of any
         action or proceeding or within 60 days of: (A) the awareness of such
         indemnified party of the assertion of any claim against such
         indemnified party; or (B) the discovery by such indemnified party of
         any loss giving rise to indemnity pursuant to this Section 5.4 (any 30
         or 60 day notification requirement shall begin to run, in the case of
         an action which is amended so as to give rise to an Indemnification
         Event, from the first day that the indemnified party is given notice
         that such action is amended to include any claim which is an
         Indemnification Event under this Agreement). Such notification shall
         indicate whether such indemnified party is requesting indemnification
         with respect to such Indemnification Event and the amount of
         indemnification initially anticipated. The failure to notify the
         Indemnitor of any Indemnification Event shall not relieve the
         Indemnitor of its indemnity obligation, unless and to the extent that
         the Indemnitor is materially and actually prejudiced thereby.

                  (ii)     After notification is given as required by Section
         5.4(e)(i) of this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall be entitled (but is
         not obligated) to assume the defense or settlement of any such action
         or proceeding, or to participate in any negotiations or proceedings to
         settle or otherwise eliminate any claim. If the Indemnitor fails to
         confirm in writing within 10 business days of the notification referred
         to above that Indemnitor will assume the defense, the indemnified party
         may engage counsel to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of such
         action or proceeding, and in such event the indemnified party shall
         pursue the defense or settlement of any such action or proceeding in
         good faith and the Indemnitor shall remain liable and responsible for
         all losses in connection therewith, including the indemnified party's
         costs, attorneys' fees and expenses, all as and when incurred by such
         indemnified party.

                  (iii)    In cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the defense
         or settlement with respect to an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor
         shall be entitled to assume such defense or settlement with counsel of
         its own choosing, provided that (except with respect to Tax audits
         subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(f) of this Agreement): (A) the
         indemnified party (and its counsel) shall be entitled to continue to
         participate at its own cost in any such action or proceeding or in any
         negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim
         for which indemnification is being sought; and (B) the Indemnitor shall
         not be entitled to settle, compromise, decline to appeal, or otherwise
         dispose of any such action, proceeding or claim without the consent or
         agreement of the indemnified party (which

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

         consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). However, if
         consent by the indemnified party to settle, compromise, decline to
         appeal, or otherwise dispose of any such action, proceeding or claim is
         unreasonably withheld, the Indemnitor's liability shall be limited to
         the amount for which the Indemnitor agreed with the claimant to settle
         and the Indemnitor shall be responsible for its costs, attorneys' fees
         and expenses to the date such settlement or compromise was rejected by
         the indemnified party. The non-consenting indemnified party shall be
         responsible for all losses exceeding such compromise or settlement
         amount and its own costs, attorneys' fees and expenses incurred from
         and after the date upon which the settlement was rejected by the
         indemnified party through the date upon which such action, proceeding
         or claim is settled or otherwise disposed of or eliminated.
         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, neither party shall,
         without the consent of the other party, settle any action, proceeding
         or claim on terms which provide for (x) criminal sanction or fine
         against the other party, (y) injunctive or other non-monetary relief
         against the other party or (z) a material adverse impact on the
         continuing operations of the other party as determined reasonably by
         such affected other party.

                  (iv)     In any case where an Indemnitor shall have assumed
         the defense or settlement of any action, proceeding or claim and the
         indemnified party is entitled to continue to participate in such
         action, proceeding or claim, and shall have elected to do so, it shall
         do so at its own expense. In no event shall an Indemnitor be liable to
         any indemnified party for the cost of employing or using in-house legal
         counsel regardless of whether such Indemnitor has, or has not, assumed
         the defense or settlement of such action, proceeding or claim.

                  (v)      In the event indemnification is requested, the
         Indemnitor, its representatives and agents shall have reasonable access
         to the books, records and other Documents of the indemnified party or
         parties seeking such indemnification to the extent reasonably requested
         by the Indemnitor in connection with the Indemnitor's defense or
         settlement of any action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that
         such access shall be provided during normal business hours and in such
         manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the
         business of the indemnified party or parties and shall only take place
         in the presence of a representative of the indemnified party or parties
         unless otherwise so agreed; and provided, further, that the indemnified
         party shall not be required to disclose any information with respect to
         itself or any of its Affiliates (or former Affiliates), other than URG
         or URC, and shall not be required to participate in the defense of any
         action, proceeding or claim to be indemnified under this Agreement
         (except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement), unless
         such disclosure or participation is required or reasonably necessary in
         the defense of any action, proceeding or claim to be indemnified under
         this Agreement in which case the reasonable costs of such participation
         shall be fully reimbursed by the indemnified party.

                  (vi)     From the date of this Agreement each party agrees
         that, except as provided below, it shall retain all Documents with
         respect to all material matters pertaining to URG or URC (except to the
         extent that such Documents in the possession of Seller at the Closing
         and relating to URG or URC may be transferred at the Closing to the
         possession of Purchaser, URG or URC). Before disposing of or otherwise
         destroying any such Documents, the possessor thereof shall give
         reasonable notice to such effect and deliver to the other party, at the
         other party's expense and upon its request, a copy of any such
         Documents. In addition, each party to this Agreement agrees to use its
         best efforts to cause its employees (and in the case of Purchaser, the
         employees of URG or URC) to cooperate with and assist the other

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

         party in connection with any claim, action or proceeding for which
         indemnity is sought under this Agreement or with respect to which
         either party has elected to participate in the defense.

                  (vii)    Following payment by an indemnified party of any
         amount for which it is entitled to indemnity, the indemnified party may
         demand in writing that the Indemnitor reimburse the indemnified party
         for such payment. Such written demand shall set forth the basis and
         amount of such payment in reasonable detail and include a copy of any
         supporting invoice, demand(s) against which payment(s) were made and
         all supporting documentation received or prepared by the indemnified
         party. If reimbursement is not made by the Indemnitor within 30
         calendar days of receipt by the Indemnitor of such demand, interest
         shall thereafter accrue and be payable on the amount to which the
         indemnified party is entitled at a rate equal to 6% per annum until
         paid; provided however, if the Indemnitor disputes the amount demanded
         or the basis for indemnification or disputes that the party
         seeking indemnification is entitled thereto, and a final
         determination is made in favor of the indemnified party, the Indemnitor
         shall pay, in addition to the amount of indemnified losses, interest at
         the rate of 6% per annum on such losses from and after the 30th day
         after receipt by the Indemnitor of the indemnified party's demand for
         indemnification and including the 30th day after the date of such final
         determination and from and after the 31st day after such final
         determination at a rate equal to 10% per annum. If an amount paid by
         the Indemnitor pursuant to this Section 5.4 is determined not to have
         been due from the Indemnitor, the indemnified party shall return the
         amount so paid together with interest at a rate of 6% per annum from
         the date payment was made by the Indemnitor until the 30th day after
         such final determination, and at a rate of 10% per annum thereafter,
         until the date such payment is received by the Indemnitor.

                  (g)      All representations, warranties and covenants,
including without limitation any indemnity obligations, of the parties hereto
which are contained in this Agreement, together with the certificates delivered
pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing and remain operative and in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation heretofore or hereafter made
by or on behalf of the parties hereto, except that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.7 and corresponding indemnity obligations
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect only for the
applicable statutes of limitation.

                  5.5      Closing Date Balance Sheets and Closing Date
Statements of Assets. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in the preparation of
the Closing Date Statements of Assets. The Closing Date Statements of Assets
shall be prepared as of the Closing Date no later than the ninth business day
prior to the Closing Date and shall set forth the value of all tangible assets
of each of URG and URC, other than (i) any refunds of Taxes that Purchaser would
be required to remit to Seller pursuant to Section 5.3(h) hereof, and (ii) any
deferred tax asset (including, but not limited to, any deferred tax asset
arising by reason of any Carryover Item or by reason of any asset having a value
(as determined hereunder) less than its adjusted Tax basis), of each of URG and
URC. Assets included on the Closing Date Statements of Assets shall be valued as
follows: (i) cash and cash equivalents shall be valued at face value; and (ii)
investment securities traded in a recognized public market shall be valued at
their closing price (or, if there is no closing price, then the average bid and
asked prices) on the tenth business day prior to the Closing Date as published
in Kenny Information Services or, if not so published, then as stated in The
Wall Street Journal. The Closing Date Statements of Assets shall be delivered to
the parties hereto no later than the eighth business day prior to the Closing
Date. Thereafter, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser no later than
five business days prior to the Closing Date the Closing Date Balance Sheets
reflecting the Closing Date

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

Shareholder's Equity. Deferred Tax liabilities on the Closing Date Balance
Sheets shall be calculated solely by multiplying the sum of the amounts by which
the value (as determined hereunder) of each asset of URG and URC (other than a
Carryover Item) exceeds its respective adjusted Tax basis (reduced, but not
below zero, by the amount by which the value of any asset (other than a
Carryover Item) of URG or URC is less than its adjusted Tax basis) by the
then-highest marginal Federal and California Income Tax rate applicable to
corporations. The Closing Date Balance Sheets shall be in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, with the substance thereof reflecting the values as
provided in the foregoing sentences.

                  5.6.     Transfer Taxes. Seller shall, at its expense, cause
all appropriate stock transfer Tax stamps to be affixed to the certificate or
certificates representing the Stock. The Seller, URG, URC and the Purchaser
shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
applications or other documents regarding any transfer gains or other similar
transfer Taxes that become payable in connection with the sale of the Stock
(other than the stock transfer taxes mentioned above) pursuant to this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). The Seller shall pay all Transfer Taxes, if
any, shown as due on such returns.

                  5.7.     Conduct of Business by Purchaser. Purchaser covenants
that it shall not, and it shall not permit URG or URC to, take any action that
would cause URG or URC to incur any liability whatsoever until the day following
the Closing Date including, without limitation, the commencement of operations
by URG or URC, the hiring of employees or insurance agents for URG or URC, the
writing of any insurance business by URG or URC or engaging in any business by
URG or URC, amending or modifying any governing document of URG or URC or the
taking of any other action whatsoever which obligates URG or URC to act or omit
to act.

                  5.8.     Change of Name. As promptly as practicable after the
Closing, each of URG and URC shall change its name so that each of URG and URC
does not have the word "Underwriters" in its name, and URC shall cease using the
word "Underwriters" in any of its business dealings. Seller shall retain all
rights of URG and URC to use the names Underwriters Re Group, Inc. and
Underwriters Reinsurance Company.

                  5.9.     Disclosure of Confidential Information. Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective officers and
directors not to, disclose any Confidential Information after the date hereof to
any third party, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative
process or, in the opinion of its counsel, by other requirements of law. It is
acknowledged and agreed that unauthorized use of any Confidential Information
would cause irreparable injury constituting the proper subject of injunctive
relief and specific performance, in addition to providing Purchaser an action
for damages.

                  5.10.    Execution of the Revised Service Agreement. Prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall cause URC, SRA and Seller to terminate the
Service Agreements and to enter into the Revised Service Agreement.

                  5.11.    Policyholder Contracts and Reinsurance Agreements.
After the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, cause to be issued any Policyholder Contracts or Reinsurance
Agreements (other than endorsements thereon or changes in coverage thereunder)
on behalf of the URC.

                  5.12.    URC/URG Merger. Seller shall use its reasonable
efforts for the URC/URG merger to be approved prior to the Closing Date.

and remain pending before a court or other governmental body (foreign or
domestic) to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the sale of the Stock to Purchaser or the

shall any governmental agency or body have notified either party to this
Agreement or URG or URC that the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement would constitute a violation of the laws of the United States

that it intends to commence proceedings to restrain consummation of such
transactions, to force divestiture if such transactions are consummated or to
materially modify the terms or the results of such transactions unless such
agency or body shall have withdrawn such notice prior to the Closing Date.

                  (c)      All authorizations, consents and approvals: (i) with

on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of counsel, provided that the obligations of the parties under
Section 8.3 and the obligations of Purchaser under Section 5.1(a)(ii) shall
survive any such termination. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.3(b) or Section 6.3(c) shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies
available to each of the parties under applicable law, including the right to
recover all expenses, costs and other damages, but no party shall be entitled to

amended, modified or supplemented except upon execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived in writing at any
time by or on behalf of the party which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement by either party hereto shall
be binding only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of such provision, and no waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

                  8.2.     Integrated Contract. This Agreement and the Schedules
and Exhibits to this Agreement (which constitute part of this Agreement) and the
other documents and writings referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. This

Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties

the URG Stock Purchase Agreement of the parties thereto, and there shall be no
set-off rights against payments due under this Agreement with respect of any
payments due under the URG Stock Purchase Agreement and vice versa.

                  8.3.     Publicity. The parties will consult with each other
and will mutually agree upon any publication or press release of any nature with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) and shall not issue any such
publication or press release prior to such consultation and agreement, except as
may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any securities exchange or any securities exchange regulation, in
which case the party proposing to issue such publication or press release shall
use reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such publication or press release.

                  8.4.     Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations
