<p align=center><font size=3>WITNESSETH,</font></p>

<p><font size=3>WHEREAS,
the Applicant; individually; jointly with others or on behalf of any of its
subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions or their subsidiaries, affiliates or

<p><font size=3>NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the execution of any such bond or bonds or the
forbearance of cancellation of existing Bonds and as an inducement to such

prosecuting or defending any action brought in connection therewith, obtaining
a release therefrom, recovering or attempting to recover any salvage in
connection therewith or enforcing by litigation or otherwise any of the
agreements herein contained. Payment of amounts due Surety hereunder together

cover such reserve and any increase thereof, at anytime, in payment or
compromise of any liability, claims, demands, judgment, damages, fees and
disbursements or other expenses; and the Undersigned, in the event of their
failure to comply with such demand, hereby authorize and empower any attorney of
any court of record of the United States or any of its territories or
possessions, to appear for them or any of them in any suit by Surety and to
