                                 LOAN AGREEMENT

     This Loan  Agreement  ("AGREEMENT")  is  entered  into as of June 25,  2001
between GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION, a New York corporation ("LENDER"),
and WELLSFORD/WHITEHALL  HOLDINGS,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
("BORROWER").  Capitalized  terms used in the  Recitals  shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms hereinbelow.

                                    RECITALS

     WHEREAS,  Borrower  desires to obtain the Loan from Lender for the purposes
of (i)  financing  or  refinancing  the  Properties  to repay  certain  existing
indebtedness  and to return a portion of  Borrower's  equity,  and (ii)  funding
Working Capital Advances;

     WHEREAS,  Borrower and Lender desire to set forth the terms and  conditions
of the Loan and of each Advance made hereunder;

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual promises  contained herein
and the payment of $10 and other good and  valuable  consideration,  the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,  Lender and Borrower agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                               CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

SECTION 1.1 CERTAIN  DEFINITIONS.  As used herein,  the following terms have the
meanings indicated:


(1)  "ADJUSTED  ANNUAL  DEBT  SERVICE"  means,  as of the  date of  calculation,
     subject to the adjustment set forth below in this paragraph, the sum of (a)
     annual debt service on the Nomura Loan (taking into account, in the case of
     a request to permit the release of a Nomura  Property  from the Nomura Loan
     Documents,  the  reduction in such annual debt service  resulting  from the
     reduction in the Nomura Loan in  connection  with such  release),  plus (b)
     annual debt service at the then  current  interest  rate payable  under the
     Loan,  calculated on the outstanding balance of the Loan on the calculation
     date  (taking  into  account,  in the case of a release of a Property,  the
     application of the Release Payment or Nomura Payment, as applicable, to the
     outstanding  balance of the Loan),  provided  in each case that such annual
     debt  service on the Loan shall be reduced by amounts that would be payable
     (based on such  interest  rate) to Borrower  under any interest  rate swap,
     cap,  collar or similar  agreement  entered into by Borrower in  connection
     with the Loan,  provided  the  benefits  of such  agreement  are pledged to
     Lender as further security for the Loan. Any calculation of Adjusted Annual
     Debt Service  during,  or as a condition to, an extension of the Term shall
     include in the  amount of annual  debt  service  on the Loan the  principal
     amortization  payments to be made for such  period,  as required by Section
     2.3(2).

(2)  "ADJUSTED LOAN BASIS" means,  with respect to any Property,  the amount set
     forth  opposite the  reference to such  Property in Schedule  1.1(B) hereto
     under the caption  "Loan Basis," and as such Loan Basis may be increased or
     decreased pursuant to the terms hereof.

(3)  "ADJUSTED  OPERATING  CASH FLOW" shall mean, as of any date, (a) cumulative
     annualized Gross Receipts from all Properties,  based on Tenants who are in
     occupancy and current on their rental and other payment  obligations  as of
     such date, less (b) cumulative  Operating Expenses (excluding debt service)
     for all Properties for the twelve (12)  calendar-month  period prior to the
     date of calculation;  provided that the  calculation of Adjusted  Operating
     Cash Flow shall exclude Gross Receipts from, or Operating  Expenses related
     to, (i) any interest rate swap, cap, collar,  or similar  agreement entered
     into by  Borrower  in  connection  with the Loan,  and (ii) any  Properties
     previously released or to be released in connection with the calculation of
     Adjusted Operating Cash Flow.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  no lump sum
     nonrecurring  Operating Expense or Gross Receipt, as reasonably  determined
     by Lender,  shall be included in determining  annualized Adjusted Operating
     Cash Flow for purposes of this definition.  Similarly, the determination of
     annualized  Adjusted  Operating  Cash Flow for  purposes of this  paragraph
     shall  be  adjusted,   as  reasonably  determined  by  Lender,  to  reflect
     annualized  decreases or increases in Operating  Expenses or Gross Receipts
     resulting from  anticipated  major events.  The  determination  of Adjusted
     Operating Cash Flow for purposes of this definition shall be based upon the
     lesser of market  occupancy or the actual  occupancy  rate of each Property

     2.1(5) hereto. Unless Lender otherwise consents in writing,  Borrower shall
     not, on a cumulative,  aggregate  basis,  reallocate more than five percent
     (5.0%) of the Loan funds among categories  within a Working Capital Budget.
     Subject to Lender's prior written  consent in each  instance,  Borrower may
     reallocate  demonstrated surplus Loan funds (i) among categories within any
     Working  Capital  Budget  (except  that such consent is not required to the
     extent such  reallocation  is  permitted  under the  immediately  preceding
     sentence),  or (ii)  subject  to  subparagraph  (g)(iii)  below,  under any
     Working  Capital Budget to the Working  Capital Budget of one or more other
     Properties  (whether such  reallocation  is requested in connection  with a
     sale of a Property, or otherwise).

(2)  Unless Lender otherwise consents in writing,  the Capital  Expenditures for
     which  Working  Capital  Advances are  available  shall be limited to those
     Capital  Expenditures  set forth in the  two-year  capital  budget  for the
     Properties approved by Lender as a condition to the Initial Advance.

(3)  As to each Working Capital Advance, Borrower shall have satisfied the terms
     and conditions set forth in Parts B and C of Schedule 2.1 hereto.

(4)  The amount of each  Working  Capital  Advance  shall in no event exceed the
     least of:


(1)  an amount which,  when added to the  aggregate  amount of all prior Working
     Capital Advances, equals the Working Capital Advance Allocation;

(2)  subject to paragraph  (e) below,  an amount  which,  when added to the Loan
     balance and all undisbursed Loan funds allocated to the Mount Airy Holdback
     and the Gateway Tower  Holdback,  is equal to the lesser of (A) the Cash On
     Cash Limit Amount and (B) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio Limit Amount;

(3)  eighty percent (80%) of the actual costs incurred by Borrower or the Nomura
     Borrower in respect of the Tenant  Improvements,  Leasing  Costs or Capital
     Expenditures for which such Advance is requested.

     In no event shall any Working  Capital  Advance be used to pay or reimburse
     Borrower for any commissions,  fees,  expenses or costs charged by or to be
     paid  for  services  rendered  by  Borrower  or  the  Nomura  Borrower,  or
     Affiliates  of either of them,  unless,  as to such  Affiliates  only,  the
     contractual  arrangements  with such  Affiliates  fully comply with Section
     9.6(1)(b).

(5)  Each  Working  Capital  Advance  shall be in an  amount  not less  than Two
     Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000).

(6)  No Working Capital Advances may be made for any Property until Borrower has
     complied  with  Section  8.15  with  respect  to the  Initial  Advance.  In
     addition, each Working Capital Advance shall be covered by an interest rate
     cap agreement in accordance with Section 8.15 below.

(7)  As to any Working  Capital  Advance for a Nomura  Property,  the  following
     additional conditions shall apply:

(1)  The  Borrower  shall have  received  at least one  Advance  from the Nomura
     Holdback;

(2)  If the requested Advance is for Tenant  Improvements  and/or Leasing Costs,
     the Nomura Borrower shall have fully exhausted the "Rollover  Reserve Fund"
     (as  defined in the Nomura Loan  Agreement),  provided  that the  foregoing
     shall not prohibit  Borrower from requesting the Advance  concurrently with
     the Nomura Borrower's request of such funds from the Nomura Lender (so that
     the Advance is made at  substantially  the same time, but not before,  such
     funds are exhausted);

(3)  If the requested Advance is for Capital  Expenditures,  the Nomura Borrower
     shall have fully  exhausted  the "Capital  Reserve Fund" (as defined in the
     Nomura Loan  Agreement),  provided  that the  foregoing  shall not prohibit
     Borrower  from  requesting  the  Advance   concurrently   with  the  Nomura
     Borrower's  request  of such  funds  from the  Nomura  Lender  (so that the
     Advance is made at substantially the same time, but not before,  such funds
     are exhausted); and


(4)  The Nomura  Properties  shall have  maintained  (or  exceeded) the "Manager
     Termination  Ratio" (as described in the Nomura Loan  Agreement) as of each
     of the three (3) "DSCR Determination  Dates" (as defined in the Nomura Loan
     Agreement)  immediately  preceding the date of the requested  Advance,  and
     Borrower shall have delivered to Lender copies of the evidence delivered to
     the Nomura  Lender  (pursuant to Section 9.5 of the Nomura Loan  Agreement)
     that the Nomura  Properties have met or exceeded such ratio as of each such
     date.  Alternatively,  Borrower  shall have delivered to Lender an estoppel
     from the Nomura  Lender  stating that to the knowledge of the Nomura Lender
     (or of the  servicer  of the Nomura  Loan),  the Nomura  Borrower is not in
     default under the Nomura Loan.

(8)  As to any Working Capital Advance for the Shattuck Office Center  Property,
     the Borrower shall have received the Advance of the Shattuck  Office Center
     Holdback.

(9)  Except as  provided  below in this  paragraph  (i),  Lender  shall  have no
     obligation  to make any Working  Capital  Advances  after the end of second
     Loan Year, and any undisbursed Working Capital Allocation shall be canceled
     as of the last day of the second Loan Year. If Borrower enters into a Lease
     in accordance  with the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to the
     end of the second  Loan Year,  then  Borrower  may obtain  Working  Capital
     Advances for Leasing  Costs and Tenant  Improvements  associated  with such
     Lease  after  the  second  Loan  Year,  provided  that  Borrower  otherwise
     satisfies all  conditions  set forth in this Agreement to such Advances and
     in no event shall  Lender be  obligated to make any Advance with respect to
     such a Lease after the end of the sixth month of the third Loan Year.

(6)  HOLDBACK  ADVANCES.  Lender  shall  make  Advances  from the  Holdbacks  to
     Borrower provided that, as to each such Advance:

(1)  Borrower  shall have satisfied the terms and conditions set forth in Part B
     of Schedule 2.1 hereto;

(2)  Borrower  shall  have  satisfied  the  additional  disbursement  conditions
     applicable  to the Holdback  from which such Advance is  requested,  as set
     forth in Part D of Schedule 2.1 hereto; and

(3)  Each  Advance  from a Holdback  shall be covered  by an  interest  rate cap
     agreement in accordance with Section 8.15 below.

(7)  TIMING OF ADDITIONAL  ADVANCES.  Each Advance following the Initial Advance
     shall be made no later  than  5:00 p.m.  (New York City  time) on the fifth
     (5th)  Business  Day after  receipt  by  Lender  of a Notice of  Additional
     Advance for the requested  Advance and  satisfaction  of all  conditions to
     making such  Advance (as  specified in this Section 2.1 and in Schedule 2.1
     hereof).


(8)  NO  REVOLVING  ADVANCES.  The  Loan is not a  revolving  credit  loan,  and
     Borrower is not entitled to any readvances of any portion of the Loan which
     it may (or is otherwise  required to) prepay  pursuant to the provisions of
     this Agreement.

SECTION 1.3 INTEREST RATE; LATE CHARGE.

(1)  CONTRACT RATE. The outstanding principal balance of the Loan (including any
     amounts added to principal under the Loan Documents) shall bear interest at
     a rate of interest equal to two hundred ninety (290) basis points in excess
     of the LIBOR Rate (the "CONTRACT RATE").

(2)  COMPUTATION  OF  INTEREST.  Interest  shall be  computed  on the basis of a
     fraction,  the  denominator  of which is three  hundred sixty (360) and the
     numerator  of which is the actual  number of days  elapsed from the date of
     the Initial Advance or the date on which the immediately  preceding payment
     was due.

(3)  LATE  CHARGE.  If  Borrower  fails to pay any  installment  of  interest or
     principal  within  five (5) days  after  the date on which  the same is due
     (other than the payment due on the Maturity  Date),  Borrower  shall pay to
     Lender a late charge on such past-due amount, as liquidated damages and not
     as a penalty, equal to two percent (2%) of such amount, notwithstanding the
     date on which such payment is actually paid to Lender;  provided,  however,
     that  if  any  court  of  competent   jurisdiction   determines  that  such
     delinquency  charge under this Section 2.2(3) is not liquidated damages for
     such delinquency (as contemplated by Borrower and Lender), and is deemed to
     be  interest  in  excess  of the  maximum  amount of  interest  allowed  by
     applicable Law, the amount  actually  collected by Lender in excess of such
     lawful amount shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section
     11.3  hereof.  While any  Event of  Default  exists,  the Loan  shall  bear
     interest at the Default Rate.

SECTION 1.4 TERMS OF PAYMENT. The Loan shall be payable as follows:

(1)  INTEREST.  Commencing  on August 1, 2001,  Borrower  shall pay  interest in
     arrears on the first  Business  Day of each month  (the  "INTEREST  PAYMENT
     DATE") until the Maturity Date, when all amounts secured by and outstanding
     under the Loan Documents shall be paid in full.

(2)  PRINCIPAL  AMORTIZATION.  During  the  initial  Term,  the Loan shall be an
     interest-only loan and Borrower shall not be required to make any regularly
     scheduled principal  amortization payments. If the Term is extended for one
     or both of the 12-month periods contemplated by Section 2.3(3) below (each,
     an "EXTENSION  PERIOD"),  then commencing on August 1, 2004, and continuing
     on each Interest  Payment Date thereafter until all Obligations are paid in
     full,  Borrower  shall make  monthly  principal  amortization  payments  in
     accordance with this Section 2.3(2), which payments shall be applied to the
     outstanding  principal  balance  of the Loan.  For each  Extension  Period,
     Lender shall calculate the total amount of principal  payments  payable for
     such  Extension  Period  based  upon a 25-year  amortization  schedule,  an
     amortization  period which begins on July 1, 2004,  a fixed  interest  rate
     equal to the Contract Rate in effect as of July 1 of such Extension Period,
     and the  outstanding  principal  balance  of the  Loan as of July 1 of such
     Extension Period. The amount of the monthly principal  amortization payment
     for a given Extension Period shall be the amount determined by dividing the
     aggregate amount of all monthly principal amortization payments payable for
     such Extension  Period  (calculated as set forth above) by twelve (12). The
     foregoing  notwithstanding,  upon application of any Release Payment to the
     Loan  balance  or  any  other  prepayment  of  the  Loan  (other  than  the
     amortization  payments  required  by this  Section  2.3(2)),  Lender  shall
     recalculate the amount of the monthly principal amortization payments owing
     for the remainder of the then current Extension Period,  based upon the new
     Loan  balance  and the  Contract  Rate  then in  effect,  and such  revised
     principal  amortization  payment  shall  be due  commencing  on  the  first
     Interest Payment Date occurring after the date the Release Payment is made.

(3)  MATURITY.   On  the  Maturity  Date,  Borrower  shall  pay  to  Lender  all
     outstanding  principal,  accrued and unpaid interest, and any other amounts
     due under the Loan Documents.  Subject to the provisions of this paragraph,
     Borrower,  at its option, may extend the Term for two (2) 12-month periods,
     by giving written notice (the  "EXTENSION  NOTICE") to Lender of Borrower's
     election to obtain each such  extension not less than sixty (60) days prior
     to the expiration of the original Term or the first  extension  period,  as
     applicable.  If  Borrower  elects to so extend  the Term,  all of the other
     terms and conditions of this  Agreement and the other Loan Documents  shall
     remain in full force and effect and unmodified  except that all undisbursed
     Loan funds not  previously  canceled  (if any) shall be  canceled as of the
     original  Maturity Date and Borrower  shall have no further right to extend
     the Term after the second extension. Borrower's right to extend the Term is
     subject to the satisfaction of each of the following  conditions as to each
     extension:

(1)  No Event of Default has  occurred  and is  continuing  on the date on which
     Borrower gives Lender the Extension  Notice and on the last day of the then
     existing Term;

(2)  The Cash On Cash Return equals or exceeds thirteen percent (13.0%), and (b)
     the Debt Service  Coverage Ratio equals or exceeds 1.35 to 1.00;  provided,
     however,  that if, based on the outstanding  Loan balance as of the date of
     calculation,  Borrower  fails to satisfy the foregoing  Cash On Cash Return
     and/or Debt Service Coverage Ratio condition(s),  Borrower may satisfy such
     condition(s) by paying down the outstanding Loan balance to an amount which
     would result in such condition(s) being satisfied;

(3)  Borrower  shall  have  paid to  Lender  an  extension  fee (for  each  such
     extension)  equal to one-quarter of one percent  (0.25%) of the outstanding
     principal  balance  of the Loan (it being the  parties'  understanding  and
     agreement  that any portion of the Maximum Loan Amount which is undisbursed
     as of the end of the initial Term shall be canceled and no longer available
     for disbursement);

(4)  Borrower shall have provided Lender with evidence  reasonably  satisfactory
     to Lender that  Borrower has an interest  rate cap agreement in place which
     complies  with  Section  8.15 (and will comply  therewith  throughout  such
     extension);

(5)  Borrower  shall  have  provided  Lender  (at  Borrower's  expense)  updated
     environmental  reports and engineering  reports for each of the Properties,
     in form and substance satisfactory Lender;

(6)  Borrower  shall execute and deliver such other  instruments,  certificates,
     opinions of counsel and documentation as Lender shall reasonably request in
     order to  preserve,  confirm  or secure the Liens and  security  granted to
     Lender by the Loan Documents,  including any amendments,  modifications  or
     supplements to any of the Loan  Documents,  endorsements  to Title Policies
     and, if required by Lender, estoppel and other certificates; and

(7)  Borrower  shall  pay for any and all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs  and
     expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,  incurred
     by Lender in connection with or arising out of the extension of the Term.

(4)  PREPAYMENT. Except as provided below, at any time during the Term, upon not
     less than ten (10)  days'  prior  written  notice to Lender,  Borrower  may
     prepay the Loan in whole or in part  without  premium or penalty,  provided
     that each such  prepayment  shall be  accompanied by the payment of accrued
     and unpaid interest on the principal amount being prepaid, through the date
     of prepayment,  and any other costs or expenses which are payable to Lender
     in  accordance  with the  terms  hereof  or any other  Loan  Document.  The
     foregoing notwithstanding,  during the first Loan Year prepayment (in whole
     or in part)  shall only be  permitted  in  connection  with a sale or other
     transfer of a Property to a Person which is not an Affiliate of Borrower or
     of any  Borrower  Party.  From and after the  beginning  of the second Loan
     Year,  Loan  shall  be  closed  to  partial  prepayment  from  a  Refinance
     (including  a  Refinance  of  any  or all  of  the  Nomura  Properties).  A
     prepayment premium equal to two percent (2.0%) of the outstanding principal
     balance of the Loan shall be payable if an Event of Default  occurs and the
     Loan is  accelerated  prior to the  commencement  of the second  Loan Year.
     Borrower  acknowledges that the prepayment premium required by this Section
     2.3(4)  constitutes  partial  compensation  to  Lender  for  the  costs  of
     reinvesting the Loan proceeds and for loss of the contracted rate of return
     on the Loan.  Furthermore,  Borrower acknowledges that the loss that may be
     sustained  by Lender  as a result of such  prepayment  by  Borrower  is not
     susceptible of precise  calculation and the prepayment  premium  represents
     the good faith effort of Borrower and Lender to compensate  Lender for such
     loss.  Borrower  confirms that  Lender's  agreement to make the Loan at the
     interest rate and on the other terms set forth herein constitutes  adequate
     and valuable  consideration,  given individual weight by Borrower,  for the
     prepayment provision set forth in this Section.

(5)  EARLY LOAN ACCELERATION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
     in this Agreement,  if at any time the outstanding principal balance of the
     Loan is less than Thirty-Five Million Dollars  ($35,000,000),  Lender shall
     have the right to accelerate the Loan,  whereupon all amounts due under the
     Loan Documents  shall become due and payable without any penalty or premium
     on the date which is ninety (90) days (the "EARLY  TERMINATION DATE") after
     the date  that  Lender  provides  Borrower  with  notice  of its  intent to
     accelerate the Loan pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph;  provided
     that  Borrower  shall have the right to repay the Loan  without  penalty or
     premium  (including the premium  contemplated  in Section 2.3(4) above,  if
     payable)  on any  earlier  date after  Borrower's  receipt of such  notice.
     Borrower  shall  pay  to  Lender,  in  immediately   available  funds,  all
     outstanding  principal,  accrued and unpaid interest, and any other amounts
     due under the Loan  Documents  as of the Early  Termination  Date (or as of
     such earlier date on which Borrower  elects to repay the Loan, as permitted
     in this paragraph).

(6)  APPLICATION  OF PAYMENTS.  All  payments  received by Lender under the Loan
     Documents  shall be applied:  first, to any fees and expenses due to Lender
     under the Loan  Documents;  second,  to any Default  Rate  interest or late
     charges;  third,  to  accrued  and  unpaid  interest;  and  fourth,  to the
     principal sum and other amounts owing under the Loan Documents.

(7)  LENDER ADVANCES TO COVER BORROWER'S PAYMENTS.  Lender is authorized to, and
     at is sole option may,  make  advances on behalf of Borrower for payment of
     all fees,  expenses,  charges,  costs,  principal,  interest and other sums
     incurred or payable by  Borrower  hereunder  when and as Borrower  fails to
     promptly pay any such amounts (after any applicable  grace period).  To the
     extent permitted by Law, any such advances made by Lender shall be added to
     the  Obligations,  shall bear interest from the date advanced until paid at
     the Default Rate and shall be secured by the Collateral.

(8)  RECEIPT OF PAYMENTS.  Borrower shall make each payment under this Agreement
     not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due in lawful
     money of the United  States of America in  immediately  available  funds to
     Lender's  depository bank in the United States as designated by Lender from
     time to time for deposit in Lender's depositary account.  For purposes only
     of computing interest hereunder, all payments shall be applied by Lender to
     the Loan on the date payment has been credited by Lender's  depository bank
     to Lender's account in immediately available funds.

SECTION  1.5  COLLATERAL;  RELEASES  OF  COLLATERAL.  The  Loan  and  all  other
Obligations  (other than Borrower's  Obligations under the Hazardous  Substances
Indemnity Agreement) shall be secured by the Collateral. Except as expressly set
forth below in this  Section,  Lender shall have no obligation to release any of
the Collateral  until all  Obligations  have been paid and performed in full and
all obligations of Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents have
terminated.  Borrower  shall be  entitled  to obtain  the  release of a Borrower
Property  from the Lien of the  Loan  Documents  in  connection  with a  Capital
Transaction  (excluding a Capital Transaction consisting of an event giving rise
to an insurance recovery or condemnation  award in excess of  repair/restoration
costs), provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(1)  Borrower provides Lender with reasonable prior written notice (the "PARTIAL
     RELEASE  NOTICE")  of the  proposed  release  together  with  copies of any
     documents  which Borrower  requests that Lender execute in connection  with
     such proposed release.

(2)  Concurrently  with Lender's release of the Property,  Borrower shall pay to
     Lender an amount (the "RELEASE Payment") determined as follows:

(1)  if the release occurs during the first Loan Year, the Release Payment shall
     be the greater of (i) one hundred  twenty  percent  (120%) of the  Adjusted
     Loan Basis of the  Property to be  released,  and (ii) the  minimum  amount
     which, when applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, would
     result  in a Cash On Cash  Return  of at  least  ten and  one-half  percent
     (10.5%) and a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.20 to 1.0;

(2)  if the  release  occurs  during the second Loan Year,  the Release  Payment
     shall be the  greater  of (i) one  hundred  twenty  percent  (120%)  of the
     Adjusted  Loan Basis of the Property to be  released,  and (ii) the minimum
     amount  which,  when applied to the  outstanding  principal  balance of the
     Loan,  would  result in a Cash On Cash  Return of at least  eleven  percent
     (11%) and a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.0;

(3)  if the release occurs after the second Loan Year, the Release Payment shall
     be the greater of (i) one hundred  twenty  percent  (120%) of the  Adjusted
     Loan Basis of the  Property to be  released,  and (ii) the  minimum  amount
     which, when applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, would
     result in a Cash On Cash  Return of at least  eleven and  one-half  percent
     (11.5%) and a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.30 to 1.0;

(4)  notwithstanding  subparagraphs  (a), (b) and (c) above, the Release Payment
     shall be equal to one hundred  fifteen  percent (115%) of the Adjusted Loan
     Basis of the  Property  to be  released  if,  after  giving  effect  to the
     proposed release,  the Cash On Cash Return is at least twelve percent (12%)
     and the Debt Service Coverage Ratio is at least 1.30 to 1.0;

(5)  notwithstanding  subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, if the Property
     to be released is a Designated Property, the Release Payment shall be equal
     to one  hundred  five  percent  (105%) of the  Adjusted  Loan  Basis of the
     Designated  Property  to be  released  if (i) the  release  occurs (and the
     Release  Payment is paid) within the first six (6) months after the Closing
     Date,  and (ii)  after  giving  effect  to the  proposed  release,  (A) the
     aggregate  amount of  Release  Payments  paid with  respect  to  Designated
     Properties  is less  than  $50,000,000,  (B) the Cash On Cash  Return is at
     least ten and one-half percent  (10.5%),  and (C) the Debt Service Coverage
     Ratio is at least 1.20 to 1.0;

provided,  however,  if the release  involves an Impaired  Property or a Default
Property (pursuant to Borrower's rights to obtain a release of such Property set
forth elsewhere in this  Agreement),  then the Release Payment shall be equal to
the Adjusted Loan Basis of such Property.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  in no
event shall the Release  Payment for any  Property  exceed the then  outstanding
Obligations.

(3)  No release shall be permitted (except in connection with the full repayment
     of the  Loan  and  termination  of  Lender's  obligations  under  the  Loan
     Documents) if, after giving effect to such release, either of the following
     circumstances exist:

(1)  all of the Borrower Properties have been released; or

(2)  the outstanding  balance of the Loan is less than $100,000,000 and the Cash
     On Cash Return is less than twelve percent (12%);  provided,  however, that
     if Borrower fails to satisfy the foregoing  Cash On Cash Return  condition,
     then Borrower may satisfy such condition by paying down  (concurrently with
     such release) the outstanding  Loan balance to an amount which would result
     in such Cash On Cash Return condition being satisfied.

(4)  Except as provided in this paragraph,  no Event of Default has occurred and
     is  continuing  on the date on which  Borrower  gives  Lender  the  Partial
     Release  Notice  and on the  date of  delivery  of the  release;  provided,
     however,  if the Property to be released is a Default Property and the only
     Event of Default  which  exists is the Event of Default  which  caused such
     Property to be designated as a Default  Property (and which arises from the
     occurrence  of a breach,  default,  failure of condition or other event for
     which no cure period is provided),  then this condition  shall be waived so
     long as the  Default  Property  is  released  within 10 days of notice from
     Lender,  as required in the last  paragraph of Section  10.1.  In addition,
     Lender shall release a Property  which is the subject of a Complete  Taking
     notwithstanding  the  existence of an Event of Default,  if and only if (a)
     Borrower has otherwise  satisfied the  conditions set forth in this Section
     2.4 to the release of such  Property,  and (b) Borrower pays to Lender,  as
     the Release  Payment for such Property,  an amount equal to 100% of the Net
     Capital  Proceeds  from the  Complete  Taking (it being  understood  by the
     parties  that if no Event  of  Default  exists,  the  amount  to be paid by
     Borrower  shall be the Release  Payment as determined  in  accordance  with
     paragraph (2) above).

(5)  Borrower  shall execute and deliver such other  instruments,  certificates,
     opinions of counsel and documentation as Lender shall reasonably request in
     order to  preserve,  confirm  or secure the Liens and  security  granted to
     Lender by the Loan Documents,  including any amendments,  modifications  or
     supplements to any of the Loan Documents and partial  release  endorsements
     to the existing Title Policies.

(6)  Borrower  shall  pay for any and all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs  and
     expenses  incurred  in  connection  with any  proposed  release,  including
     reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements  and all  title  insurance
     premiums for any  endorsements  to any existing Title  Policies  reasonably
     required by Lender in connection with such proposed release.

(7)  Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender
     that all amounts  owing to any parties in connection  with the  transaction
     relating  to  the  proposed   release  have  been  paid  in  full,  or  are
     simultaneously  paid in full at closing,  or adequate Reserves therefor are
     established  by  Borrower  in cash  with  respect  to  contingent  or other
     liabilities that may arise out of such transaction.


(8)  Unless the proposed  release will repay the Loan in full (and terminate all
     of Lender's  obligations  hereunder),  or the proposed  release involves an
     Impaired Property or a Default Property, the release shall be in connection
     with a sale or other  transfer of the  Property to a Person which is not an
     Affiliate of Borrower or of any  Borrower  Party.  If the proposed  release
     involves an Impaired Property or a Default Property, then concurrently with
     the release  Borrower shall transfer the Property to an entity which may be
     related to  Borrower,  so long as  Borrower is not  directly or  indirectly
     liable  on a  recourse  basis  for any of  such  entity's  indebtedness  or
     obligations to any Person.

SECTION 1.6 RELEASES OF NOMURA PROPERTIES. Borrower shall not permit or give its
consent or approval to any Capital Transaction  (excluding a Capital Transaction
consisting  of an event  giving rise to an  insurance  recovery or  condemnation
award in  excess of  repair/restoration  costs) or other  event,  including  any
defeasance of any or all of the Nomura Loan, which results in the release of any
of the Nomura Properties from the Lien of the Nomura Loan Documents,  unless all
of the following conditions are satisfied:

(1)  Borrower  provides Lender with reasonable prior written notice (the "NOMURA
     RELEASE NOTICE") of the proposed release.

(2)  Concurrently  with the  consummation of the release,  Borrower shall pay to
     Lender an amount (the "NOMURA Payment") determined as follows:

(1)  If the release  occurs during the first Loan Year, the Nomura Payment shall
     be the greater of (i) one hundred ten percent  (110%) of the Adjusted  Loan
     Basis of the subject  Nomura  Property,  and (ii) the minimum amount which,
     when applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, would result
     in a Cash On Cash Return of at least ten and one-half percent (10.5%) and a
     Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.20 to 1.0.

(2)  If the release occurs during the second Loan Year, the Nomura Payment shall
     be the greater of (i) one hundred ten percent  (110%) of the Adjusted  Loan
     Basis of the subject  Nomura  Property,  and (ii) the minimum amount which,
     when applied to the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, would result
     in a Cash On Cash  Return  of at  least  eleven  percent  (11%)  and a Debt
     Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.0.

(3)  If the release  occurs after the second Loan Year, the Nomura Payment shall
     be the greater of (i) one hundred ten percent  (110%) of the Adjusted  Loan
     Basis of the subject  Nomura  Property,  and (ii) the minimum amount which,
     when  applied  to the  outstanding  principal  balance  of the Loan  (after
     application  of the Nomura  Payment to the Loan balance)  would result in a
     Cash On Cash Return of at least eleven and one-half  percent  (11.5%) and a
     Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.30 to 1.0.

(4)  Notwithstanding  subparagraphs  (a), (b) and (c) above,  the Nomura Payment
     for the final Nomura Property to be released shall include,  in addition to
     the applicable amount set forth in subparagraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above, an
     amount equal to the difference  between (i) the aggregate  amount of Nomura
     Payments made with respect to all Nomura  Properties  (including the amount
     of such payment for the final Nomura  Property,  calculated  in  accordance
     with  subparagraph  (a), (b) or (c) above, as  applicable),  except for any
     Nomura Properties  excluded by the next sentence of this subparagraph,  and
     (ii) the aggregate amount of the Nomura Payments which would have been made
     with  respect to all Nomura  Properties  (except for any Nomura  Properties
     excluded by the next sentence of this  subparagraph)  if the  percentage in
     clause (i) of  subparagraphs  (a),  (b) and (c) above had been one  hundred
     twenty  percent  (120%)  instead  of  110%;  provided,  however,  that  the
     foregoing 120% amount shall be changed to 115% for any Nomura  Property if,
     at the time of (and  after  giving  effect to) the  release of such  Nomura
     Property, the Cash On Cash Return was at least twelve percent (12%) and the
     Debt  Service  Coverage  Ratio  was at  least  1.30 to 1.0.  The  foregoing
     calculation shall exclude (and no additional  amounts shall be due upon the
     release of the final Nomura Property with respect to) any Nomura  Property,
     other than the last  remaining  Nomura  Property,  released  as an Impaired
     Property,  a Default  Property  or a  Property  which is the  subject  of a
     Complete  Taking  and is  released  while an Event of  Default  exists  (in
     accordance with paragraph (4) below).

(5)  Notwithstanding  subparagraphs  (a),  (b) and (c)  above,  but  subject  to
     subparagraph  (d), if the release  involves a Nomura  Property  which is an
     Impaired Property or a Default  Property,  then the Nomura Payment shall be
     equal to the Adjusted Loan Basis of such Property (plus, if the Property is
     the last remaining Nomura Property to be released,  such additional amount,
     if any, as is payable pursuant to subparagraph (d) above).

(6)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing (including subparagraph (d) above), in
     no event shall the Nomura Payment for any Nomura  Property  exceed the then
     outstanding Obligations.

(3)  No such release shall be permitted if, after giving effect to such release,
     the outstanding  balance of the Loan is less than $100,000,000 and the Cash
     On Cash Return is less than twelve percent (12%);  provided,  however, that
     if Borrower fails to satisfy the foregoing  Cash On Cash Return  condition,
     then  Borrower  may satisfy such  condition by paying down the  outstanding
     Loan  balance to an amount  which would  result in such Cash On Cash Return
     condition being satisfied.

(4)  Except as provided in this paragraph,  no Event of Default has occurred and
     is continuing on the date on which Borrower gives Lender the Nomura Release
     Notice and on the date the  release is closed;  provided,  however,  if the
     subject Nomura Property is a Default Property and the only Event of Default
     which  exists is the Event of Default  which  caused  such  Property  to be
     designated as a Default Property (and which arises from the occurrence of a
     breach,  default,  failure of  condition  or other  event for which no cure
     period is  provided),  then this  condition  shall be waived so long as the
     release  involving the Default  Property is  consummated  within 10 days of
     notice from Lender,  as required in the last  paragraph of Section 10.1. In
     addition,  Lender shall permit a transaction involving a Complete Taking of
     a Nomura Property  notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default, if
     and only if (a) Borrower has otherwise  satisfied the  conditions set forth
     in this Section 2.5 to the  consummation of the proposed  release,  and (b)
     Borrower pays to Lender, as the Nomura Payment for such Property, an amount
     equal to 100% of the Net Capital Proceeds from the Complete Taking plus (if
     such  Property is the last  remaining  Nomura  Property to be released) any
     additional  amount payable pursuant to subparagraph  (1)(d) above (it being
     understood by the parties that if no Event of Default exists, the amount to
     be paid by Borrower shall be the Nomura Payment as determined in accordance
     with paragraph (2) above).

(5)  Borrower  shall execute and deliver such other  instruments,  certificates,
     opinions of counsel and documentation as Lender shall reasonably request in
     order to  preserve,  confirm  or secure the Liens and  security  granted to
     Lender by the Loan Documents,  including any amendments,  modifications  or
     supplements to any of the Loan Documents.

(6)  Borrower  shall  pay for any and all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs  and
     expenses  incurred  by  Lender  in  connection  with any  proposed  release
     including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements.

(7)  Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender
     that all  amounts  owing to any  parties in  connection  with the  proposed
     release  have  been  paid in full,  or are  simultaneously  paid in full at
     closing,  or adequate  Reserves therefor are established by Borrower or the
     Nomura  Borrower in cash with respect to  contingent  or other  liabilities
     that may arise out of such transaction.

(8)  Unless the proposed  release will repay the Loan in full (and terminate all
     of Lender's  obligations  hereunder),  or the proposed  release involves an
     Impaired  Property or a Default  Property,  the release  shall consist of a
     sale or other  transfer of the Nomura  Property to a Person which is not an
     Affiliate of Borrower,  of the Nomura Borrower or of any Borrower Party. If
     the proposed release involves an Impaired  Property or a Default  Property,
     then  concurrently with the closing of the release Borrower shall cause the
     Nomura  Borrower to transfer the Property to an entity which may be related
     to the Nomura Borrower, so long as neither the Nomura Borrower nor Borrower
     is  directly  or  indirectly  liable  on a  recourse  basis for any of such
     entity's indebtedness or obligations to any Person.

SECTION 1.7 ADJUSTMENTS TO ADJUSTED LOAN BASIS. The Adjusted Loan Basis for each
Property shall be increased  dollar for dollar for Working Capital  Advances and
other Advances which relate  directly to such Property.  The Adjusted Loan Basis
for each  Property  shall be  decreased  dollar for dollar  for  prepayments  of
principal which relate directly to such Property (e.g., casualty or condemnation
proceeds, or a Release Payment or Nomura Payment) and any prepayment proceeds in
excess of the  Adjusted  Loan Basis  (e.g.,  the excess  portion of the  Release
Payment or Nomura Payment for any specific Property) and any other prepayment of
principal  not  directly  related to a specific  Property  shall be allocated by
Lender  among the  Properties,  on a pro rata  basis,  in  accordance  with each
Property's Adjusted Loan Basis.

SECTION 1.8 CAPITAL ADEQUACY; INCREASED COSTS; ILLEGALITY.

(1)  If Lender shall  determine  that any new  applicable  Law adopted after the
     Closing Date regarding  capital  adequacy,  or any change after the Closing
     Date in any  existing  Law,  or any change  after the  Closing  Date in the
     interpretation  or  administration  thereof by any Governmental  Authority,
     central  bank or  comparable  agency  charged  with the  interpretation  or
     administration thereof or compliance by Lender (or its lending office) with
     any request or directive  regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
     the  force  of law) of any such  Governmental  Authority,  central  bank or
     comparable  agency,  has or would have the effect of  reducing  the rate of
     return on Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or
     credit  extended by it  hereunder  to a level below that which Lender could
     have  achieved but for such  adoption,  change or  compliance  by an amount
     deemed  by  Lender  to be  material,  then  from  time to time as  promptly
     specified by Lender in writing,  Borrower shall pay such additional  amount
     or amounts as will  compensate  Lender for such  reduction;  provided  that
     Borrower  shall  not be  required  to pay  any  amounts  pursuant  to  this
     paragraph  (1) to a  subsequent  holder of the Note to the extent that such
     amounts would not have been payable had GECC continued to hold the Note.

(2)  Upon the  occurrence of any of the events set forth in paragraph (1) above,
     Lender shall promptly  notify Borrower in writing of the occurrence of such
     event. If requested by Borrower,  in connection with any demand for payment
     pursuant  to this  Section,  Lender  shall  provide  to  Borrower a summary
     setting  forth in reasonable  detail the basis for such demand,  the amount
     required  to be paid by  Borrower  to Lender and the  computations  made by
     Lender  to  determine  such  amount  (which  computations  shall be  deemed
     conclusive absent manifest error).

SECTION 1.9 APPLICATION OF NOMURA  PROVISIONS PRIOR TO FIRST ADVANCE FROM NOMURA
HOLDBACK.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
or the other Loan  Documents,  unless and until Lender makes an Advance from the
Nomura  Holdback,  (1) a breach  or  default  of any  representation,  warranty,
covenant or agreement in any Loan Document regarding the Nomura Loan, the Nomura
Properties,  the Nomura  Borrower  and/or the Nomura  Loan  Documents  shall not
constitute  a  Potential  Default or Event of Default,  and (2) for  purposes of
calculating Adjusted Annual Debt Service,  Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, Cash On
Cash Limit Amount,  Cash On Cash Return,  Debt Service  Coverage  Ratio and Debt
Service  Coverage  Ratio Limit Amount,  the parties  hereto shall  disregard (as
applicable for each  calculation) debt service on the Nomura Loan, the principal
balance of the Nomura Loan,  Gross  Receipts from the Nomura  Properties  and/or
Operating Expenses from Nomura Properties; provided, however, that it shall be a
condition  precedent to the first Advance from the Nomura  Holdback that (a) all
representations  and warranties  under the Loan  Documents  regarding the Nomura
Loan,  the Nomura  Properties,  the  Nomura  Borrower  and/or  the  Nomura  Loan
Documents be true and correct as of the date of such  Advance,  (b) no breach or
default  shall exist under any covenant or agreement  regarding the Nomura Loan,
the Nomura  Properties,  the Nomura  Borrower  and/or the Nomura Loan  Documents
contained  in the  Loan  Documents,  and  (c) in  determining  whether  Borrower
satisfies the  applicable  Cash On Cash Return and Debt Service  Coverage  Ratio
conditions  to such Advance  contained  in Section 1 of Part D of Schedule  2.1,
such  calculations  shall  account  for debt  service  on the Nomura  Loan,  the
principal  balance of the Nomura Loan, Gross Receipts from the Nomura Properties
and/or Operating  Expenses from Nomura  Properties.  For example (but not in any
way  limiting  the  foregoing),  prior to the  first  Advance  from  the  Nomura
Holdback,  any  calculation  of Debt Service  Coverage Ratio (not related to the
first Nomura Holdback  Advance) shall exclude Adjusted  Operating Cash Flow from
the Nomura  Properties  and the annual debt service on the Nomura Loan, but such
amounts  shall be  included  in  calculating  Debt  Service  Coverage  Ratio for
purposes of  determining  whether the Borrower  satisfies  the  applicable  Debt
Service  Coverage  Ratio  conditions in Part D of Schedule 2.1 for obtaining the
first Advance from the Nomura Holdback.

SECTION 1.10 GATEWAY TOWER  RESERVE.  On the Closing Date,  Lender shall fund to
itself (by book entry transfer) from the Initial Advance the sum of $150,000.00,
which shall be held by Lender in a reserve  (the  "GATEWAY  TOWER  RESERVE")  in
accordance  with this Section 2.9. The Gateway  Tower  Reserve  shall be held by
Lender,  with  interest  as provided  below,  and shall be released by Lender to
Borrower upon the first to occur of (1) release of the Gateway Tower Property in
accordance  with Section 2.4, (2) transfer of the Gateway Tower  Property by the
Gateway  Tower Owner to Borrower in accordance  with Section 2.10,  and (3) full
payment and performance of all Obligations  (and  termination of all obligations
of Lender under the Loan Documents). As additional security for the Obligations,
Borrower  hereby  grants  to  Lender a  security  interest  in all  funds now or
hereafter held in the Gateway Tower Reserve.  Upon any Event of Default,  Lender
may apply any funds held in the  Gateway  Tower  Reserve to the payment of or to
the  performance of any Obligation,  in any order.  All monies on deposit in the
Gateway Tower Reserve shall be deposited into interest  bearing  accounts of the
type  customarily  maintained  by  Lender  for the  investment  of  (and  may be
commingled  with)  similar  reserves,  which  accounts may not yield the highest
interest  rate then  available.  The Gateway  Tower  Reserve shall be held in an
account in Lender's  name (or such other  account name as Lender may elect) at a
financial  institution  or  other  depository  selected  by  Lender  in its sole
discretion (collectively, the "DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION").  Borrower shall earn no
more than an amount of interest on the Gateway  Tower Reserve equal to an amount
determined  by  applying  to the average  monthly  balance of the Gateway  Tower
Reserve the quoted interest rate for the Depository  Institution's  money market
savings  account,  as such rate is determined  from time to time (such allocated
amount being  referred to as  "BORROWER'S  Interest").  Lender or its Depository
Institution   shall  be  entitled  to  report  under   Borrower's   Federal  tax
identification  number the Borrower's  Interest on the Gateway Tower Reserve. If
the Depository  Institution  does not have an  established  money market savings
account (or if an interest rate for such account cannot  otherwise be determined
in  connection  with the deposit of the Gateway  Tower  Reserve),  a  comparable
interest rate quoted by the Depository  Institution  and acceptable to Lender in
its  reasonable  discretion  shall be used.  The amount of  Borrower's  Interest
allocated  to the Gateway  Tower  Reserve  shall be added to the balance in, and
shall become a part of, the Gateway Tower Reserve. Any interest earned above the
Borrower's  Interest  shall  be  retained  by  Lender  as  compensation  for its
administration and investment of the Gateway Tower Reserve.

SECTION 1.11 TRANSFER OF GATEWAY TOWER PROPERTY TO BORROWER.  At any time during
the Term,  Borrower  shall have the right to cause the Gateway Tower Property to
be  transferred  by the Gateway Tower Owner to Borrower in  accordance  with the
terms of this Section 2.10.  Upon completion of such transfer in accordance with
this Section 2.10,  the Gateway Pledge  Agreement  shall  terminate  (subject to
Section 15 thereof),  the Gateway  Tower Owner's  obligations  under the Gateway
Tower  Guaranty  shall  terminate  (subject to the second  sentence of Section 2
thereof),  and the obligation to maintain a minimum Indemnitors' Net Worth under
the Indemnification Agreement shall terminate. Any transfer of the Gateway Tower
Property to Borrower  shall be subject to  satisfaction  of all of the following
conditions  precedent  (any of which  may be  waived  by  Lender in its sole and
absolute discretion):

(1)  Borrower  shall have  provided  Lender  with at least five (5) days'  prior
     written  notice of its intent to cause the  transfer of the  Gateway  Tower
     Property to Borrower.

(2)  Such  written  notice  shall be  accompanied  by copies  of the  conveyance
     documents  for the proposed  transfer,  along with all other  documents (if
     any)  which  Borrower  intends  to  execute  (or cause to be  executed)  in
     connection with such transfer.

(3)  The Gateway  Tower Owner and Borrower  shall have executed and delivered to
     Lender such amendments to the Collateral Documents and other Loan Documents
     as Lender shall reasonably  request to reflect the proposed transfer of the
     Gateway  Tower  Property to  Borrower,  and  Borrower's  assumption  of the
     Gateway Tower Owner's obligations under the Loan Documents.

(4)  Lender shall have received such  endorsements to Lender's Title Policies as
     Lender shall reasonably require, including endorsements to the Title Policy
     insuring the Deed of Trust that  encumbers the Gateway Tower Property which
     insure  (a) that  Borrower  owns fee  simple  title  to the  Gateway  Tower
     Property  and (b) the  Deed of  Trust  that  encumbers  the  Gateway  Tower
     Property  continues  to  constitute  a  valid,  first-priority  Lien on the
     Gateway Tower Property, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances.

(5)  Lender shall have received  such  opinions of Borrowers  counsel , and such
     opinions of Lender's  local  counsel (if any),  as Lender shall  reasonably
     specify.

(6)  Borrower shall have delivered to Lender evidence that Borrower is qualified
     as a foreign  limited  liability  company in good  standing in the State of
     Maryland.

(7)  Borrower  shall  have  executed  and/or  delivered  to  Lender  such  other
     documents or items as Lender may reasonably require.

Borrower shall pay for any and all reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses
incurred  in  connection  with  any  proposed  transfer,   including  reasonable
attorneys'  fees and  disbursements  and all title  insurance  premiums  for any
endorsements  to any existing  Title Policies  reasonably  required by Lender in
connection with any such transfer.

                                    ARTICLE 3

                 INSURANCE, CONDEMNATION, DEPOSITS AND RESERVES

SECTION 1.12  INSURANCE.  Borrower shall  maintain,  and cause the Gateway Tower
Owner and the  Nomura  Borrower  to  maintain,  insurance  with  respect  to the
Properties as follows:

(1)  PROPERTY; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.  Borrower shall keep (or cause the Gateway
     Tower Owner to keep) the  buildings  and the  improvements  located on each
     Borrower  Property  insured (a) against loss or damage by fire,  lightning,
     windstorm,  tornado,  hail and such other further and additional hazards of
     whatever  kind or nature as are now or hereafter may be covered by standard
     extended coverage "all risk" endorsements  (including vandalism,  malicious
     mischief and damage by water (other than flood)) of whatsoever  kind, in an
     amount not less than one  hundred  percent  (100%) of the full  replacement
     cost  of such  improvements  including  the  cost of  debris  removal,  but
     excluding the value of foundations and excavation and surface parking,  (b)
     against loss or damage by earthquake,  including subsidence,  as reasonably
     required  by  Lender,   and  (c)  against  loss  of  rentals  and  business
     interruption due to any of the foregoing causes, in an amount not less than
     twelve  (12)  months  anticipated  gross  rental  income or gross  business
     earnings, as applicable.

(2)  LIABILITY.  Borrower  shall  maintain (or cause the Gateway  Tower Owner to
     maintain)  commercial  general  liability  insurance  with  respect to each
     Borrower Property and the operations related thereto,  whether conducted on
     or off such  Borrower  Property,  against  liability  for personal  injury,
     including  bodily  injury and death,  and property  damage in an amount not
     less than  $1,000,000  per  Borrower  Property and per  occurrence,  with a
     $4,000,000 per property umbrella policy.  Such liability insurance shall be
     on an occurrence basis, shall provide (but need not specifically  describe)
     coverage for sprinkler  leakage liability and water damage legal liability,
     and shall specifically include premises operations, products liability, and
     broad form contractual coverage. Borrower also shall maintain (or cause the
     Gateway Tower Owner to maintain) motor vehicle  liability for all owned and
     non-owned vehicles, including rented and leased vehicles.

(3)  WORKERS' COMPENSATION.  Workers' compensation for employees of Borrower and
     the Gateway Tower Owner as required by applicable Law.

(4)  FORM AND QUALITY.  All property and business  interruption or rental income
     insurance   provided   hereunder   shall  name  Lender   under  a  standard
     "non-contributory  mortgagee" endorsement or its equivalent, which shall be
     acceptable  to  Lender,  and  liability  insurance  shall be  evidenced  by
     certificates of insurance  issued to Lender and naming Lender as additional
     insured. All property insurance shall provide for loss payable to Lender as
     provided in this Agreement,  shall be provided by insurance companies which
     have a Best's rating of at least "A-IX" or otherwise shall be acceptable to
     Lender  in its  reasonable  discretion.  Every  policy of  insurance  shall
     contain an  agreement  by the  insurer  that it will not cancel such policy
     except after thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lender, if obtainable
     (but in no  event  less  than  ten (10)  days)  and  that any loss  payable
     thereunder  shall  be  payable  notwithstanding  any act or  negligence  of
     Lender,  Borrower  and/or the Gateway Tower Owner which might,  absent such
     agreement,  result  in a  forfeiture  of all or a part  of  such  insurance
     payment and  notwithstanding  (a) occupancy or use of the Borrower Property
     for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of such policy, (b)
     any  foreclosure or other action or proceeding  taken by Lender pursuant to
     the Deed of Trust  encumbering  the Borrower  Property or (c) any change in
     title to or ownership  of the Borrower  Property.  All  deductible  amounts
     under the  insurance  policies  required  to be  carried  pursuant  to this
     Section 3.1 shall be subject to Lender's reasonable  approval.  At Lender's
     request,  Borrower  shall  deliver to Lender  copies of, or (at  Borrower's
     option)  certificates of insurance for, all such policies of insurance.  If
     any insurance required to be provided hereunder shall expire, be withdrawn,
     become void by breach of any  condition  thereof by Borrower or the Gateway
     Tower  Owner  with  respect to any  Borrower  Property,  or become  void or
     questionable  by reason of the failure or  impairment of the capital of any
     insurer,  Borrower  immediately  shall obtain new or  additional  insurance
     which shall conform to the requirements hereof. Borrower shall not take out
     any separate or additional  insurance which is contributing in the event of
     loss unless it is properly endorsed and otherwise satisfactory to Lender in
     all  respects.  Lender shall have the right to conduct a periodic  audit of
     Borrower's  procedures in respect of insurance  matters and Borrower  shall
     cooperate with Lender therein.

(5)  INSURANCE ON NOMURA PROPERTIES. Borrower shall cause the Nomura Borrower to
     maintain  insurance  on and with respect to the Nomura  Properties  in such
     amounts and against such  insurable  events or  occurrences as are required
     under the Nomura Loan Documents, including Section 7.1.1 of the Nomura Loan
     Agreement.  Borrower shall  promptly  notify Lender if the Nomura Lender at
     any time  agrees to waive or diminish  in any  material  respect any of the
     insurance requirements set forth in the Nomura Loan Documents,  and in such
     event,  if required by Lender,  Borrower shall cause the Nomura Borrower to
     nevertheless  obtain all insurance  required  under the terms of the Nomura
     Loan  Documents  (without  regard  to any such  waiver or  agreement),  and
     Borrower shall promptly provide Lender with evidence thereof.

(6)  EVIDENCE OF INSURANCE. Borrower shall (a) pay, or cause the Nomura Borrower
     or the Gateway  Tower Owner to pay, as they become due all premiums for the
     insurance  required  hereunder,  and (b) not later than thirty (30) days if
     available (but in no event less than ten (10) days) prior to the expiration
     of each such policy,  deliver a  certificate  of insurance  evidencing  the
     insurance required to be provided hereunder  (including with respect to the
     Nomura  Properties) for a period of not less than one year, marked "premium
     paid,"  or  accompanied  by such  other  evidence  of  payment  as shall be
     reasonably satisfactory to Lender.

(7)  LENDER'S RIGHT TO PLACE  INSURANCE.  If Borrower shall be in default of its
     obligation to insure any Property in accordance with the provisions hereof,
     Lender, at its option and without notice, may (but shall have no obligation
     to)  obtain  such  insurance  from  year to year,  and pay the  premium  or
     premiums therefor, and, in such event, the amount of all such premiums paid
     by Lender  (a) shall be deemed to be  Obligations,  (b) shall be secured by
     the  Collateral  prior to any right or title to, or  interest  in, or claim
     upon, the Collateral  subordinate to the Lien of Lender on the  Collateral,
     and (c) shall be  immediately  due and payable,  on demand,  together  with
     interest  thereon at the Default Rate, from the date of any such payment by
     Lender to the date of repayment to Lender.

(8)  INCREASES  IN  INSURANCE  AMOUNTS.  Borrower  shall  increase the amount of
     all-risk  property  insurance  required  to be  provided  pursuant  to  the
     provisions  of  Section  3.1  hereof at the time  that each such  policy of
     insurance is renewed  (but,  in any event,  not less  frequently  than once
     during  each  twelve (12) month  period) by using the F.W.  Dodge  Building
     Index  (or,  if such  index is no  longer  available,  such  other  similar
     available index acceptable to Lender) to determine whether there shall have
     been an increase in the replacement cost of the improvement  since the most
     recent adjustment to any such policy and, if there shall have been any such
     increase,  the amount of insurance  required to be provided hereunder shall
     be adjusted accordingly.

(9)  COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY  REQUIREMENTS.  Borrower promptly shall comply,  and
     cause the Gateway Tower Owner and the Nomura  Borrower to comply,  with (a)
     all  of  the  provisions  of  each  such  insurance  policy  affecting  the
     Properties,  and (b) all of the  requirements  of the  insurers  thereunder
     applicable to Borrower, the Gateway Tower Owner and the Nomura Borrower (as
     applicable) or to any improvements located on the Properties or to the use,
     manner of use, occupancy, possession, operation,  maintenance,  alteration,
     repair or restoration of any of the improvements located on the Properties,
     even  if  such  compliance   would   necessitate   structural   changes  or
     improvements or would result in  interference  with the use or enjoyment of
     the Properties or any portion thereof.

(10) ADDITIONAL  INSURANCE.  Lender  shall  have the right  from time to time to
     require  Borrower  to procure  such  other and  additional  insurance,  and
     increased  amounts,  relating to the Properties in such amounts and against
     such insurable  events or occurrences as Lender may reasonably  require and
     which are  consistent  with  industry  practice  for assets  similar to the
     Properties,  including  (a) if  the  Property  is  located  in a  federally
     designated "special flood hazard zone", flood, including surface water; and
     (b) contingent liability from the operation of any building Laws pertaining
     to non-conforming property.

SECTION 1.13 CASUALTY;  USE AND APPLICATION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.  In the event
of damage or  destruction  to any  Property,  or any  portion  thereof,  whether
insured or uninsured, Borrower and Lender shall proceed as follows:

(1)  As to any Borrower Property, Borrower promptly shall give written notice of
     such damage or destruction to Lender (and upon such notification,  Schedule
     6.5 hereof  shall be deemed to have been  automatically  amended to reflect
     the matters  contained in such  notification)  and promptly shall cause the
     Property to be secured in a safe manner (including  spending necessary sums
     to address any immediate threats to life, health and safety)and  thereafter
     to prepare and submit a budget, and after approval thereof,  shall commence
     and diligently  continue to perform  repair,  restoration and rebuilding of
     the portion of the Property so damaged or destroyed (the "Work") to restore
     the Property in full  compliance  with all legal  requirements  so that the
     Property  shall be at least equal in value and quality and general  utility
     as it was prior to the damage or  destruction  and, if the cost of the Work
     as estimated by Lender  shall  exceed the sum of $250,000  ("MAJOR  WORK"),
     then  Borrower,  prior to the  commencement  of the Work,  shall furnish to
     Lender (a) complete plans and  specifications for the Work (approved by all
     Governmental  Authorities  whose  approval is  required at such time),  for
     Lender's  approval,  which approval shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or
     delayed,  which  plans and  specifications  (as  approved  by  Lender,  the
     "APPROVED  PLANS") shall bear the signed approval  thereof by the Architect
     and shall be accompanied by the Architect's  signed  estimate,  bearing the
     Architect's  seal, of the entire cost of completing the Work; (b) certified
     or  photostatic  copies of all  permits  and  approvals  required by Law in
     connection with the commencement and conduct of the Work; and (c) a payment
     and performance  bond for and/or guaranty of the payment for and completion
     of,  the  Work,  which  bond  or  guaranty  shall  be  in  form  reasonably
     satisfactory  to  Lender,  shall be  signed  by a surety  or  sureties,  or
     guarantor or guarantors,  as the case may be, who are reasonably acceptable
     to  Lender,  and shall be in an amount  of not less  than one  hundred  ten
     percent (110%) of the Architect's estimate of the entire cost of completing
     the Work.

(2)  Borrower  shall not commence any Work until  Borrower  shall have  complied
     with the  requirements  referred  to in  paragraph  (1)  above,  and  after
     commencing the Work,  Borrower shall perform the Work  diligently in a good
     and  workmanlike  manner and in good faith in accordance  with the Approved
     Plans, if applicable, and in compliance with all applicable Laws.

(3)  The property  insurance policies required to be maintained for the Borrower
     Properties  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement  shall  provide  that the
     proceeds shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
     If the  proceeds  exceed Two Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000),
     Borrower  promptly  shall  deliver  to Lender any  proceeds  which are paid
     directly  to Borrower  by the  property  insurance  carrier.  All  proceeds
     delivered to Lender as aforesaid,  together with all proceeds paid directly
     to Lender on account of damage or  destruction  to the  Property,  less the
     cost,  if any, to Lender of such  recovery and of paying out such  proceeds
     (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees and other third party out-of-pocket
     costs  allocable  to  inspecting  the  Work and  reviewing  the  plans  and
     specifications  therefor),  upon  written  request  of  Borrower,  shall be
     applied by Lender to the  payment of the cost of the Work and shall be paid
     out  from  time to time as the  Work  progresses  to  Borrower  and/or,  at
     Lender's option exercisable from time to time,  directly to the contractor,
     subcontractors,  materialmen,  laborers,  engineers,  architects  and other
     persons rendering services or materials in connection with the Work, except
     as otherwise hereinafter provided, but subject to the following conditions,
     any of which Lender may waive:

(1)  If the Work to be done is Major Work, as  reasonably  determined by Lender,
     the Architect shall administer the Work.

(2)  Each request for payment  shall be made at least ten (10) days prior to the
     requested date of disbursement and shall be accompanied by a certificate of
     an officer of WP Commercial  (as the manager of the sole member of the sole
     member of  Borrower)  stating that (i) all of the Work  completed  has been
     done in a good and workmanlike  manner and in material  compliance with the
     Approved  Plans (if  applicable),  and in  accordance  with all  applicable
     provisions of Law;  (ii) the sum requested is justly  required to reimburse
     Borrower for payments by Borrower to, or is justly due to, the  contractor,
     subcontractors,  materialmen,  laborers,  engineers,  architects  or  other
     persons  rendering  services or supplying  materials in connection with the
     Work (giving a brief description of such services and materials),  and that
     when added to all sums previously paid out by Lender, if any, the resulting
     sum  does  not  exceed  the  value  of the  Work  done to the  date of such
     certificate;  and (iii) the amount of  proceeds  remaining  in the hands of
     Lender,  together with other funds otherwise available to Borrower, will be
     sufficient on completion of the Work to pay for the same in full (giving in
     such  reasonable  detail as Lender may  require an  estimate of the cost of
     such completion and, if such other funds are required, as to the sources of
     such  funds).  If the Work is  structural  or  Major  Work,  as  reasonably
     determined by Lender,  then each request for payment therefor also shall be
     accompanied  by a certificate of the Architect  confirming,  in Architect's
     professional  opinion,  the  matters  listed in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
     preceding sentence.

(3)  Each  request  shall be  accompanied  by  waivers  or  releases  of  liens,
     reasonably   satisfactory  to  Lender,  covering  that  part  of  the  Work
     previously paid for, if any, and by a search prepared by a title company or
     other evidence  satisfactory  to Lender showing that any mechanic's lien or
     other lien or instrument  for the  retention of title  relative to the Work
     which has been filed  with  respect to the  Property  or any part  thereof,
     other than Permitted Encumbrances and those which may have been approved by
     Lender, have been discharged of record by bonding or otherwise.

(4)  None of the Material  Leases in effect  immediately  prior to the damage or
     destruction (i) shall have been canceled due to such damage or destruction,
     or (ii) shall  contain  any still  exercisable  right to cancel due to such
     damage or  destruction;  provided  that if such right to cancel  exists but
     cannot be exercised by the Tenant  under a Material  Lease unless  Borrower
     fails to complete the Work within a time period  specified in such Material
     Lease, then Lender also shall have reasonably  determined that the Borrower
     will not be able to complete  the Work  within the time  period  prescribed
     under such Material Lease.

(5)  There  shall be no Event of  Default  on the part of  Borrower  under  this
     Agreement or any other Loan Documents.

(6)  With respect to the final  advance only (which shall  include any retainage
     previously  held back by Lender) the request for any payment after the Work
     has been completed  shall be  accompanied  by a copy of any  certificate or
     certificates  required  by Law to render  occupancy  and  operation  of the
     Property legal.

(4)  Upon  completion of the Work and payment in full therefor,  or upon failure
     on the part of Borrower  promptly to commence or diligently to continue the
     Work,  or at any time upon request by Borrower,  the amount of any proceeds
     then or thereafter in the hands of Lender shall be applied by Lender to the
     Loan balance.

(5)  In the event the Work to be done is not Major Work,  the proceeds  shall be
     paid to Borrower to be applied toward the cost of the Work,  subject to the
     provisions of the foregoing  paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) above,  other
     than those applicable to Major Work.

(6)  If:  (a) within  ninety  (90) days  after the  occurrence  of any damage or
     destruction to a Borrower  Property or any portion thereof  requiring Major
     Work in order to restore the Property,  Borrower  fails to submit to Lender
     for Lender's approval plans and specifications for the repair,  restoration
     and  rebuilding  of the Property so damaged or  destroyed  (approved by the
     Architect and by all Governmental Authorities whose approval is required at
     such  time);   or  (b)  within  ninety  (90)  days  after  such  plans  and
     specifications  are approved by all such  Governmental  Authorities,  other
     parties  and  Lender,  Borrower  fails to promptly  commence  such  repair,
     restoration and rebuilding;  or (c) thereafter Borrower fails to diligently
     continue such repair,  restoration  and  rebuilding or is more than 30 days
     delinquent in the payment to mechanics,  materialmen or others of the costs
     incurred in  connection  with such Work (other than as a result of Lender's
     improper failure to release the insurance  proceeds for such Work and other
     than payment delays associated with amounts which Borrower is contesting in
     good faith to the extent and in the manner  expressly  permitted under this
     Agreement); or (d) in the case of any damage or destruction to the Property
     or any part  thereof  not  requiring  Major  Work in order to  restore  the
     Property,  as determined by Lender,  if Borrower fails to promptly  repair,
     restore and rebuild the Property so damaged or destroyed, or if Borrower in
     any other respect fails to comply with its  restoration  obligations  under
     this Section 3.2,  then,  in addition to all other rights herein set forth,
     and  after  giving   Borrower  ten  (10)  days'   written   notice  of  the
     nonfulfillment of one or more of the foregoing  conditions,  Lender may, at
     its option,  perform or cause to be performed such repair,  restoration and
     rebuilding,  and may take such other steps as it deems advisable to perform
     such Work; provided,  however,  that Lender shall be permitted to give such
     shorter  notice (and in such manner) as is reasonably  practical in case of
     emergency circumstances.  Lender may apply all or a portion of the proceeds
     (without the need to fulfill any other requirements of this Section 3.2) to
     reimburse  Lender for all amounts  expended or incurred by it in connection
     with the  performance  of such work,  and any excess costs shall be paid by
     Borrower to Lender upon demand.

(7)  As to any Nomura  Property,  Borrower  shall  cause the Nomura  Borrower to
     comply with the provisions of the Nomura Loan Documents governing damage or
     destruction  to the Nomura  Properties  and the  application  of  insurance
     proceeds  with respect  thereto.  Upon  completion  of any Work at a Nomura
     Property,  and payment in full therefore,  any remaining insurance proceeds
     which the  Nomura  Lender  does not  require be used to pay down the Nomura
     Loan shall be  delivered  promptly to Lender and shall be applied by Lender
     to the Loan balance.

SECTION 1.14      CONDEMNATION.

(1)  Borrower, immediately upon obtaining actual knowledge of the institution of
     any  proceedings  for  the  condemnation  of any  Property  or any  portion
     thereof,  shall notify Lender of the pendency of such proceedings (and upon
     such   notification,   Schedule   6.4  hereof   shall  be  deemed  to  have
     automatically  been  modified  to reflect  the  matters  contained  in such
     notification).   Lender,  at  its  election  and  in  its  discretion,  may
     participate  in any such  proceedings  affecting  a Borrower  Property  and
     Borrower,  from  time to time,  shall  deliver  to Lender  all  instruments
     requested  by Lender to permit  such  participation.  All awards  which are
     payable to Borrower from a  condemnation  or other  taking,  or purchase in
     lieu thereof,  of any Borrower  Property or any portion  thereof,  shall be
     paid and applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3. All
     such awards are hereby  assigned to and shall be paid to Lender.  Borrower,
     upon  request  by Lender,  shall  make,  execute  and  deliver  any and all
     instruments  requested for the purposes of confirming the assignment of the
     aforesaid  awards and  compensation  to Lender free and clear of any Liens.
     Borrower hereby  authorizes  Lender to collect and receive such awards,  to
     give proper  receipts and  acquittances  therefor and, to apply the same in
     the manner set forth in this Agreement.

(2)  In the event that a portion of any Borrower  Property is taken or condemned
     so that there is less than a Complete Taking,  then Borrower promptly shall
     commence and diligently continue to repair, restore, replace or rebuild the
     Property in accordance  with the  provisions  of Section 3.2 hereof,  as if
     such taking or condemnation had resulted in a casualty to the Property, and
     the proceeds of any award paid to Lender in connection therewith,  shall be
     made available to Borrower for such purposes;  provided,  however,  that in
     such event Borrower shall comply with, and such proceeds shall be disbursed
     to Borrower in accordance  with, the  provisions of Section 3.2 hereof.  In
     the event of a Complete Taking, all Net Capital Proceeds therefrom shall be
     applied in accordance with the release provisions in Section 2.4.

(3)  Notwithstanding  any taking by eminent  domain,  alteration of the grade of
     any street or other  injury to or decrease in value of any  Property by any
     Governmental  Authority,  Borrower  shall continue to make all payments due
     hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

(4)  In the event of any condemnation or eminent domain  proceeding  affecting a
     Nomura  Property,  the  Borrower  shall cause the Nomura  Borrower to fully
     comply with the  provisions  of the Nomura Loan  Documents  governing  such
     proceedings.  In the event of a Complete Taking of a Nomura  Property,  all
     Net Capital  Proceeds  therefrom  shall be applied in  accordance  with the
     provisions of Section 2.5.

SECTION 1.15      DEPOSITS.

(1)  CHARGES. Borrower shall segregate in a separate account held by Borrower in
     a  depository  acceptable  to Lender (the  "CHARGES  ACCOUNT")  and deposit
     therein  on or before  the  twenty-fifth  (25th) day of each month from and
     after the Closing  Date until the  Obligations  have been paid in full,  an
     amount equal to  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of the annual  Charges in respect of
     all Borrower  Properties.  Such  deposits  shall be used by Borrower to pay
     such Charges prior to  delinquency or any earlier date that any interest or
     penalty can be imposed thereon. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall deposit
     into the Charges Account an amount which when added to the monthly deposits
     required to be made  thereafter  pursuant to this Section is  sufficient to
     pay the next  installment of such Charges.  From time to time, on demand by
     Lender,  Borrower  shall  pay  into the  Charges  Account  additional  sums
     sufficient to permit payment of the next due  installments of such Charges,
     if,  and to the extent  that,  the  required  monthly  deposits  thereafter
     falling  due  before  the  respective  payment  dates  would  otherwise  be
     insufficient to permit the full payment thereof.

(2)  GENERAL  REQUIREMENTS  FOR FUNDS IN  SEGREGATED  ACCOUNTS.  Borrower  shall
     irrevocably  instruct  and shall  cause all  depositories  maintaining  any
     segregated  accounts required under the terms of this Agreement  (including
     the Charges Account,  the Security Deposits and Lease Buy Out Consideration
     accounts  and accounts in respect of any Impaired  Properties)  to,  within
     five (5) days after demand from Lender, deposit all funds deposited in such
     segregated   accounts  maintained  by  Borrower  into  segregated  accounts
     maintained by Lender.  Thereafter,  Borrower shall cause all deposits which
     Borrower  otherwise  would  have  been  required  to make  into  Borrower's
     segregated  accounts to be deposited in such accounts maintained by Lender.
     Contemporaneously  with the delivery of such  deposits to Lender,  Borrower
     shall  deliver  to Lender any  Security  Deposit in the form of a letter of
     credit  (including  any Tenant Deposit  Letters of Credit),  certificate of
     deposit  or  similar  non-cash  form of credit  enhancement  which  exceeds
     $50,000. Upon any Event of Default, Lender may apply any funds deposited in
     the accounts  maintained  by Lender or Borrower to the payment of or to the
     performance of any Obligation, except for any Security Deposit which, under
     the terms of the Lease to which it relates or pursuant to applicable  state
     Law, must be maintained in a segregated account. Borrower hereby designates
     Lender  as its  attorney-in-fact,  which  designation  is  irrevocable  and
     coupled with an interest, to draw upon the accounts of Borrower in the name
     of Borrower and to apply the funds  therein as provided in the  immediately
     preceding sentence.  As additional  security for the Obligations,  Borrower
     hereby pledges and assigns to Lender, and grants to Lender a first priority
     security  interest  in,  all  Charges  Accounts  and all  other  segregated
     accounts required under this Agreement  (including the accounts  maintained
     by Lender to the extent Borrower has any interest  therein),  and all funds
     at any time on deposit  therein,  and any and all Security  Deposits in the
     form of a letter of credit,  certificate  of  deposit  or  similar  form of
     non-cash credit enhancement.  Prior to the Closing Date,  Borrower,  Lender
     and the  depository  at which any such  account is held shall have  entered
     into a deposit account  agreement  substantially in the form of Exhibit "B"
     hereto (provided that if, based upon the jurisdiction in which such account
     is located,  Lender  determines  that an  agreement  of  different  form or
     substance is necessary or appropriate to perfect Lender's security interest
     in such account, then such deposit account agreement shall be of such other
     form  and  substance  as  Lender  determines  is  reasonably  necessary  or
     appropriate  for such  jurisdiction).  Borrower  shall  deliver  to  Lender
     monthly  reports of (a) all balances  and activity  with respect to each of
     the segregated  accounts  required by the terms of this Agreement,  (b) all
     Tenant  Deposit  Letters of Credit then held by Borrower and any draws made
     by Borrower thereon, and (c) any other information  reasonably requested by
     Lender.

     the indoor or outdoor  environment  or into or out of any property owned by
     such Person,  including the movement of Hazardous Materials in violation of
     Environmental Law through or in the air, soil, surface water,  ground water
     or property,  any disposal,  any discharge,  spillage,  uncontrolled  loss,
     seepage  or  filtration   of  any  Hazardous   Materials  in  violation  of
     Environmental Law.

(5)  "REMEDIAL  ACTION" means all actions required by  Environmental  Law to (a)
     clean up, remove,  treat or in any other way address Hazardous Materials in
     the indoor or outdoor  environment,  (b)  prevent  the Release or threat of
     Release or minimize the further  Release of Hazardous  Materials so they do
     not migrate or endanger or threaten to endanger public health or welfare or
     the indoor or outdoor environment,  or (c) perform pre-remedial studies and
     investigations and post-remedial monitoring and care.

SECTION 1.17 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS. As of the
Closing Date,  except as disclosed in the reports listed on Schedule 4.2 hereof,
to Borrower's knowledge,  (1) no Hazardous Material is now or was formerly used,
stored, generated, manufactured,  installed, disposed of or otherwise present at
or about any  Property or any  property  adjacent to such  Property  (except for
cleaning  and other  products  currently  used in  connection  with the  routine
maintenance  or repair of any  Property in full  compliance  with  Environmental
Laws),   (2)  all  permits,   licenses,   approvals  and  filings   required  by
Environmental  Laws have been obtained,  and the use, operation and condition of
the Property does not, and did not previously,  violate any Environmental  Laws,
and (3) no civil,  criminal or  administrative  action,  suit,  claim,  hearing,
investigation  or proceeding has been brought or been  threatened,  nor have any
settlements  been  reached  by or with  any  parties  or any  liens  imposed  in
connection with any Property  concerning  Hazardous  Materials or  Environmental
Laws,  nor  have  any  written  notices   concerning   Hazardous   Materials  or
Environmental  Laws been received from any Person in connection  with any assets
or activities of Borrower, the Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower or any
Property.  Borrower further  represents and warrants that (a) neither  Borrower,
the Nomura  Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner nor, to its knowledge,  any other
party has  been,  is or will be  involved  in  operations  at or near any of the
Properties  which  operations  could lead to (i) the  imposition of liability on
Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower,  or on any subsequent
or former owner of any of the  Properties  or (ii) the creation of a lien on any
of the  Properties  under the  Environmental  Laws or under any similar  laws or
regulations,  and (b) Borrower  will not permit,  and will not allow the Gateway
Tower Owner or Nomura  Borrower to permit,  any tenant or occupant of any of the
Properties  to engage in any  activity  that could  impose  liability  under the
Environmental  Laws on Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower
or any other owner of any of the Properties.

SECTION 1.18      COVENANTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

(1)  Borrower shall (a) comply, and cause the Gateway Tower Owner and the Nomura
     Borrower to comply,  strictly and in all respects with the  requirements of
     the Environmental Laws and shall notify Lender within 10 days of Borrower's
     obtaining  knowledge  in the event of (i) any  Release at,  upon,  under or
     within any of the Properties or (ii)  discovery of any Hazardous  Materials
     at,  upon,  under or within any of the  Properties  where  such  discovered
     Hazardous  Materials may result in Environmental  Liabilities and Costs and
     (b) forward  promptly to Lender  copies of all  orders,  notices,  permits,
     applications and other  communications  and reports  Borrower,  the Gateway
     Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower  receives in connection with any Release
     or the presence of any Hazardous Materials or any other matters relating to
     the Environmental Laws as all of the above may affect any of the Properties
     or any other properties  owned by Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner or the
     Nomura  Borrower.  Without  limiting the foregoing,  Borrower  specifically
     covenants and agrees to complete the Remedial Action described in paragraph
     2 of Schedule 8.19 hereof for the Properties.

(2)  To the extent that Lender reasonably believes that circumstances exist that
     require additional environmental testing to be performed on the Properties,
     promptly  upon the written  request of Lender  from time to time,  Borrower
     shall provide Lender,  at Borrower's  expense,  with an environmental  site
     assessment  or  environmental  audit  report  prepared by an  environmental
     engineering firm mutually acceptable to Lender and Borrower (and, as to any
     Nomura Property,  the Nomura Lender), to assess with a reasonable degree of
     certainty  the  presence  or absence  of any  Hazardous  Materials  and the
     potential  costs  in  connection  with  Remedial  Action  of any  Hazardous
     Materials found on, under, at or within any of the Properties.

(3)  Borrower and, subject to the provisions of the Joinder, WWPII and WWG shall
     at all times  indemnify and hold harmless  Lender  against and from any and
     all Environmental  Liabilities and Costs,  including reasonable  attorneys'
     fees, litigation costs and any costs of settlement, suffered or incurred by
     Lender, including those with respect to:

(1)  any  Release,  the threat of a Release,  or the  presence of any  Hazardous
     Materials  affecting  any of  the  Properties,  whether  or  not  the  same
     originates or emanates from any of the  Properties or any  contiguous  real
     property,  including any loss of value of any of the Properties as a result
     of any of the foregoing;

(2)  any costs of Remedial  Action  incurred by the United States  Government or
     any  costs  incurred  by any  other  Person  or  damages  from  injury  to,
     destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including reasonable costs of
     assessing  such  injury,  destruction  or  loss  incurred  pursuant  to any
     Environmental Laws; and/or

(3)  liability  for  personal  injury  or  property  damage  arising  under  any
     statutory or common law tort  theory,  including  damages  assessed for the
     maintenance  of a public or private  nuisance or for the  carrying on of an
     abnormally dangerous activity at or near any of the Properties.

The provisions of this Section 4.3 shall apply whether or not the  Environmental
Protection Agency, any other federal agency or any state or local  environmental
agency has taken or threatened any action in connection with the presence of any
Hazardous  Materials.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or anything  else to the
contrary  in the  Loan  Documents,  in no  event  shall  Borrower,  WWPII or WWG
indemnify  Lender  for any  Environmental  Liabilities  and Costs  caused by (i)
actions  taken solely and  negligently  by Lender,  its  successors  and assigns
(including  any  purchaser  at a  foreclosure  sale),  or (ii) the  presence  of
Hazardous  Materials on any Property  which is brought on a Property  during the
time that  Lender or its  successors  or assigns  (including  a  purchaser  at a
foreclosure sale) takes actual physical  possession and control of such Property
(except to the extent caused by Borrower).

(4)  In the event of any  Release,  the threat of a Release,  or the presence of
     any Hazardous Materials, where such may result in Environmental Liabilities
     and Costs,  affecting any Property,  whether or not the same  originates or
     emanates from any Property or any contiguous real property, or if Borrower,
     the Gateway  Tower Owner or the Nomura  Borrower  shall fail to comply with
     any of  the  requirements  of the  Environmental  Laws,  Lender  may at its
     election,  but without the  obligation  so to do, give such notices  and/or
     cause such work to be  performed  and/or take any and all other  actions as
     Lender shall  reasonably  deem  necessary  in order to abate such  Release,
     remove the Hazardous  Materials to the extent required by the Environmental
     Laws, cure Borrower's,  the Gateway Tower Owner's or the Nomura  Borrower's
     noncompliance  with  Environmental  Laws or take  such  steps  as it  deems
     necessary to remove any lien imposed by federal or state  authorities under
     Environmental Laws.

(5)  If  prior  to  the  Maturity  Date  Lender   reasonably   determines  after
     consultation  with Borrower (a) that  Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner or
     the Nomura  Borrower  faces a material risk of sustaining an  Environmental
     Liability  and Cost (other than the cost of any Remedial  Action in respect
     of any Property  that will  continue to be owned by Borrower) and (b) that,
     taking into account  Borrower's then existing assets and other liabilities,
     the outstanding Obligations, available insurance coverage, the availability
     of indemnification or contribution from other parties (such as prior owners
     or owners of nearby  properties)  and other  relevant  factors,  such as an
     orderly (not forced)  disposition  of the  Properties,  there is a material
     risk that Borrower may be unable to satisfy such  contingent  Environmental
     Liability and Cost if and when it becomes due and to pay and perform all of
     the  Obligations  when due in full, such that the members in Borrower might
     become  obligated in respect of the Loan on a recourse basis as provided in
     the  Joinder,  then by notice to Borrower,  Lender may require  Borrower to
     establish and fund to the extent of monies otherwise  available to Borrower
     for  distribution  to its  members,  a Reserve  in a  reasonable  amount to
     satisfy  such  material  risk and to maintain  such funded  Reserve in such
     amount  and until such time as Lender can  reasonably  determine  that such
     Reserve is no longer needed to satisfy the  requirements of clauses (a) and
     (b)  of  this  sentence.  In  such  event,  Borrower,  notwithstanding  the
     foregoing  provisions of this Section 4.3, shall be required,  after making
     payments otherwise required on the Loan (and causing the Nomura Borrower to
     make  payments  otherwise  required  on the  Nomura  Loan),  to  apply  any
     additional Operating Cash Flow or Net Capital Proceeds to fund such Reserve
     before making any  distributions to the members in Borrower.  Borrower may,
     not more often than once each  quarter,  require  Lender to confirm that it
     requires  continuation  of such  Reserve  and  Lender  shall  set forth its
     reasons for so  requiring.  Borrower  will  cooperate  with Lender and make
     available  to it such  information  as Lender may  reasonably  request  for
     purposes of making any such determination  regarding a Reserve,  and Lender
     shall in good faith  consider any relevant  information  in respect of such
     matter provided to it by Borrower or any of its members.

(6)  In the event of a dispute  between Lender and Borrower,  WWPII or WWG as to
     whether  Borrower  or the  Gateway  Tower  Owner  faces a material  risk of
     sustaining an  Environmental  Liability and Cost as set forth in clause (a)
     of paragraph  (5) above or the  estimated  dollar  amount of such  material
     risk,  then Borrower shall pick an appropriate  consultant and Lender shall
     pick an appropriate  consultant,  and the two consultants  shall confer and
     jointly determine whether or not Borrower, or the Gateway Tower Owner faces
     a material  risk and the  estimated  dollar amount of such material risk as
     more  fully set forth in clause  (a) of  paragraph  (5)  above.  If the two
     consultants  cannot agree within thirty (30) days after being  appointed as
     consultants  as to whether  such a material  risk  exists or the  estimated
     dollar amount of such material risk, the two consultants will, within seven
     (7) days after the  expiration  or such  thirty  (30) day  period,  jointly
     select a third consultant and within thirty (30) days of its selection, the
     third consultant shall issue its written determination as to whether such a
     material risk exists and the estimated dollar amount of such material risk,
     which determination shall be final and binding on all parties. In the event
     that the two  consultants  shall be unable to timely agree on the selection
     of a third  consultant,  the  third  consultant  shall be  selected  by the
     President  of the  American  Arbitration  Association.  In the  event  of a
     dispute  between  Lender  and  Borrower,  WWPII  or WWG in  respect  of the
     establishment  or continuation  of any such Reserve,  such Reserve shall be
     established or continued in the interim while such dispute is resolved.  No
     such  resolution  shall  constitute a  limitation  on or waiver of Lender's
     right to seek  recourse  (subject to the  provisions  of the Joinder)  from
     WWPII or WWG to the extent of distributions made to them by Borrower in the
     event Lender becomes liable in respect of any  Environmental  Liability and
     Cost of Borrower against which it is entitled to indemnity from Borrower or
     in the  event  the  Loan  is not  repaid  in  full by  reason  of  Borrower
     sustaining any such Environmental Liability and Cost.

SECTION  1.19 NO WAIVER.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  in this  Article 4 or
elsewhere in the Loan Documents,  or any rights or remedies  granted by the Loan
Documents,  Lender does not waive and expressly reserves all rights and benefits
now or hereafter  accruing to Lender under any  "security  interest" or "secured
creditor"  exceptions  under applicable  Environmental  Laws, as the same may be
amended.  No action  taken by Lender  pursuant  to the Loan  Documents  shall be
deemed or  construed  to be a waiver  or  relinquishment  of any such  rights or
benefits under the "security interest exception."

                                    ARTICLE 5

the foregoing representation and warranty is made to Borrower's knowledge),  and
the  Leases are valid and in and full  force and  effect;  (2) the Leases are in
writing,  and there are no oral agreements with respect thereto;  (3) the copies
of the Leases  delivered  to Lender  are true and  complete;  (4) to  Borrower's

in Schedule 5.1(B), Borrower has no knowledge,  after due inquiry, of any notice
of termination or default with respect to any Lease;  (6) with respect to Leases

Owner has  assigned  or pledged any of the  Leases,  the rents or any  interests
therein  except to  Lender;  (7) with  respect  to Leases of space at the Nomura
Properties,  the Nomura  Borrower has not assigned or pledged any of the Leases,
the rents or any interests  therein except to the Nomura  Lender;  (8) except as
set forth in Schedule 5.1(C), no Tenant or other party has an option to purchase
all or any portion of any Property;  (9) except as set forth in Schedule 5.1(D),
no Tenant has the right to terminate its Lease prior to expiration of the stated
term of such lease;  (10) except as set forth in Schedule  5.1(E),  there are no
leasing commissions that are owing in connection with any Leases or tenancies in

no tenant has  prepaid  more than one month's  rent in advance  (except for bona
fide security deposits not in excess of an amount equal to three month's rent).

SECTION 1.21 GENERAL LEASE  REQUIREMENTS.  Each Lease hereafter  entered into by
Borrower or the Gateway  Tower Owner shall (1) not permit the Tenant  thereunder
to  terminate  or  invalidate  the terms of the Lease as a result of any  action
taken by  Lender to  enforce  any  right or  remedy  under  the Loan  Documents,
including any sale of the Property or any portion thereof  pursuant to the power
of sale or otherwise,  (2) include a  subordination  clause  providing  that the
Lease and the  interest  of the Tenant  thereunder  in the  Property  are in all
respects subject and subordinate to the Loan Documents, (3) provide that, at the
option of Lender or the  purchaser  at a  foreclosure  sale or the  grantee in a
voluntary conveyance in lieu of such sale, the Tenant thereunder shall attorn to
Lender or to such  purchaser or grantee  under all of the terms of the Lease and
recognize  such entity as the lessor under the Lease for the balance of the term
of the Lease, and (4) provide that, in the event of the enforcement by Lender of
the rights and remedies  provided by law or in equity or by the Loan  Documents,
any Person  succeeding to the interest of Borrower or the Gateway Tower Owner as
a  result  of  such  enforcement  shall  not  be  bound  by  any  prepayment  of
installments  of rent for more than thirty (30) days in advance of the time when
the  same  shall  become  due  or  any   amendment,   modification,   extension,
cancellation  or renewal of the Lease made without the prior written  consent of
Lender.  Any Lease which is in a form  approved by Lender after the Closing Date
shall be deemed to comply with this  Section.  All Leases of space at the Nomura
Properties  shall  comply with the  leasing  requirements  contained  in Section
5.1(u)(i) of the Nomura Loan Agreement, and Borrower shall not permit the Nomura
Borrower  to seek a waiver  of any such  requirements  without  first  obtaining
Lender's consent to such waiver.

SECTION 1.22 COVENANTS.  Borrower shall deliver to Lender, promptly after demand
by Lender,  a rent roll for each Property in form and substance  satisfactory to
Lender.  Borrower shall promptly  deliver to Lender a fully executed copy of any
new Lease upon execution of the same, and shall promptly  deliver to Lender upon
Lender's  request a fully  executed  copy of all  other  Leases  not  previously
delivered to Lender.  Borrower  shall not, and Borrower  shall cause the Gateway
Tower Owner and the Nomura  Borrower  not to, (1) assign,  mortgage or otherwise
encumber  any of the Leases or any of the rents due or to become due  thereunder
or to which  Lender may now or  hereafter  become  entitled  (except,  as to the
Nomura  Properties,  Liens in favor of the Nomura Lender  pursuant to the Nomura
Loan Documents), or (2) accept prepayments of installments of rent for more than
thirty  (30) days in advance  of the time when the same  shall  become due or to
anticipate the rents thereunder, except for Security Deposits.


SECTION 1.23 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS REGARDING MATERIAL LEASES. All Leases covering
at least  20,000  rentable  square  feet,  and any  combination  of Leases which
collectively  cover at least  20,000  rentable  square feet of any  Property and
which are entered into with a single  Tenant or with Tenants who are  Affiliates
of each  other,  shall be  referred  to herein as  "MATERIAL  LEASES".  The term
"Material Leases" also shall include any Lease which covers 100% of the rentable
square feet at any Property,  and any  combination of Leases which  collectively
cover 100% of the  rentable  square feet of any  Property  and which are entered
into with a single Tenant or with Tenants who are  Affiliates of each other.  As
to any Material  Leases,  Borrower  shall, or shall cause the Nomura Borrower or
the Gateway Tower Owner to, (1) promptly perform all of the material  provisions
of the Material Leases on the part of the lessor thereunder to be performed; (2)
promptly  enforce all of the material  provisions of the Material  Leases on the
part of the Tenants  thereunder  to be performed;  (3) not cancel,  terminate or
accept a surrender  of any  Material  Lease,  or refrain  from taking any action
which  would  result  in the  termination  of a  Material  Lease  by any  Tenant
thereunder,  unless  the  Tenant  thereunder  is in  default  or such  action is
otherwise  commercially prudent and all Lease Buy Out Consideration,  if any, is
deposited  and used in the manner set forth  below in this  Article 5  (provided
that Borrower shall not be in breach of this clause (3) if a Tenant  exercises a
termination  right or option  expressly  provided for in such Tenant's  Material
Lease, and such right or option is not contingent or conditioned upon any act or
failure to act by Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower,  as
applicable);  (4) appear in and  prosecute  or defend  any action or  proceeding
arising  under,  growing out of, or in any manner  connected  with, the Material
Leases or the obligations of the lessor or the lessees  thereunder,  as the case
may be; (5) provide  Lender  with a copy of each  notice of default  received by
Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura  Borrower from the Tenant under
any Material Lease immediately upon receipt thereof and deliver to Lender a copy
of each  notice of default  sent by  Borrower,  the  Gateway  Tower Owner or the
Nomura  Borrower to a Tenant under any Material  Lease  simultaneously  with its
delivery of such notice  under such  Material  Lease;  and (6)  promptly  notify
Lender of all material disputes and claims in respect of any Material Leases and
not settle or adjust  any such  material  claims or  disputes  without  Lender's
consent.  In addition,  Borrower shall not, and Borrower shall cause the Gateway
Tower Owner and the Nomura  Borrower  not to, (a) consent to any  assignment  or
subletting of any Material  Lease if the assignor or sublessor  thereof would be
relieved from  liability  thereafter  accruing  under such Material  Lease;  (b)
discount any rents under any Material Lease or otherwise refrain from taking any
action with respect to a Material  Lease which would result in the diminution of
the rents  thereunder;  and (c)  without  Lender's  prior  consent,  enter into,
modify, amend, extend, renew, or otherwise change in any material manner, any of
the terms covenants or conditions of, any Material Lease.  Without  limiting the
foregoing,  Borrower shall not, and Borrower shall cause the Gateway Tower Owner
and the Nomura Borrower not to, enter into, extend or modify any new or existing
Material  Lease  affecting a Property for base  rentals  which are less than the
lesser of (i) the average  aggregate base rentals for all Leases  affecting such
Property,  and (ii) the fair market rental for similar space in other  buildings
similarly situated.

SECTION 1.24 LENDER'S  CONSENT TO  DEVIATIONS.  Borrower  shall obtain  Lender's
prior, written consent to any deviations from the leasing covenants set forth in
this Article 5 and (with  respect to the Nomura  Properties)  to any  deviations
from the leasing covenants set forth in the Nomura Loan Documents.  Lender shall
not unreasonably  withhold its consent to any such request,  except with respect
to requests to deviate from the minimum rent requirements for Material Leases as
set forth above,  in which event Lender may withhold its consent in its sole and
absolute  discretion.  If Lender  does not  respond to  Borrower's  request  for
consent to a deviation  from the leasing  covenants  set forth herein within ten
(10) days after  receipt of Borrower's  request,  Lender shall be deemed to have
consented to such request,  provided,  however, that with respect to any request
to deviate from the minimum  rent  requirements  for  Material  Leases set forth
above,  Lender's  failure to respond within such 10-day period shall be deemed a
rejection of such request.

SECTION  1.25  SECURITY  DEPOSITS;  LEASE BUY OUT  CONSIDERATION.  All  security
deposits paid or payable under any Lease covering space at a Borrower  Property,
including proceeds from any draw on a Tenant Deposit Letter of Credit ("SECURITY
DEPOSITS"),  and all  Lease  Buy  Out  Consideration  shall  be  maintained  and
administered by Borrower as follows:

(1)  Borrower shall maintain all Security  Deposits and separately  maintain all
     Lease Buy Out Consideration  paid by Tenants,  in separate accounts held by
     Borrower  in  a  depository   institution  acceptable  to  Lender.  Nothing
     contained  herein  shall be deemed to require  Borrower to deposit into any
     such account an amount equal to the Security Deposit required under a Lease
     if  either  Borrower  or a prior  landlord  under  such  Lease  waived  the
     obligation of Tenant under such Lease to pay such Security  Deposit (and as
     a result,  Borrower has no obligation to such Tenant for the return of such
     Security Deposit).  The segregated accounts for Security Deposits and Lease
     Buy Out  Consideration  required  by this  Section  shall be subject to the
     general  provisions of this Agreement  pertaining to any segregated account
     which Borrower is required to maintain in accordance with the terms of this
     Agreement.

(2)  Security  Deposit funds held in such account for any Lease shall be used to
     repay  the  Tenant  which  paid the  Security  Deposit  to  Borrower  or as
     otherwise provided in the applicable Lease. Forfeited Security Deposits and
     any other Security Deposits which Borrower is otherwise  entitled to retain
     due to a default by a Tenant under its Lease,  including  the draw proceeds
     from a Tenant  Deposit  Letter of Credit,  shall be used by Borrower to pay
     for Tenant Improvements, Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs incurred in
     connection  with  re-leasing  the space  vacated  by the  Tenant  under the
     defaulted  Lease (or in repairing any damage to the Property  caused by the
     Tenant  default),  and  Borrower  shall have  exhausted  all such  Security
     Deposit funds in payment of such costs and expenses before Borrower may use
     or request any Working  Capital  Advances  for such  vacated  space  (I.E.,
     Borrower  may only  request  Working  Capital  Advances  to pay for  eighty
     percent (80%) of the costs which exceed the amount of such Security Deposit
     funds). Any excess Security Deposit funds remaining after payment of Tenant
     Improvements, Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs incurred in connection
     with  re-leasing  the  space  vacated  by the  defaulting  Tenant  shall be
     retained in the segregated account to pay for Tenant Improvements,  Capital
     Expenditures  and Leasing  Costs  incurred in  connection  with other space
     within the  Property,  provided  that Borrower may use such excess funds to
     pay its 20% share of such costs,  in  conjunction  with  obtaining  Working
     Capital Advances therefor; provided further, however, that if (a) the space
     vacated by the  defaulting  Tenant has been  re-leased  at  then-prevailing
     market  rents  (and  otherwise  in  accordance  with the  terms of the Loan
     Agreement),  (b) the Debt Service  Coverage  Ratio is at least 1.20 to 1.0,
     and (c) no Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  then upon
     Borrower's  request Lender will consent to the release of such excess funds
     to Borrower.

(3)  Any Lease Buy Out  Consideration  received by Borrower or the Gateway Tower
     Owner or their agents with respect to space within a Property shall be used
     by Borrower or the Gateway Tower Owner to pay for any Tenant  Improvements,
     Capital  Expenditures,  Leasing Costs or marketing costs in connection with
     that Property.

(4)  Provided no Event of Default shall then be existing  under this  Agreement,
     if a Property in connection with which any Lease Buy Out  Consideration was
     paid or any Security  Deposits  are held will be released  from the lien of
     the applicable Deed of Trust in accordance with this Agreement, any amounts
     in the account  holding such Lease Buy Out  Consideration  and/or  Security
     Deposits  applicable to such Property shall be released,  concurrently with
     such release, to Borrower.

(5)  Borrower  shall  promptly  notify  Lender  of any draw on a Tenant  Deposit
     Letter of Credit,  and shall provide Lender with  reasonable  evidence that
     the proceeds from such draw have been deposited  into a segregated  account
     as  required  by this  Agreement.  The monthly  reports  which  Borrower is
     required  to  provide  Lender  in  connection  with the  Security  Deposits
     accounts and Lease Buy Out  Consideration  accounts shall  identify,  as to
     each such account,  the source Properties of the Security Deposits or Lease
     Buy Out Consideration  therein, and the amount of Security Deposit or Lease
     Buy  Out  Consideration  funds  in such  account  allocable  to  each  such
     Property.

(6)  If an Event of Default occurs and, as a result thereof,  Lender accelerates
     the Loan,  then upon  Lender's  demand  Borrower  shall deliver any and all
     original  Tenant  Deposit  Letters  of Credit to  Lender,  along  with such
     documentation  as is required by the issuing  banks to transfer  the Tenant
     Deposit  Letters of Credit  (including all draw rights and all other rights
     of the beneficiary thereunder) from Borrower to Lender or Lender's nominee.
     In addition, if a Draw Event occurs under a Tenant Deposit Letter of Credit
     after the Loan has been  accelerated  but before such Tenant Deposit Letter
     of Credit has been transferred to Lender or its nominee, then upon Lender's
     demand  Borrower  shall draw on such  Tenant  Deposit  Letter of Credit (in
     accordance  with the terms of the  applicable  Lease) and shall  direct the
     issuing  bank to wire  transfer  the  proceeds of such draw into an account
     designated  and  controlled  by Lender or its nominee.  Such draw  proceeds
     shall be governed by Section 3.4(2) of this Agreement.

(7)  Without  limiting  any  obligations  of  Borrower or the  Borrower  Parties
     hereunder,  any one of the following  acts shall be deemed to be, and shall
     constitute,  a  misappropriation  of  Security  Deposits  or other  amounts
     required to be held by Borrower in escrow or segregated  accounts  pursuant
     to the terms of the Loan  Agreement,  for which  Borrower  and the Borrower
     Parties  shall have  personal  liability  pursuant to clause (3) of Section
     12.1 and the Joinder:  (a)  Borrower's  failure to deposit  Tenant  Deposit
     Letter of Credit draw  proceeds  into a  segregated  account as required by
     paragraph (1) above,  (b) Borrower's  failure to use Security Deposit funds
     (including  Tenant  Deposit  Letter of Credit  draw  proceeds)  for  Tenant
     Improvements,  Capital  Expenditures  and  Leasing  Costs  as  required  by
     paragraph  (2)  above,  (c)  Borrower's  breach  of its  obligations  under
     paragraph (6) above.

Borrower shall cause the Nomura  Borrower to fully comply with the provisions of
the Nomura Loan  Documents  governing  the  maintenance  and  administration  of
Security  Deposits  and  Lease  Buyout  consideration  and,  to the  extent  not
addressed  by or  otherwise  in  conflict  with the Nomura Loan  Documents,  the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.6.

SECTION  1.26  SUBORDINATION  AGREEMENTS;  TENANT  ESTOPPELS.  Without  limiting
Borrower's  obligation to provide Lender with subordination,  nondisturbance and
attornment  agreements  as  required  by Lender as a  condition  to the  Initial
Advance and the Advance of the Shattuck Office Center Holdback,  upon request by
Lender, Borrower shall use reasonable good faith efforts to cause the Tenants at
the Borrower  Properties,  under Material Leases selected by Lender,  to execute
and deliver to Lender  subordination,  nondisturbance and attornment  agreements
with respect to such Tenant's Lease within  forty-five (45) calendar days of the
date of Lender's request (on a form provided by Lender to Borrower).  Borrower's
failure to obtain a subordination, nondisturbance and attornment agreement as to
any Material Lease within the aforementioned  45-day period shall not constitute
a Potential Default so long as Borrower has used reasonable,  good faith efforts
to obtain such  subordination,  nondisturbance  and attornment  agreement during
such period. In addition, from time to time at Lender's request,  Borrower shall
request,  and shall cause the Nomura Borrower to request,  from each Tenant (and
shall deliver to Lender upon receipt from such Tenant) a written estoppel in the
form  required by such Tenant's  Lease (or if no form is specified,  in form and
substance  satisfactory  to Lender)  confirming,  among other things,  the term,
rent,  and other  provisions  and  matters  relating  to such  Lease;  provided,
however,  that Borrower's  obligation with respect to such estoppel certificates
shall be limited to requesting  (or causing the Nomura  Borrower to request,  as
applicable) such estoppel  certificates from Tenants and (if accurate) informing
such Tenants of their Lease obligation to provide such estoppel certificates. No
Potential  Default  shall be caused by the  failure  of one or more  Tenants  to
provide an estoppel certificate after such request is made.

Capital  Advances or Holdback  Advances,  (2) a request from Borrower to release
any  Property  from the Lien of the Loan  Documents or to consent to a sale of a
Nomura Property,  or (3) an extension of the Term. If any audit performed by, or
on behalf of, Lender  discloses  that  Borrower's  statement of Gross  Receipts,
Operating  Expenses,  Operating  Cash  Flow,  Capital  Expenditures,  escrow  or
segregated accounts (for Security Deposits, Charges, Lease Buy Out Consideration
or Operating Cash Flow), Net Capital Proceeds or similar  financial  information
is misstated or is otherwise incorrect by greater than 5% of Borrower's reported
amount,  then  Borrower  shall pay to Lender  the full cost of  Lender's  audit.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  during any period that an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing,  Borrower shall be responsible for the full cost and
expense of any Lender investigation or audit conducted by Lender.

SECTION 1.58  COMMUNICATION  WITH ACCOUNTANTS.  Borrower  authorizes,  and shall
cause the Gateway Tower Owner and the Nomura  Borrower to  authorize,  Lender to
communicate  directly with Borrower's,  the Gateway Tower Owner's and the Nomura
Borrower's  independent  certified public accountants,  and Borrower authorizes,
and shall cause the Gateway  Tower Owner and the Nomura  Borrower to  authorize,
those  accountants  to disclose to Lender any and all financial  statements  and
other  supporting  financial  documents  and schedules  including  copies of any
management  letter with respect to the business,  financial  condition and other
affairs of Borrower, the Gateway Tower Owner and the Nomura Borrower.

                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

Borrower  covenants and agrees that,  unless Lender shall  otherwise  consent in
writing, from and after the Closing Date and until the Maturity Date:

SECTION 1.59  MAINTENANCE OF EXISTENCE AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.  Borrower shall,
and shall cause the Gateway  Tower Owner and the Nomura  Borrower  to, (1) do or
cause to be done all things  necessary  to  preserve  and keep in full force and
effect its existence as a limited  liability  company,  and,  unless the loss of
same shall not have a Material Adverse Effect, its rights, licenses,  privileges
and  franchises;  (2)  continue  to  conduct  its  business  only  as  permitted
hereunder;  (3) not make any  changes in its  business  objectives,  purposes or
operations  in any way  that  would  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect;  and (4)
transact business only in the name of Wellsford/Whitehall  Holdings,  L.L.C. (as
to Borrower),  WWG 401 North  Washington LLC (as to the Gateway Tower Owner) and
Wells Avenue Senior  Holdings,  L.L.C. (as to the Nomura  Borrower),  or in each
case such other  names as Borrower  shall  specify to Lender in writing not less
than thirty (30) days prior to the first date such name is used by Borrower, the
Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower.

SECTION 1.60 PAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS.


(1)  Borrower  shall,  using Gross Receipts from all of the Borrower  Properties
     and Operating Cash Flow (after debt service on the Nomura Loan) from all of
     the  Nomura  Properties,  (a) pay and  discharge  or  cause  to be paid and
     discharged  all  Obligations,  as and when due and payable  (subject to any
     notice  or  grace  periods  provided  in the Loan  Documents),  (b) pay and
     discharge or cause to be paid and  discharged (i) prior to the day that any
     interest  or penalty  can be imposed  thereon,  all  Charges  imposed  upon
     Borrower, its income and profits, or any of its property (real, personal or
     mixed), and (ii) lawful claims for labor, materials,  supplies and services
     used by or supplied to Borrower  before any thereof shall become in default
     (subject to any  applicable  notice or grace periods) and (c) to the extent
     not paid  from  Loan  proceeds,  pay all  Capital  Expenditures  and  other
     Indebtedness  related to any of the  Borrower  Properties  as and when such
     amounts come due.

(2)  Borrower may in good faith contest, by proper legal actions or proceedings,
     the validity or amount of any Charges or claims arising under clause (b) of
     paragraph (1) above,  provided that at the time of commencement of any such
     action or  proceeding,  and during  the  pendency  thereof  (a) no Event of
     Default shall be continuing; (b) adequate Reserves with respect thereto are
     maintained  on the books of Borrower,  in  accordance  with GAAP;  (c) such
     contest operates to suspend  collection of the contested  Charges or claims
     and is maintained and prosecuted  continuously with diligence;  (d) none of
     the Borrower  Properties would be subject to forfeiture or loss or any Lien
     by reason of the  institution or prosecution of such contest;  (e) Borrower
     shall promptly pay or discharge  such contested  Charges and all additional
     charges,  interest,  penalties and  expenses,  if any, and shall deliver to
     Lender  evidence  acceptable  to  Lender  of such  compliance,  payment  or
     discharge,  if such  contest is  terminated  or  discontinued  adversely to
     Borrower;  and (f) Lender has not advised  Borrower in writing  that Lender
     reasonably  believes that nonpayment or  nondischarge  thereof would have a
     Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall have
     the  right  to pay the  Charges  or  claims  arising  under  clause  (b) of
     paragraph  (1) above and in good faith  contest by proper  legal  action or
     proceedings, the validity or amount of such Charges or claims.

(3)  If Borrower shall be in default of its obligations to pay and discharge any
     Charges as  provided  in  paragraph  (1) above and  provided  no contest as
     described  in and as  permitted  under  paragraph  (2) above is in process,
     Lender, at its option and without notice, may pay such Charges and, in such
     event,  the amount of such  Charges so paid by Lender (a) shall be added to
     the Obligations,  (b) shall be secured by the Collateral,  and (c) shall be
     immediately due and payable,  on demand,  together with interest thereon at
     the Default Rate from the date of any such payment by Lender to the date of
     any repayment to Lender.

SECTION 1.61 BOOKS AND RECORDS.  Borrower shall keep adequate  records and books
of account with respect to its business  activities and the business  activities
of its  subsidiaries,  in which proper entries,  reflecting all of its financial
transactions, are made in accordance with GAAP.

SECTION 1.62 LITIGATION.  Borrower shall notify Lender in writing, promptly upon
learning thereof,  of any litigation  commenced  against  Borrower,  the Gateway
Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower, and of the institution against Borrower, the
Gateway  Tower  Owner  or  the  Nomura   Borrower  of  any  uninsured   suit  or
administrative  proceeding  that, in either case, if determined  adversely would
have a  Material  Adverse  Effect.  Any such  notification  shall be  deemed  to
automatically  update  Schedule 6.17 hereto to reflect the matters  contained in
such notification.


SECTION 1.63 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Subject to Borrower's right to contest Charges
to the extent and in the manner expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement,
Borrower  shall comply with all Laws  applicable to Borrower,  the Gateway Tower
Owner,  and each Property,  including,  with respect to Borrower and the Gateway
Tower Owner only, ERISA, those regarding the collection,  payment and deposit of
employees' income,  unemployment and social security taxes,  except in each case
where the failure to so comply will not have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 1.64 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY.

(1)  Borrower  shall,  and shall  cause the  Gateway  Tower Owner and the Nomura
     Borrower to, with respect to each  Property,  (a) maintain the Property and
     the improvements located thereon in good repair,  order and condition;  (b)
     make  all  necessary  repairs,   renewals,   replacements,   additions  and
     improvements to the Property;  (c) not abandon the Property; (d) not permit
     or suffer any waste to occur in respect of the  Property;  (e) refrain from
     impairing or  diminishing  the value or integrity of the Property or, as to
     each Borrower Property,  the priority and security of the Lien of Lender on
     the  Property;  (f)  except  for the work at the "128 Tech  Center"  Nomura
     Property, as described in the 2-year capital budget approved by Lender as a
     condition to the Initial Advance, not remove,  demolish or materially alter
     any of the  Property  without the prior  written  consent of Lender in each
     instance,  except that, Borrower shall have the right to remove and dispose
     of, free of the Lien of Lender,  such  fixtures as may,  from time to time,
     become  worn out or  obsolete,  provided  that,  simultaneously  with  such
     removal, any such fixtures shall be replaced with other fixtures that shall
     have the value and utility equal to that of the replaced fixtures and which
     shall  be free of any  security  agreement  or  other  Liens of any kind or
     nature whatsoever,  and by such removal and replacement,  Borrower shall be
     deemed to have subjected such replacement  fixtures to the Lien of the Deed
     of Trust encumbering such Property; (g) not execute any conditional bill of
     sale,  chattel  mortgage or other security  instrument  covering any of the
     equipment  located  at  any  Property  or  purchase  any  equipment  unless
     ownership  of the same will vest  unconditionally  in  Borrower,  free from
     encumbrances on delivery to the Property; (h) not make or permit to be made
     or  installed,  any  alterations  or  additions to the Property if doing so
     would,  in the  opinion  of  Lender,  impair to any extent the value of the
     Property;  and (i) not make,  suffer or permit any nuisance to exist on the
     Property or any portions  thereof,  except as to each of the  covenants (a)
     through  (i), to the extent  that the failure to do so (or to refrain  from
     doing so, as applicable) would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(2)  Borrower shall not permit,  and shall cause the Gateway Tower Owner and the
     Nomura Borrower to not permit, by any act or omission,  any building or any
     other improvement  located on any property which is not subject to the Lien
     of a Deed of Trust (or a  mortgage  or deed of trust  securing  the  Nomura
     Loan) to rely upon any  Property  or any  portion  thereof or any  interest
     therein to fulfill  any legal  requirements.  Borrower  shall not impair or
     permit the  impairment  of, by any act or  omission,  the  integrity of any
     Property  as one or more lots  separate  and apart from all other  premises
     owned by any other Person. Except as reflected in or otherwise contemplated
     by an Asset  Business  Plan,  Borrower  shall not  initiate,  or permit the
     initiation  of,  or  join  in,  any  zoning   change,   easement  or  other
     modification  of zoning  regulations  in respect of any Property that would
     result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Except as otherwise permitted herein,
     Borrower  shall not, and Borrower  shall not permit the Gateway Tower Owner
     or the  Nomura  Borrower  to,  (i) impose  any  restrictions,  covenant  or
     encumbrance  upon  any  Property,  execute  or file  any  subdivision  plot
     affecting any Property or consent to the  annexation of any Property to any
     municipality that would result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) permit
     or suffer  the  Property  to be used by the  public  or any  Person in such
     manner as might make  possible a claim of adverse usage or possession or of
     any implied right or easement.

SECTION 1.65 AGREEMENTS. Borrower shall, and shall cause the Gateway Tower Owner
and the Nomura  Borrower to,  perform,  within all required time periods  (after
giving effect to any applicable notice or grace periods), all of its obligations
and enforce all of its rights  under each  Material  Agreement  to which it is a
party if the failure to perform  such  obligations  or enforce such rights would
have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 1.66 EMPLOYEE  PLANS.  Borrower  shall not adopt any Plan, and shall not
permit the Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura Borrower to adopt any Plan, without
the consent of Lender.

SECTION 1.67 ACCESS.  Lender and any of its  officers,  employees  and/or agents
shall have the right, exercisable as frequently as Lender (or any representative
of Lender) reasonably determines to be appropriate, during normal business hours
(or at such  other  times  as may  reasonably  be  requested  by  Lender  or any
representative  of  Lender)  to  inspect  any  Property.  Lender  and any of its
officers,   employees  and/or  agents  shall  have  the  right,  exercisable  as
frequently as Lender (or any representative of Lender) reasonably  determines to
be  appropriate,  during  normal  business  hours (or at such other times as may
reasonably be requested by Lender or any representative of Lender),  to inspect,
audit and make  extracts from all of  Borrower's,  the Gateway Tower Owner's and
the Nomura  Borrower's  records,  files and books of account  at  Lender's  cost
except  in those  instances  in which  Lender's  audit  costs  are to be paid by
Borrower, as provided for elsewhere in this Agreement. Borrower shall, and shall
cause the Gateway Tower Owner and the Nomura  Borrower to,  deliver any document
or instrument reasonably necessary for Lender (or any representative of Lender),
as  any of  them  may  request,  to  obtain  records  from  any  service  bureau
maintaining  records  for  Borrower,  the  Gateway  Tower  Owner  or the  Nomura
Borrower. Borrower shall, and shall cause the Gateway Tower Owner and the Nomura
Borrower to, instruct its banking and other financial institutions and the Asset
Manager to make available to Lender such  information  and records as Lender (or
any representative of Lender) may reasonably request.

Section 8.1 TAXES ON PAYMENTS OR SECURITY.

(1)  To the extent  permitted by applicable Law and subject to the last sentence
     of this paragraph,  any and all payments by Borrower hereunder or under the
     Note shall be made free and clear of and without  deduction for any and all
     present  or  future  taxes,  levies,  mortgage  recording  taxes,  imposts,
     deductions,  charges or  withholdings,  and all  liabilities  with  respect
     thereto,  excluding  franchise taxes or taxes imposed on or measured by the
     net or gross  income,  capital  or  gross  receipts  of  Lender  (all  such
     non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,  charges, withholdings and
     liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If Borrower shall be
     required  by Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum  payable
     hereunder  or under the Note (for which Lender will not be able to obtain a
     refund or credit  against  taxes other than with  respect to the receipt of
     payments  pursuant  to the Note),  (a) the sum  payable to Lender  shall be
     increased as may be necessary so that after making all required  deductions
     (including  deductions  applicable  to  additional  sums payable under this
     Section), Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
     had no such deductions been made (but only to the extent that Lender is not
     able to obtain a refund or credit of such amounts  deducted),  (b) Borrower
     shall make such  deductions,  and (c)  Borrower  shall pay the full  amount
     deducted to the  relevant  taxing or other  authority  in  accordance  with
     applicable Law.  Borrower will not be required to pay any amounts  pursuant
     to this  paragraph (1) for Taxes to a subsequent  holder of the Note to the
     extent that GECC would not have been required to pay such Taxes.

(2)  To the extent  permitted by applicable Law and subject to the last sentence
     of this  paragraph,  Borrower  agrees to pay any present or future stamp or
     documentary taxes or any other sales,  transfer,  excise or property taxes,
     charges or similar  levies that arise from any payment  made  hereunder  or
     under  the  Note  or  from  the  execution,  sale,  transfer,  delivery  or
     registration  of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Note,
     the Loan Documents and any other  agreements and  instruments  contemplated
     thereby  (hereinafter  referred to as "OTHER  Taxes")  except for  excluded
     taxes  described in paragraph  (1) above.  Borrower will not be required to
     pay any  amounts to a  subsequent  holder of the Note as  provided  in this
     paragraph  (2) to the extent that Other  Taxes would not have been  payable
     had GECC continued to hold the Note.

(3)  To the extent permitted by applicable Law,  Borrower shall indemnify Lender
     for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes  (including  any Taxes or Other
     Taxes imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts payable under this Section),
     but not excluded  taxes  described in paragraph (1) above or Taxes or Other
     Taxes imposed due to any action of Lender, paid by Lender and any liability
     (including  penalties,  interest and  expenses)  arising  therefrom or with
     respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
     legally  asserted.  This  indemnification  shall be made within ninety (90)
     days from the date Lender makes written demand therefor.

(4)  Within  ninety (90) days after the date of any  payment of Taxes,  Borrower
     shall  furnish to Lender,  at the address to which notices to Lender are to
     be sent under this Agreement, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
     evidencing payment thereof.

(5)  Without  prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of Borrower,  the
     agreements and obligations of Borrower and Lender contained in this Section
     shall survive the payment in full of principal  and interest  hereunder and
     under the Note and the termination of this Agreement.

(6)  Lender shall promptly  notify Borrower in writing upon receipt by Lender of
     notice of any pending or threatened  federal,  state or local tax audits or
     assessments  for which  Borrower  would be  required  to  indemnify  Lender
     pursuant to this Section.  Borrower shall be entitled to participate at its
     own  expense  in the  defense  of any tax  claim  which may be  subject  to
     indemnification  by Borrower  pursuant to this  Section.  Lender  shall not
     settle any such tax claim without the prior written consent of Borrower.

(7)  If Lender is  entitled  to a refund or credit  relating  to  amounts  which
     Borrower has paid Lender  pursuant to this Section,  Lender shall  promptly
     pay to  Borrower  the  amount of such  refund or credit  together  with any
     interest  thereon  upon  receipt  thereof.  Upon  reliance of an opinion of
     counsel  that  provides  that there is a  reasonable  basis for such claim,
     Borrower can require Lender to file all necessary or appropriate  tax forms
     to  obtain  a  refund  or  credit  of an  amount  for  which  Borrower  has
     indemnified Lender.

SECTION 1.68  ENFORCEMENT.  At Borrower's  sole cost and expense,  Borrower will
appear in and defend any action  growing out of or in any manner  connected with
any of the Collateral  Documents,  or the obligations or liabilities of Borrower
or any other party thereunder,  or any guarantee thereof,  and Lender, if made a
party to any such  action,  may employ  counsel and incur and pay the  necessary
costs and expenses and reasonable  attorneys' fees, and all such sums,  together
with  interest  thereon  at the  Default  Rate,  shall  immediately  be due from
Borrower, shall be added to the Obligations and secured by the Collateral.

SECTION 1.69 ASSET MANAGEMENT.

(1)  Borrower  shall  not take or permit  the  Gateway  Tower  Owner to take any
     action that is in contravention of the Agreement Regarding Asset Management
     (including  the  payment  to Asset  Manager  of any fee prior to making the
     payment of any  principal,  interest  or other sums then due under the Loan
     Documents).

(2)  At Borrower's sole cost and expense, Borrower will appear in and defend any
     action growing out of or in any manner  connected with the Asset  Manager's
     obligations  (with  respect  to the  Properties)  under  the WWG  Operating
     Agreement or the  obligations or liabilities of Borrower or any other party
     thereunder,  and  Lender,  if made a party to any such  action,  may employ
     counsel and incur and pay the  necessary  out-of-pocket  costs and expenses
     and reasonable  attorneys' fees, and all such sums,  together with interest
     thereon at the Default Rate, shall immediately be due from Borrower,  shall
     be added to the Obligations and secured by the Collateral.

SECTION 1.70 MAINTENANCE OF REPRESENTATIONS;  SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE.  Borrower
shall cause the  representations  set forth in Article 6 hereof (other than with
respect to the representations  that are given to the knowledge of Borrower,  as
to which no further  representation  shall be deemed given) to remain true as of
the date of the  funding of any  Advance  (I.E.,  the  representations  shall be
updated and made as of such later dates rather than restated at such later dates
as of the Closing  Date,  except  that no such  update  shall be required if the
matter to be  disclosed  would not have a  Material  Adverse  Effect).  Lender's
remedies for a breach of any such updated representation  regarding any Property
shall be the same as for a breach of a  representation,  as described in Section
8.17. From time to time as may be necessary (in the event that such  information
is not otherwise delivered by Borrower to Lender pursuant to this Agreement), so
long as there are Obligations outstanding hereunder, Borrower will supplement or
amend  each  Schedule  or  representation  herein  with  respect  to any  matter
hereafter arising which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement,
would have been  required to be set forth or described in such Schedule or as an
exception  to  such   representation  or  which  is  necessary  to  correct  any
information  in  such  Schedule  or  representation   which  has  been  rendered
inaccurate  thereby,  provided,  however,  that any notice  delivered  to Lender
hereunder in respect of any information that relates to a  representation  shall
be deemed to constitute an exception to such representation  whether or not such
information would otherwise appear on a Schedule.

SECTION 1.71 PROPERTY DOCUMENTS;  ASSET BUSINESS PLANS.  Borrower shall promptly
deliver to Lender  true and  correct  copies of any and all  Property  Documents
(other than internal Borrower, Gateway Tower Owner and Nomura Borrower memoranda
and communications between Borrower, Gateway Tower Owner and Nomura Borrower and
their respective  counsel)  received by Borrower,  Gateway Tower Owner or Nomura
Borrower  at any time  during the term of the Loan.  Borrower  shall  deliver to
Lender copies of all Asset Business Plans (including  annual budgets) within the
time  periods set forth for  delivery of such Asset  Business  Plans  (including
annual budgets) to Borrower pursuant to the WWG Operating Agreement,  subject to
reasonable extensions.

SECTION 1.72 INTEREST RATE CAP  AGREEMENT.  Within  fourteen (14) days after the
Closing Date, Borrower agrees to enter into and at all times thereafter maintain
an interest rate cap agreement or other  hedging  device in connection  with the
Loan,  which  agreement or hedging device shall have a notional  amount not less
than the  outstanding  Loan  balance and shall have a strike  price of, or shall
otherwise cap Borrower's  LIBOR Rate exposure at, not more than 300 basis points
in excess of the LIBOR  Rate in  effect  on the  Closing  Date.  The form of the
interest rate cap agreement or other hedging  device  required  pursuant to this
Section,   and  the   counterparty  to  such  agreement,   shall  be  reasonably
satisfactory  to Lender.  Borrower  shall,  upon  execution  of such  agreement,
deliver to Lender the Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Cap Agreement, duly
executed and delivered by Borrower in favor of Lender, together with the consent
of the counterparty thereunder to such collateral assignment.  The interest rate
cap agreement shall at all times cover the outstanding Loan balance.

SECTION 1.73 INDEMNIFICATION.  Subject to the provisions of Section 12.1 hereof,
Borrower shall  indemnify and hold Lender  harmless from and against any and all
suits, actions,  proceedings,  claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements,   including  those
incurred  upon any  appeal)  which may be  instituted  or  asserted  against  or
incurred  by Lender as the  result of its  having  entered  into any of the Loan
Documents or extended  credit  hereunder  (excluding  those  arising  solely and
directly from Lender's gross  negligence or willful  misconduct),  including any
suits, actions,  proceedings,  claims, damages, losses,  liabilities or expenses
arising in connection with any brokerage,  finders' or other commissions or fees
which any broker or other Person claims is owing in connection  with  Borrower's
or the Gateway  Tower  Owner's  acquisition  of the  Borrower  Properties  or in
connection with the Loan or the transactions  contemplated by the Loan Documents
(except to the extent such Person claims that such commissions or fees are owing
solely by virtue of its dealings with Lender).

SECTION 1.74 IMPAIRED PROPERTY. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
if any  representation or covenant herein,  or in any other Loan Document,  with
respect to any Property has been breached and, in Lender's  reasonable  opinion,
such breach impairs the value of such Property (any such Property being referred
to  herein as an  "IMPAIRED  PROPERTY")  by at least  five  percent  (5%) of its
Property Basis or $250,000,  whichever is less, then (unless  Borrower proves to
Lender's reasonable  satisfaction that such breach was appropriately  considered
in the determination of the initial Property Basis of the Impaired Property,  or
Borrower  establishes a cash Reserve which is sufficient in Lender's  reasonable
judgment to cure such breach and is deposited into a segregated  account pledged
to Lender such that Lender shall have a first priority  perfected lien upon such
Reserve,  in either which case,  no default  shall be deemed to exist)  Borrower
shall either (1) cure such breach to Lender's reasonable satisfaction, or (2) at
Borrower's  option (a) pay to Lender the  Adjusted  Loan Basis for the  Impaired
Property and the other sums  payable to Lender under  Section 2.4 or Section 2.5
(as  applicable)  in  connection  with a release of such  Property from the Loan
Documents  or the Nomura Loan  Documents,  as  applicable  (at which time Lender
shall release such Property,  if a Borrower Property,  from the Lien of the Loan
Documents),  or (b) pay to  Lender  such sum as  will,  in  Lender's  reasonable
opinion,  reduce the Adjusted Loan Basis of such Impaired  Property to an amount
equal to not more than eighty  percent  (80%) of the fair  market  value of such
Property (provided that if the Impaired Property is a Nomura Property,  then the
Adjusted  Loan Basis shall be reduced to an amount  equal to (i) 80% of the fair
market value of such Property minus (ii) the Nomura Loan balance), as determined
by Lender in its  reasonable  discretion;  provided,  however,  that the  option
described in clause (b) shall not be available if such breach  impairs the value
of the Impaired Property by at least  twenty-five  percent (25%) of its Property
Basis. At Borrower's option, and without prepayment premium or penalty, Borrower
can pay the amount  described in clauses (a) or (b) either in a lump sum payment
or through  payment to Lender of one hundred  percent  (100%) of Operating  Cash
Flow,  after  payment of (1) debt service on the Loan and on the Nomura Loan and
(2) the Asset  Management  Fee (except to the extent  deducted  as an  Operating
Expense in  determining  Operating  Cash Flow),  until such sum has been paid in
full. In the event  Borrower has elected to make such  payments  from  Operating
Cash  Flow and such  Operating  Cash  Flow is not  sufficient  to  complete  the
payments  required  by said  clauses  (a) or (b)  within 180 days after the date
Lender asserted the respective  breach in question,  then upon the expiration of
said 180 day period, Borrower shall be required to pay an amount which, together
with all such prior payments  received by Lender from Operating Cash Flow, shall
be  sufficient  to make such  payment as  described in clauses (a) or (b) above.
Lender's remedies as set forth in this Section shall be exercisable by Lender at
any time and from time to time during the term of the Loan.

obligation,  to cure any "Event of  Default"  under the Nomura  Loan  Documents.
Borrower agrees to reimburse Lender on demand for any and all costs and expenses
incurred by Lender in connection  with curing such an Event of Default under the
Nomura Loan Documents.

shall not permit the Nomura Borrower to obtain or otherwise agree to any release
or forbearance of any of the Nomura Borrower's obligations under the Nomura Loan

Properties  (or any of them)  cease to be subject to the Lien of the Nomura Loan
Documents or the Lien of the loan  documents  evidencing or securing a refinance
of the Nomura  Properties  permitted  under  Section  9.11 (but such  Properties
continue  to be owned by the Nomura  Borrower),  then  Borrower  shall cause the
Nomura Borrower to lease, manage and otherwise operate such Nomura Properties in
accordance with the requirements  contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents,  and shall cause the Nomura Borrower to execute and deliver to Lender
such deeds of trust and other  security  documents,  and to obtain for  Lender's
benefit such title insurance,  as Lender reasonably  requires in order to obtain
valid,  insured,  first  position Liens on such Nomura  Properties  insuring the
Obligations.

Lender evidence reasonably  satisfactory to Lender that Borrower has transferred
the  Shattuck  Office  Center  Property to another  Person,  which Person may be
related to Borrower so long as Borrower is not directly or indirectly  liable on
a recourse basis for any such Person's  indebtedness or obligations to any other
Person.

case that such  investment  matures within one year from the date of acquisition
thereof.

SECTION 1.81      INDEBTEDNESS.

(1)  Borrower  shall  not,  and shall not  permit the  Gateway  Tower  Owner to,

     entered  into in the ordinary  course of  Borrower's  or the Gateway  Tower
     Owner's  business,  and (e)  Indebtedness  incurred in connection  with the
     indemnifications given to the Title Company in connection with the issuance
     of the Title  Policies  and  endorsements  required  pursuant  hereto which
     Indebtedness  shall be subordinate in all respects to the  Obligations  (it
     being  specifically   agreed,   however,   that  payments  made  under  the
     indemnifications  prior to an Event of  Default  for the  purpose of paying
     delinquent real estate taxes shall not be a default hereunder).

(2)  Borrower shall not, and shall not permit the Gateway Tower Owner to, engage
     in  any  sale-leaseback  or  similar  transaction   involving  any  of  the
     Collateral.

     Schedule 6.26 hereto.

SECTION 1.82      STRUCTURE; TRANSFERS.

(1)  Borrower shall not amend the Operating Agreement,  and shall not permit the
     Gateway Tower Owner, Wells Avenue Holdings, WASH Manager or Nomura Borrower
     to amend their respective operating agreements,  in any way that would have
     a Material Adverse Effect.

(2)  No member of Borrower,  the Gateway Tower Owner,  WWG, WWPII,  Wells Avenue
     Holdings,  WASH Manager or Nomura  Borrower shall assign,  transfer,  sell,
     convey, encumber, pledge or hypothecate, whether directly or indirectly, by

     membership  interests in Borrower,  the Gateway  Tower Owner,  WWG,  WWPII,
     Wells Avenue Holdings, WASH Manager or Nomura Borrower or permit any change
     in its ownership. Notwithstanding the foregoing (and without limiting other
     Transfers not prohibited by the foregoing),  the following  Transfers shall
     be  permitted  so long as one or more of the  Whitehall  Parties  or (after
     January 1, 2004 only) Wellsford, individually or collectively, at all times
     during  the  Term  retain  ultimate  decision  making  authority  over  the
     management and operations of Borrower:  (a) Transfers of interests  between
     WHWEL,  WXI/WWG and W/WGH and transfers of interests in WHWEL,  WXI/WWG and
     W/WGH between Whitehall Parties,  provided that in each instance no cash is

     account of the transferor in connection  with such transfer,  (b) Transfers
     of  interests  in WCPT not held by  Wellsford as of the Closing Date (which
     interests do not, and shall not,  exceed 2% of the interests in WCPT),  (c)
     any  conversion or Transfer (as defined in the WWG Operating  Agreement) of
     any interest  held by any Saracen  Member (as defined in the WWG  Operating
     Agreement),  (d) from and after January 1, 2004, the  acquisition by either
     the  Whitehall  Parties  or  Wellsford  of  all of  the  other's  ownership
     interests in WWG pursuant to the "buy-sell" provisions in Section 8.2(c) of
     the WWG  Operating  Agreement,  and (e)  Transfers  (as  defined in the WWG
     Operating  Agreement)  by the  Whitehall  Parties or Wellsford of up to ten
     percent (10%) of their respective interests in WWG for the benefit of their
     respective  employees,  subject  to  and  in  strict  accordance  with  the
     provisions added to Section 8.1(a) of the WWG Operating  Agreement pursuant
     to Section  2.24 of the First  Amendment  thereto  dated  December 21, 2000
     (with no further  revision or  amendment  to such  section).  If either the
     Whitehall  Parties or Wellsford  sells or otherwise  transfers to the other
     100% of their ownership  interests in WWG as permitted in clause (d) of the
     preceding  sentence,  (i) such  selling/transferring  Persons shall have no
     liability  under the Joinder  with respect to events  occurring  after such
     Persons  cease to have any interest in WWG, and (ii) unless the  obligation
     to maintain the Indemnitors'  Net Worth  requirement has been terminated in
     accordance  with Section 2.10, it shall be a condition to any such transfer
     between the Whitehall Parties and Wellsford that the transferee can satisfy
     the Indemnitors' Net Worth requirement under the Indemnification Agreement,
     without regard to the Net Worth of the transferor. Notwithstanding anything
     contained  in  this  Agreement  to  the  contrary,  the  occurrence  of any
     violation of this Section  9.4(2),  shall  constitute an immediate Event of
     Default under this  Agreement  which shall not be subject to any notice and
     cure  provisions set forth in Section 10.1 hereof,  and which shall entitle
     Lender to immediately commence exercising its remedies hereunder.

(3)  Borrower  shall not, and shall not permit the Gateway  Tower Owner to, take
     any  action  or  forbear  from  taking  any  action   (including,   without
     limitation,  the  granting of  consents to actions  taken or proposed to be
     taken by others) that would cause Borrower or the Gateway Tower Owner to be
     taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.

SECTION 1.83 MAINTENANCE OF BUSINESS.  Borrower shall not engage in any business
other than the  business of owning and  operating  the Borrower  Properties  and

Avenue Holdings.  Borrower shall not permit the Gateway Tower Owner to engage in
any business  other than the business of owning and  operating the Gateway Tower
Property.  WWPII  shall not engage in any  business  other than the  business of
owning  100% of the  membership  interests  in  Borrower  and owning 100% of the
membership  interests in Wellsford One Mall,  L.L.C.,  which  indirectly owns an

     into or be a party to any  transaction  with  any  Affiliate  of  Borrower,
     except for (a) transactions  contemplated by this Agreement with respect to
     the refinancing of a Property, and (b) any other arrangement, provided that
     the terms are (i) commercially reasonable and competitive with amounts that
     would be paid to or received from third parties on an "arm's-length"  basis
     and (ii)  reduced  to a  writing  covering  all  material  aspects  of such
     arrangement.  Lender  acknowledges  that,  pursuant  to the  WWG  Operating
     Agreement,  the Asset  Manager  may  receive  additional  compensation  (in
     addition to the Asset  Management  Fee) for performing  certain  additional
     services  for  Borrower  and the Gateway  Tower  Owner with  respect to the
     Properties,  as described in Section 9.2(b) to the WWG Operating Agreement.
     Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Borrower and the Gateway
     Tower Owner from compensating the Asset Manager for performing  services in
     addition to the asset  management  services for which the Asset  Manager is
     compensated  by the  Asset  Management  Fee,  so long as in each  case  the
     arrangement  complies  with the  requirements  of  clause  (b) of the first
     sentence of this Section 9.6(1).

(2)  Borrower  shall not, and shall not permit the Gateway Tower Owner to, enter
     into any agreement or  transaction  to pay to any Person any  management or
     similar fee based on or related to  Borrower's or the Gateway Tower Owner's
     operating  performance  or income or any  percentage  thereof,  nor pay any
     management  or similar fee to an  Affiliate,  provided  that the  foregoing
     shall not prohibit  Borrower from making  distributions to WWPII which will
     ultimately be used to compensate  the Asset Manager under the WWG Operating
     Agreement.

SECTION 1.85 LIENS.  Borrower shall not create or permit, and Borrower shall not
allow the Gateway Tower Owner, Wells Avenue Holdings, WASH Manager or the Nomura
Borrower  to create or permit,  any Lien  (unless  Borrower  proves to  Lender's
reasonable  satisfaction that any such Lien was appropriately  considered in the
determination  of the initial  Property  Basis of such  Property)  on any of its
properties or assets  (including the Shattuck Office Center Property) except, as
to Borrower, the Gateway Tower Owner and Nomura Borrower only:

(1)  presently existing or hereinafter  created Liens in favor of Lender (or, as
     to the Nomura Borrower, the Nomura Lender);

(2)  Permitted  Encumbrances  (provided  that Borrower also may permit a Lien on
     each Property and the Shattuck  Office Center  Property for current but not
     delinquent  property taxes,  assessments or other  governmental  charges or
     levies  against such Property or the Shattuck  Office Center  Property,  as
     applicable);

(3)  Liens securing Indebtedness specifically approved by Lender in writing;

(4)  non-monetary  Liens which individually or in the aggregate would not have a
     Material Adverse Effect; and

(5)  monetary  Liens which  individually  or in the  aggregate  would not have a
     Material Adverse Effect and for which Borrower (or the Nomura Borrower) has
     established a reserve with Lender (or the Nomura  Lender,  as to the Nomura
     Borrower)  necessary  for  the  removal  of  such  Lien,  and  Borrower  is
     diligently  pursuing cure and/or  contesting  the Lien in  accordance  with
     Section 8.2(2) hereof (or, as to the Nomura  Borrower,  in accordance  with
     the Nomura Loan Documents).

SECTION  1.86  EVENTS OF  DEFAULT.  Borrower  shall not take or omit to take any
action,  and shall not permit the Gateway Tower Owner or the Nomura  Borrower to
take or omit to take any action,  which act or omission  would  constitute (1) a
Potential Default or an Event of Default pursuant to, or noncompliance  with any
of, the terms of any of the Loan  Documents or the Ancillary  Agreements,  (2) a
"Default" or an "Event of Default" pursuant to the Nomura Loan Documents, or (3)
a material  default or an event of default  (after notice and  applicable  grace
periods  set  forth in such  other  contract  or  instrument)  pursuant  to,  or
noncompliance  with,  any other contract or instrument to which it is a party or
by which it or any of its property is bound,  or any  document  creating a Lien,
unless  such  default,  event of  default  or  non-compliance  would  not have a
Material  Adverse Effect;  provided,  however,  that for purposes of this clause
(3), no Material  Adverse Effect shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of
a material  adverse  effect on any Property  individually  unless such  material
adverse effect shall also result in a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower or the
Properties as a whole.

SECTION  1.87  GROUND  LEASES.  Except for the  Challenger  Road  Ground  Lease,

guarantor or other surety with respect to any ground leases.

SECTION 1.88 MATERIAL  AGREEMENTS.  Borrower shall not enter into, and shall not
permit  the  Gateway  Tower  Owner or the Nomura  Borrower  to enter  into,  any

be required for  Borrower or the Gateway  Tower Owner to enter into any contract
for work to be  performed  or services to be  rendered  in  connection  with (1)
Tenant  Improvements  for Leases which are entered into in accordance  with this
Agreement and (2) Capital Expenditures approved by Lender.

SECTION 1.89 LIMITATION ON SECURITIES  ISSUANCES.  Borrower shall not permit the
Gateway Tower Owner, Wells Avenue Holdings,  WASH Manager or the Nomura Borrower
to issue, any membership  interests or securities other than those issued on the
date hereof; provided, however, that this provision is not intended to limit the
ability of the existing members in these entities to provide  additional capital
contributions to such entities.

SECTION 1.90 APPROVAL  RIGHTS OF BORROWER  WITH RESPECT TO THE NOMURA  BORROWER.
Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender,  permit or give
its consent or approval to the  cancellation,  surrender or  termination  of any
Lease  within the Nomura  Properties  except as  expressly  permitted  under the

     omit to take any action, as a result of which Nomura Borrower, WASH Manager
     or Wells Avenue  Holdings  would be  dissolved,  wound up or  liquidated in
     whole or in  part,  (c)  engage  in any  business  activity  not  currently
     described in the certificate of formation or operating  agreement of Nomura

     or terminate the certificate of formation or operating  agreement of Nomura

                     EVENTS OF DEFAULT; RIGHTS AND REMEDIES

SECTION  1.91  EVENTS  OF  DEFAULT.  The  occurrence  of any  one or more of the
following events  (regardless of the reason therefor) shall constitute an "EVENT
OF DEFAULT" hereunder:

(1)  Borrower  shall fail to make any payment of principal of, or interest on or
     any  other  amount  owing in  respect  of,  the  Loan,  or any of the other
     Obligations  when due and payable or  declared  due and  payable,  and such
     failure  shall have remained  unremedied  for a period of five (5) Business
     Days after such failure, except that with respect to expenses payable under
     this Agreement,  or other  Obligations  owing under any Loan Document other
     than this  Agreement,  such failure  shall have remained  unremedied  for a
     period of five (5) Business Days after Borrower has received notice of such
     failure from Lender.

(2)  Borrower  shall  fail or  neglect to  perform,  keep or  observe  any other
     provision  of this  Agreement  or of any of the other  Loan  Documents,  or
     Borrower  shall  fail or  neglect to  perform,  keep or observe  any of the
     provisions of any other Loan Document and the same shall remain  unremedied
     for a period of thirty  (30) days  after  Borrower  shall  receive  written
     notice of any such failure from Lender; provided,  however, if such failure
     or neglect is of the type which is curable but which cannot be cured within
     such  30-day  period,  such  failure  or  neglect  shall not be an Event of
     Default  if  Borrower,   within  such  30-day  period,  has  commenced  and
     thereafter is diligently  pursuing such cure, in which event Borrower shall
     have such  additional  time as is reasonably  required to effect such cure,
     but in no event in excess of 180 days;  and provided  further that a breach
     of a covenant with respect to one or more  Properties  shall not constitute
     an Event  of  Default  hereunder  if such  breach  gives  rise to  Lender's
     remedies  with  respect to an  Impaired  Property,  so long as  Borrower is
     performing its obligations under the provisions hereof concerning  Impaired
     Properties.

(3)  Any representation or warranty herein, or in any other Loan Document, or in
     any  written  statement  pursuant  thereto  or  hereto,  report,  financial
     statement,  or certificate made or delivered to Lender by Borrower shall be
     untrue or incorrect in any  material  respect,  as of the date when made or
     deemed made  (including  those made or deemed made in connection  with each
     Advance) and such representation or warranty, if made by Borrower after the
     Closing  Date,  shall,  if the  condition  that gave rise to the  breach of
     representation  or warranty  is capable of being  cured,  remain  untrue or
     incorrect for a period ending on the first to occur of (a) thirty (30) days
     after Borrower has received  written notice of the falsity or inaccuracy of
     such  representation or warranty from Lender, or (b) thirty (30) days after
     Borrower  shall  become  aware of such  falsity  or  inaccuracy;  provided,
     however,  that if the  breach of the  representation  or  warranty  is of a
     nature which is curable but which cannot be cured within such 30-day period
     such  failure  shall not be an Event of Default if  Borrower,  within  such
     30-day period, shall have commenced to cure the condition that gave rise to
     the breach of representation or warranty and thereafter  diligently pursues
     such cure, in which event  Borrower shall have such  additional  time as is
     reasonably  required to effect such cure,  but in no event in excess of one
     hundred  eighty  (180)  days;  and  provided  further  that a  breach  of a
     representation  or  warranty  shall  not  constitute  an Event  of  Default
     hereunder if such breach gives rise to Lender's remedies with respect to an
     Impaired Property,  so long as Borrower is performing its obligations under
     the provisions hereof concerning Impaired Properties.

(4)  Any of the assets of Borrower or the Gateway Tower Owner to which in excess
     of $100,000 in aggregate  Adjusted Loan Basis has been  allocated  shall be
     attached,  seized,  levied upon or subjected to a writ or distress warrant,

     assignee  for the benefit of  creditors  of  Borrower or the Gateway  Tower
     Owner and shall remain unstayed or undismissed for thirty (30)  consecutive
     days;  or any Person other than  Borrower or the Gateway  Tower Owner shall
     apply for the  appointment  of a receiver,  trustee or custodian for any of
     the assets of  Borrower or the  Gateway  Tower  Owner and such  application
     shall remain unstayed or undismissed for thirty (30)  consecutive  days; or
     Borrower  or the  Gateway  Tower  Owner  shall have  concealed,  removed or
     permitted to be concealed or removed, any part of its property, with intent
     to  hinder,  delay  or  defraud  its  creditors  or any of  them or made or
     suffered  a  transfer  of any  of  its  property  or  the  incurring  of an
     obligation  which  may  be  fraudulent  under  any  bankruptcy,  fraudulent
     conveyance or other similar Law.

     Gateway  Tower Owner in a court  having  competent  jurisdiction  seeking a
     decree or order in respect of Borrower or the Gateway Tower Owner (a) under
     Title  11 of the  United  States  Code,  as now  constituted  or  hereafter

     shall not be (i) fully  covered  (taking  into account the  deductible)  by
     insurance  maintained  by Borrower or the Gateway Tower Owner in accordance
     with the requirements of this Agreement,  or (ii) vacated,  stayed, bonded,
     paid or discharged for a period of thirty (30) days.

(8)  Any provision of any Collateral Document,  after delivery thereof shall for
     any reason (other than being  contrary to applicable  Law or public policy,
     and  other  than by  Lender's  acts)  cease to be valid or  enforceable  in
     accordance  with its terms,  or any  security  interest  created  under any
     Collateral  Document shall cease to be a valid and perfected first priority
     security interest or Lien (subject to Permitted  Encumbrances and except as
     otherwise stated therein and other than being contrary to applicable Law or
     public  policy,  and other than by Lender's  acts) in any of the Collateral
     purported to be covered thereby.

(9)  Asset Manager  defaults under the WWG Operating  Agreement (with respect to
     its obligations thereunder regarding the Properties, or any of them) beyond
     applicable  grace  periods  or  ceases  to act as  asset  manager  for  the
     Properties  under the WWG Operating  Agreement unless in each case Borrower
     has replaced Asset Manager as manager with a manager satisfactory to Lender
     in its reasonable  discretion within thirty (30) days. Lender  acknowledges
     and agrees that, subject to Section 9.6(1)(b),  Archon Group, L.P. would be
     an acceptable  replacement manager, so long as Archon Group, L.P. is not in
     breach or default of its obligations  under any asset management  agreement
     or collateral  assignment  thereof  entered into by Archon  Group,  L.P. in
     connection with other loans by Lender to Affiliates of any of the Whitehall
     Parties.

(10) The  occurrence of any breach or default under the  Challenger  Road Ground
     Lease beyond any applicable grace or cure period,  or the occurrence of any
     other event which would  entitle the landlord to terminate  the  Challenger
     Road Ground Lease.

(11) Any "Event of Default" occurs under the Nomura Loan Documents.

(12) At any time prior to the first to occur of (a) the  release of the  Gateway
     Tower Property from the Lien of the Loan Documents, and Lender's receipt of
     the Release  Payment in connection  therewith,  in accordance  with Section
     2.4,  or (b) the  transfer  of the  Gateway  Tower  Property to Borrower in
     accordance  with  Section  2.10,  the  Indemnitors'  Net Worth is less than
     $100,000,000;  provided,  however, that an Event of Default shall not exist
     under this Section  10.1(12) if, within thirty (30) days after Borrower has
     received  written notice from Lender,  (i) the  Indemnitors'  Net Worth has
     been increased to at least $100,000,000, (ii) the Gateway Tower Property is
     released from the Lien of the Loan  Documents,  and Lender has received the
     Release Payment in connection therewith, in accordance with Section 2.4, or
     (iii) the Gateway Tower  Property is  transferred to Borrower in accordance
     with Section 2.10,  provided that if, within five (5) days after receipt of
     Lender's  default notice,  Lender receives  written notice from Borrower of
     Borrower's  intention to cure the default in  accordance  with clause (iii)
     above,  then such 30-day cure period shall  commence  running from the date
     Borrower has received  both (A) written  notice from Lender  describing  in
     reasonable  detail all items  Lender will  require  Borrower to execute and
     deliver  pursuant  to Section  2.10 and (B) copies of the  documents  which
     Lender will require to be executed pursuant to Sections 2.10(3) and (7).

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein or in the other Loan Documents,
if an Event of Default (which arises from the  occurrence of a breach,  default,
failure of condition or other event for which no cure period is provided herein)
or a Potential Default occurs hereunder or under another Loan Document because a
representation  or warranty or a covenant is breached as it affects a particular
Property (a "DEFAULT PROPERTY"),  such Event of Default or Potential Default may
be cured by paying to  Lender,  as the  Release  Payment or Nomura  Payment  (as
applicable) for such Default  Property,  the Adjusted Loan Basis for the Default
Property  plus (if such  Property is the last  remaining  Nomura  Property to be
released) any additional  amount  payable  pursuant to Section  2.5(1)(d)  above
(together with all other sums payable to Lender in connection  with a release of
such Property pursuant to Section 2.4 or, as to the Nomura Properties, a release
pursuant to Section 2.5) within ten (10) days of written  notice from Lender (as
to any such Event of Default),  or within the applicable cure period provided in
this Section  10.1 (as to any such  Potential  Default),  in which event (if the
Default  Property is a Borrower  Property) Lender shall release all of its Liens
on the Default  Property and all of the  personal  property  Collateral  related
solely  thereto.  Lender  agrees that an Event of Default  arising under Section
10.1(10) shall cause the Challenger Road Property to be a Default Property,  and
that such an Event of Default is curable under this paragraph.

SECTION 1.92      REMEDIES.

(1)  If any Event of Default  (other  than an Event of Default  which is curable
     under the last  paragraph  of Section 10.1 and as to which the ten-day cure
     period has not yet  expired)  shall have  occurred and be  continuing,  (a)
     Lender may, without notice, terminate this facility with respect to funding
     further  Advances,  whereupon no additional  Loan proceeds  shall be funded
     hereunder,   and/or  (b)  Lender  may:  (i)  without  notice,  declare  all
     Obligations to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon all such Obligations
     shall become and be due and payable,  without presentment,  demand, protest
     or  further  notice  of any  kind,  all of which  are  expressly  waived by
     Borrower;  provided,  however,  that  upon  the  occurrence  of an Event of
     Default specified in Sections 10.1(4),  (5) or (6) hereof, such Obligations
     shall  become  due and  payable  without  declaration,  notice or demand by
     Lender;  and (ii)  exercise  all  remedies  available to Lender in the Loan
     Documents, at law, in equity or otherwise.

(2)  Upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default  Lender shall have the right to
     request Borrower to, and Borrower shall,  execute new promissory notes (and
     appropriate  amendments to the other Loan  Documents)  aggregating the then
     outstanding  balance due on the Loan.  Borrower hereby designates Lender as
     its  attorney-in-fact  to execute any such documents on behalf of Borrower,
     such appointment being coupled with interest, and such designation shall be
     irrevocable.

SECTION  1.93  WAIVERS BY  BORROWER  Except as  otherwise  provided  for in this
Agreement  and  applicable  Law,  Borrower  waives (1)  presentment,  demand and
protest and notice of presentment,  dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate and
notice of acceleration, (2) all rights to notice and a hearing prior to Lender's
taking  possession  or control of, or to Lender's  replevy,  attachment  or levy
upon,  the  Collateral  or any bond or  security  which might be required by any
court prior to  allowing  Lender to exercise  any of its  remedies,  and (3) the
benefit of all valuation,  appraisal and exemption Laws.  Borrower  acknowledges
that  it has  been  advised  by  counsel  of its  choice  with  respect  to this
Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents  and the  transactions  evidenced  by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 1.94 RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default,  Lender is hereby  authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest  extent  permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final) at any time
held (other than deposits held by Borrower in trust for other  persons,  such as
Security  Deposits,  and other such deposits) and other indebtedness at any time
owing by Lender to or for the credit or the account of Borrower  against any and
all of  the  Obligations  of  Borrower  now or  hereafter  existing  under  this
Agreement  and the Note held by  Lender,  irrespective  of whether or not Lender
shall have made any demand  under this  Agreement  or any such Note and although
such  obligations  may be unmatured.  Lender agrees  promptly to notify Borrower
after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;  provided,  however,
that the  failure to give such  notice  shall not affect  the  validity  of such
set-off and application. The rights of Lender under this Section are in addition
to other rights and remedies  (including  other rights of set-off)  which Lender
may have.

SECTION 1.96 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of
the Loan Documents shall be effective  unless in writing and signed by the party
against whom enforcement is sought.

SECTION 1.97  LIMITATION ON INTEREST.  It is the intention of the parties hereto
to conform  strictly to  applicable  usury  Laws.  Accordingly,  all  agreements
between  Borrower  and Lender  with  respect  to the Loan are  hereby  expressly
limited so that in no event,  whether by reason of  acceleration  of maturity or
otherwise,  shall the  amount  paid or agreed to be paid to Lender or charged by
Lender for the use,  forbearance  or detention of the money to be lent hereunder
or  otherwise,  exceed the maximum  amount  allowed by Law. If the Loan would be
usurious  under  applicable Law (including the Laws of the State and the Laws of
the United States of America), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Loan Documents:  (1) the aggregate of all  consideration  which  constitutes
interest under applicable Law that is contracted for, taken,  reserved,  charged
or received under the Loan  Documents  shall under no  circumstances  exceed the
maximum  amount of interest  allowed by applicable  Law, and any excess shall be
credited  on the Note by the holder  thereof  (or,  if the Note has been paid in
full, refunded to Borrower);  and (2) if maturity is accelerated by reason of an
election by Lender,  or in the event of any prepayment,  then any  consideration
which  constitutes  interest  may never  include  more than the  maximum  amount
allowed by applicable Law. In such case,  excess interest,  if any, provided for
in the Loan Documents or otherwise,  to the extent  permitted by applicable Law,
shall be  amortized,  prorated,  allocated  and spread  from the date of advance
until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is uniform through the
term hereof. If such  amortization,  proration,  allocation and spreading is not
permitted  under  applicable  Law, then such excess  interest  shall be canceled
automatically  as of the  date  of  such  acceleration  or  prepayment  and,  if
theretofore  paid,  shall be credited on the Note (or, if the Note has been paid
in full,  refunded to Borrower).  The terms and provisions of this Section shall
control and  supersede  every other  provision of the Loan  Documents.  The Loan
Documents are contracts made under and shall be construed in accordance with and
governed  by the Laws of the State,  except  that if at any time the Laws of the
United States of America permit Lender to contract for, take, reserve, charge or
receive  a higher  rate of  interest  than is  allowed  by the Laws of the State
(whether  such  federal  laws  directly  so  provide  or refer to the Law of any
state),  then such  federal  Laws shall to such extent  govern as to the rate of
interest which Lender may contract for, take,  reserve,  charge or receive under
the Loan Documents.

SECTION 1.98 INVALID  PROVISIONS.  If any provision of any Loan Document is held
to  be  illegal,  invalid  or  unenforceable,  such  provision  shall  be  fully
severable;  the  Loan  Documents  shall be  construed  and  enforced  as if such
illegal,  invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part thereof;
the  remaining  provisions  thereof shall remain in full effect and shall not be
affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance
therefrom; and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there
shall be added  automatically  as a part of such Loan  Document a  provision  as
similar in terms to such illegal,  invalid or unenforceable  provision as may be
possible to be legal, valid and enforceable.

SECTION  1.99  REIMBURSEMENT  OF  EXPENSES.  Borrower  shall pay all  reasonable
out-of-pocket  expenses of Lender in connection with  underwriting this Loan and
the preparation of the Loan Documents  (including all environmental  appraisals,
structural appraisals and travel expenses (whether or not such travel expense is
incurred by third parties or in-house staff)) and the closing and administration
of the Loan made pursuant hereto  (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
all of its counsel and advisors  retained in connection  with the Loan Documents
and the transactions  contemplated  thereby and advice in connection  therewith)
and all fees and expenses of Lender. If, at any time or times, regardless of the
existence of an Event of Default  (except with respect to paragraphs (3) and (4)
below,  which  shall be subject to an Event of Default  having  occurred  and be
continuing),  Lender shall employ  counsel or other advisors for advice or other
representation  or shall incur  reasonable  legal or other costs and expenses in
connection with:

(1)  any amendment,  modification  or waiver of, or consent with respect to, any
     of the Loan Documents or advice in connection  with the  administration  of
     the Loan made pursuant hereto or its rights hereunder or thereunder;

(2)  any  litigation,  contest,  dispute,  suit,  proceeding or action,  whether
     instituted by Lender,  Borrower or any other Person, in any way relating to
     the Properties, or any other Collateral, or any portion thereof, any of the
     Loan  Documents  or any other  agreements  to be executed or  delivered  in
     connection  herewith  (including  any lenders'  liability  claim,  contest,
     dispute, suit, proceeding or action);

(3)  any attempt to enforce any rights of Lender  against  Borrower or any other
     Person,  that may be  obligated  to  Lender  by  virtue  of any of the Loan
     Documents;

(4)  any attempt to verify,  protect,  collect,  sell,  liquidate  or  otherwise
     dispose of the Properties, or any other Collateral, or any portion thereof;

then, and in any such event, the attorneys' and other parties' fees arising from
such services,  including those of any appellate proceedings, and all reasonable
expenses,  costs,  charges and other fees incurred by such counsel and others in
any way or respect  arising in connection  with or relating to any of the events
or actions described in this Section shall be payable, on demand, by Borrower to
Lender and shall be additional  Obligations secured under this Agreement and the
other Loan  Documents.  Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  such
expenses, costs, charges and fees may include:  reasonable paralegal fees, costs
and expenses;  accountants'  and investment  bankers' fees,  costs and expenses;
court costs and expenses;  photocopying and duplicating expenses; court reporter
fees, costs and expenses;  long distance telephone charges; air express charges;
telegram charges; secretarial overtime charges; and expenses for travel, lodging
and food paid or  incurred  in  connection  with the  performance  of such legal
services.

SECTION 1.100 APPROVALS; THIRD PARTIES; CONDITIONS. All approval rights retained
or  exercised by Lender with respect to leases,  contracts,  plans,  studies and
other matters are solely to facilitate Lender's credit  underwriting,  and shall
not be deemed or  construed  as a  determination  that  Lender has passed on the
adequacy thereof for any other purpose and may not be relied upon by Borrower or
any other Person. This Agreement is for the sole and exclusive use of Lender and
Borrower  and may not be  enforced,  nor relied  upon,  by any Person other than
Lender and Borrower.  All  conditions of the  obligations  of Lender  hereunder,
including the  obligation to make Advances,  are imposed solely and  exclusively
for the benefit of Lender, its successors and assigns, and no other Person shall
have  standing  to require  satisfaction  of such  conditions  or be entitled to
assume  that  Lender  will  refuse to make  Advances  in the  absence  of strict
compliance with any or all of such conditions,  and no other Person shall, under
any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any and all
of which  may be  freely  waived  in whole or in part by  Lender  at any time in
Lender's sole discretion.

SECTION  1.101  LENDER NOT IN CONTROL;  NO  PARTNERSHIP/MEMBERSHIP.  None of the
covenants or other  provisions  contained in this Agreement  shall,  or shall be
deemed to, give Lender the right or power to exercise  control  over the affairs
or  management  of Borrower,  the power of Lender being limited to the rights to
exercise  the  remedies  referred  to in the Loan  Documents.  The  relationship
between  Borrower and Lender is, and at all times shall  remain,  solely that of
debtor and creditor. No covenant or provision of the Loan Documents is intended,
nor shall it be deemed or construed,  to create a  partnership,  joint  venture,
agency or common interest in profits or income between Lender and Borrower or to
create an equity in any  Property  in  Lender.  Lender  neither  undertakes  nor
assumes  any  responsibility  or duty to  Borrower  or to any other  person with
respect to any Property or the Loan,  except as  expressly  provided in the Loan
Documents;  and notwithstanding  any other provision of the Loan Documents:  (1)
Lender is not, and shall not be construed as, a partner,  joint venturer,  alter
ego, manager,  controlling  person or other business associate or participant of
any kind of Borrower or its stockholders,  members,  or partners and Lender does
not intend to ever assume such  status;  (2) Lender  shall in no event be liable
for any Indebtedness,  expenses or losses incurred or sustained by Borrower; and
(3) Lender shall not be deemed  responsible  for or a  participant  in any acts,
omissions or decisions of Borrower or its  stockholders,  members,  or partners.
Lender and Borrower  disclaim any  intention  to create any  partnership,  joint
venture,  agency or common  interest  in  profits or income  between  Lender and
Borrower,  or to create an equity in any  Property in Lender,  or any sharing of
liabilities, losses, costs or expenses.

SECTION  1.102 TIME OF THE ESSENCE.  Time is of the essence with respect to this
Agreement.

SECTION 1.103  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of Lender and Borrower and the  respective  successors  and
assigns of Lender and  Borrower,  provided  that neither  Borrower nor any other
Borrower Party shall,  without the prior written  consent of Lender,  assign any
rights, duties or obligations  hereunder.  Lender may sell, assign,  transfer or
negotiate to one or more other lenders,  commercial banks,  insurance companies,
other financial  institutions or any other Person  acceptable to Lender all or a
portion  of its  rights  and  obligations  under the Loan  Documents,  provided,
however, that (1) each such sale,  assignment,  transfer or negotiation shall be
of a constant,  and not a varying,  percentage of all of the assigning  Lender's
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents,  (2) any such sale, assignment,
transfer  or  negotiation  shall not  require  Borrower  to file a  registration
statement with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission or apply to qualify the
Note  under the blue sky laws of any  state,  or  otherwise  participate  in the
selling process in a manner which could give rise to liability of Borrower under
Sections  11 or 12 of the  Securities  Act of 1933 or  other  federal  or  state
securities  Laws,  (3)  acceptance  of such  assignment  by any  assignee  shall
constitute  the  agreement  of such  assignee  to be bound by the  terms of this
Agreement  applicable  to Lender,  (4) GECC shall  have the  exclusive  right to
control all  decisions  by Lender under the Loan  Documents,  and (5) such sale,
assignment or other transfer shall not result in any increased cost to Borrower.
From and  after  the  effective  date of such an  assignment,  (a) the  assignee
thereunder shall, in addition to the rights and obligations hereunder held by it
immediately  prior to such  effective  date,  have the  rights  and  obligations
hereunder that have been assigned to it pursuant to such  assignment and (b) the
assignor  Lender  thereunder  shall,  to the extent that rights and  obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such  assignment,  relinquish its
rights and be released from its  obligations  under this Agreement  (and, in the
case of an assignment and acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
assigning  Lender's  rights and obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender
shall  cease to be a party  hereto).  Borrower  agrees that it will use its best
efforts to assist and  cooperate,  at Lender's cost and expense,  with Lender in
any  manner   reasonably   requested  by  Lender  to  effect  the  sale  of  any
participation  in, or any  assignment  of, any of the Loan  Documents  or of any
portion thereof or interest therein,  including assistance in the preparation of
appropriate  disclosure  documents or placement  memoranda.  In the event Lender
assigns or otherwise  transfers all or any part of the Note in  accordance  with
the  provisions of this  Section,  Borrower  shall,  upon the request of Lender,
issue a new Note (which shall be  substantially in the same form as the Note) to
effectuate such assignment or transfer, provided that the total principal amount
of all of the Notes does not exceed the outstanding Loan balance plus the amount
of undisbursed Loan funds then available for disbursement, and the total amounts
payable  under the Notes are not greater than the amounts  payable prior to such
assignment or transfer.

SECTION 1.104 RENEWAL,  EXTENSION OR  REARRANGEMENT.  All provisions of the Loan
Documents  shall apply with equal  effect to each and all  promissory  notes and
amendments  thereof  hereinafter  executed which in whole or in part represent a
renewal,  extension,  increase  or  rearrangement  of the  Loan.  For  portfolio
management  purposes,  during the Term  Lender may elect to divide the Loan into
two or more separate loans evidenced by separate promissory notes so long as the
payment and other  obligations  of Borrower  are not  effectively  increased  or
otherwise modified. Borrower agrees to cooperate with Lender and to execute such
documents as Lender reasonably may request to effect such division of the Loan.

SECTION 1.105 WAIVERS. No course of dealing on the part of Lender, its officers,
employees,  consultants  or  agents,  nor any  failure  or delay by Lender  with
respect to exercising  any right,  power or privilege of Lender under any of the
Loan Documents,  shall operate as a waiver thereof, it being understood that any
waivers must be in writing and executed by the party giving such waiver.

SECTION 1.106  CUMULATIVE  RIGHTS.  Rights and remedies of Lender under the Loan
Documents shall be cumulative,  and the exercise or partial exercise of any such
right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy.

SECTION  1.107  CONSTRUCTION.  Words used in this  Agreement  and the other Loan
Documents  in the  singular,  where the context so  permits,  shall be deemed to
include the plural and vice versa.  The  definitions of words in the singular in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents  shall apply to such words when used
in the plural  where the context so permits and vice versa.  Any  reference to a
Schedule hereto, a Loan Document or Ancillary  Agreement shall be deemed to be a
reference  to such  Schedule,  Loan  Document or  Ancillary  Agreement as it may
hereafter  from time to time be  amended,  modified,  supplemented,  updated  or
restated in accordance  with the terms hereof.  Any accounting term used in this
Agreement shall have, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, the meaning
customarily  given  such  term  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  and  all  financial
computations hereunder shall be computed, unless otherwise specifically provided
herein,  in accordance  with GAAP  consistently  applied.  That certain terms or
computations  are explicitly  modified by the phrase "in  accordance  with GAAP"
shall in no way be construed to limit the foregoing.

SECTION 1.108 PHRASES. When used in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
the  word  "include(s)"  means  "include(s),   without   limitation,"  the  word
"including" means "including,  but not limited to," the phrase  "satisfactory to
Lender" means "in form and substance  satisfactory  to Lender in all  respects,"
the phrase  "with  Lender's  consent"  or "with  Lender's  approval"  means such
consent or  approval  at  Lender's  discretion,  and the phrase  "acceptable  to
Lender"  means  "acceptable  to Lender at Lender's sole  discretion."  The words
"herein,"  "hereof" and  "hereunder"  and other words of similar import refer to
this Agreement as a whole,  including the Exhibits and Schedules  hereto, as the
same may from time to time be amended,  modified or supplemented  and not to any
particular section, subsection or clause contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 1.109  EXHIBITS AND  SCHEDULES.  The Exhibits and Schedules  attached to
this  Agreement are  incorporated  herein and shall be considered a part of this
Agreement for the purposes stated herein.

SECTION  1.110  TITLES OF  ARTICLES,  SECTIONS  AND  SUBSECTIONS.  All titles or
headings to articles, sections, subsections or other divisions of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents or the Exhibits hereto and thereto are only for the
convenience  of the  parties  and shall not be  construed  to have any effect or
meaning  with  respect  to  the  other  content  of  such  articles,   sections,
subsections or other divisions,  such other content being  controlling as to the
agreement between the parties hereto.

SECTION 1.111  PUBLICITY.  Lender and Borrower will cooperate with respect to an
agreed-upon  press  release  and any  other  official  public  statements  to be
released  by either  of them with  respect  to the  making of the Loan.  Neither
Lender nor Borrower  shall issue or shall permit any of its  Affiliates to issue
any other press release or other official  public  statement with respect to the
making of the Loan except with the consent of the other,  provided  that nothing
contained  herein  shall  restrict  either  Lender or Borrower or any  Affiliate
thereof from making any public disclosure it reasonably  believes is required by
Law or any oral response to any press inquiry.

SECTION 1.112 SURVIVAL.  Except as otherwise  expressly provided for in the Loan
Documents, no termination or cancellation  (regardless of cause or procedure) of
any financing arrangement under this Agreement shall in any way affect or impair
the  powers,  obligations,  duties,  rights and  liabilities  of Borrower or the
rights of Lender  relating to any  transaction or event  occurring prior to such
termination.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any other Loan
Document,   all   undertakings,    agreements,    covenants,    warranties   and
representations  contained in the Loan Documents shall survive such  termination
or  cancellation  and shall continue in full force and effect until such time as
all of the  Obligations  have been paid in full in accordance  with the terms of
the  agreements  creating  such  Obligations,  at  which  time  the  same  shall
terminate.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth herein or in the
Hazardous  Substances  Indemnity  Agreement,  Lender,  Borrower and the Borrower
Parties (by executing the Joinder attached to this Agreement) specifically agree
that  the  indemnities  set  forth in  Article  4  hereof  and in the  Hazardous
Substances   Indemnity  Agreement  shall  survive  the  full  repayment  of  the
Obligations  only with respect to any claim or demand  pending or threatened for
Environmental Liabilities and Costs that is actually known to Borrower as of the
date all Obligations are satisfied.

SECTION 1.113  GOVERNING LAW. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE  EXPRESSLY  PROVIDED IN ANY OF
THE LOAN  DOCUMENTS,  IN ALL RESPECTS,  INCLUDING  ALL MATTERS OF  CONSTRUCTION,
VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE,  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OBLIGATIONS  ARISING HEREUNDER
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK  APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE,
WITHOUT REGARD TO THE  PRINCIPLES  THEREOF  REGARDING  CONFLICT OF LAWS, AND ANY
APPLICABLE  LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  LENDER AND BORROWER  AGREE TO
SUBMIT TO PERSONAL  JURISDICTION  AND TO WAIVE ANY  OBJECTION AS TO VENUE IN THE
COUNTY OF NEW YORK,  STATE OF NEW YORK.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL PRECLUDE LENDER OR
BORROWER  FROM  BRINGING  SUIT  OR  TAKING  OTHER  LEGAL  ACTION  IN  ANY  OTHER
JURISDICTION.

SECTION 1.114 ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  This  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents
embody the entire  agreement and  understanding  between Lender and Borrower and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings  between such parties relating
to the subject  matter hereof and thereof.  Accordingly,  the Loan Documents may
not be  contradicted by evidence of prior,  contemporaneous,  or subsequent oral
agreements of the parties.  There are no unwritten oral  agreements  between the
parties with  respect to the Loan  Documents  or the  transactions  contemplated
thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents by specific reference to the applicable  provisions of this Agreement,
if  any  provision   contained  in  this  Agreement  is  in  conflict  with,  or
inconsistent  with,  any  provision  in any of the  other  Loan  Documents,  the
provision contained in this Agreement shall govern and control.

SECTION  1.115  COUNTERPARTS.   This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  multiple
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which shall
constitute one document.

SECTION  1.116  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  TO THE MAXIMUM  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY LAW,
BORROWER AND LENDER HEREBY KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY AND  INTENTIONALLY  WAIVE THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION  BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION  WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENT,  OR ANY
COURSE OF CONDUCT,  COURSE OF DEALING,  STATEMENT (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR
ACTION OF ANY PARTY OR ANY  EXERCISE  BY ANY  PARTY OF THEIR  RESPECTIVE  RIGHTS
UNDER THE LOAN  DOCUMENTS  OR IN ANY WAY  RELATING  TO THE LOAN OR ANY  PROPERTY
(INCLUDING  ANY  ACTION TO RESCIND OR CANCEL  THIS  AGREEMENT,  AND ANY CLAIM OR
DEFENSE  ASSERTING THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS FRAUDULENTLY  INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE
VOID OR VOIDABLE). THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR LENDER TO ENTER THIS
AGREEMENT.

SECTION 1.117 AUTHORIZED  SIGNATURE.  Until Lender shall be notified by Borrower
to the  contrary,  the  signature  upon any  document  or  instrument  delivered
pursuant  hereto of any one (1) of the officers of WP Commercial (as the manager
of the sole member of the sole  member of  Borrower)  listed in  Schedule  11.23
hereto  (as the same may be  amended  by  notice  given  hereunder)  shall  bind
Borrower  and be deemed to be the act of  Borrower,  affixed  pursuant to and in
accordance with the Operating  Agreement and the WWG Operating Agreement and the
approval of the member(s) of Borrower and WWG.

SECTION 1.118 POWER OF ATTORNEY. Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in
any other Loan Document to the contrary,  in the exercise of any remedy pursuant
to any of the Loan Documents,  Lender shall act as a prudent lender would act in
similar  circumstances  in creating  liabilities  for,  or settling  liabilities
against Borrower pursuant to any power of attorney granted under any of the Loan
Documents.

                            LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY

SECTION  1.119  LIMITATION  ON LIABILITY.  Except as otherwise  provided  below,
Lender's  recourse shall be limited to the Collateral and no members of Borrower
or any of their Affiliates or their affiliated companies,  officers,  directors,
shareholders,  members or any other Person,  disclosed or undisclosed,  shall be
personally  liable for the repayment of any of the Obligations,  except that the
Borrower and the Borrower Parties (to the extent provided in, and subject to the
terms of, the Joinder  attached  hereto) (but not The Goldman Sachs Group,  Inc.
and not any direct or  indirect  general or limited  partners  or  shareholders,
members, officers, directors or employees of the general or limited partners in,
or members of, the Borrower Parties which are not themselves  Borrower  Parties)
shall be  personally  liable (1) for the  portion of the  outstanding  principal
balance of the Loan  allocable  to the Nomura  Properties,  as  evidenced by the
Adjusted Loan Basis for such  Properties,  and all accrued and unpaid  interest,
fees and other sums owing under the Loan Documents which are attributable to, or
otherwise  fairly allocable to, such principal  balance,  (2) for the Borrower's
fraud (but only to the extent of actual  damages  suffered  by Lender  caused by
such  fraud),  (3)  whether  prior  to or after  an  Event  of  Default  for the
Borrower's misappropriation (I.E., application in violation of the terms of this
Agreement) of insurance proceeds,  condemnation awards, Operating Cash Flow, Net
Capital Proceeds,  Lease Buy Out Consideration,  Security Deposits and any other
amounts  required  to be held by  Borrower  in  escrow  or  segregated  accounts
pursuant  to the terms  hereof and any other  escrow  deposits,  but only to the
extent of the amounts so misapplied and received by such Borrower Party, (4) for
all  Environmental  Liabilities  and  Costs to the  extent  indemnifiable  under
Article 4 hereof or under the Hazardous Substances Indemnity Agreement,  (5) for
failure to maintain any insurance  coverage required under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document  (including any insurance  coverage required with respect to
the Nomura  Properties),  (6) a breach of (i) the representations and warranties
set forth in  Section  6.18,  or (ii) the  covenants  in  Section  9.7,  as such
covenants  pertain to the Shattuck Office Center Property  (excluding,  however,
any such breach under  Section 9.7  occurring  after the Shattuck  Office Center
Property  becomes a  Property  under  this  Agreement),  and (7) for any and all
matters covered by the Indemnification Agreement. Lender agrees to look first to
the assets of  Borrower  in  connection  with the  satisfaction  of any claim or
liability  arising from Section 8.16 or this Section (except with respect to any
claim  or  liability  arising  under  clause  (7)  above,  as to  which  no such
limitation  shall apply) but Lender shall have the right to proceed  against any
Borrower  Party  with  respect  to the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs  for which  such
Borrower  Party is liable (as set forth in the  Joinder)  in the event  Borrower
disputes or denies such liability or otherwise  fails to hold Lender harmless in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.16.

SECTION 1.120 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF LENDER'S OFFICERS,  EMPLOYEES, ETC. Any
obligation  or liability  whatsoever of Lender which may arise at any time under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be satisfied,  if at all, out of
the Lender's  assets only. No such  obligation or liability  shall be personally
binding  upon,  nor shall  resort  for the  enforcement  thereof  be had to, the
property of any of Lender's  shareholders,  directors,  officers,  employees  or
agents,  regardless of whether such  obligation or liability is in the nature of
contract, tort or otherwise.

                                     JOINDER

By executing this Joinder (the "JOINDER") and as further  consideration  for the
making  of the Loan by  Lender,  each  Borrower  Party  agrees  that it shall be
personally  liable and responsible,  jointly and severally  (except as otherwise
expressly stated in this Joinder), for the obligations and liabilities for which
Borrower  is  personally  liable  under  Section  12.1  of this  Agreement  (the
"NONRECOURSE  CARVE-OUTS"),  subject  to the  limitations  set  forth  below for
certain  of the  Borrower  Parties.  This  Joinder  is a  guarantee  of full and
complete payment and performance and not of collectibility.

1.   LIMITATIONS.  The  liability  of the Borrower  Parties for the  Nonrecourse
     Carve-Outs shall be subject to the following limitations:

(1)  Each of the Whitehall  Parties and Wellsford shall be jointly and severally
     liable for  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs  described  in  clauses  (2) and (3) of
     Section  12.1,  but  shall  not be liable  for the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs
     described in clauses (1), (4), (5) and (6) of Section 12.1;

(2)  WWG shall be jointly and severally  liable for the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs
     described in clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Section 12.1;

(3)  WWPII  shall be jointly  and  severally  liable for all of the  Nonrecourse
     Carve-Outs; and

(4)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  liability  of WWG and  WWPII for the
     Nonrecourse Carve-Outs described in clauses (2) through (6) of Section 12.1
     shall be  limited,  in the  aggregate,  to:  (i) until such time all of the
     Obligations  have been  paid in full,  an amount  equal to the  greater  of
     ("MAXIMUM LIABILITY"):  (A) Thirty-Six Million Dollars  ($36,000,000),  and
     (B) fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding  principal  balance of the Loan,
     calculated as of the date Lender delivers written notice to Borrower and/or
     WWG or WWPII of the existence of a claim, and (ii) from and after such time
     as all of the  Obligations  have been paid in full,  Thirty Million Dollars
     ($30,000,000),  and in all cases the Maximum  Liability shall be reduced by
     amounts  theretofore  paid by the Borrower Parties pursuant to this Joinder
     (excluding  amounts paid by WWPII in respect of the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Out
     described in clause (1) of Section 12.1).

Nothing  contained in this Joinder or in Section 12.1 of this  Agreement  (or in
any other provision of this  Agreement)  shall in any way limit the liability of
the Whitehall Parties or Wellsford under the Indemnification Agreement.

2. THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS.  Except as expressly provided herein,  each Borrower
Party (each  referred to herein as a "THIRD  PARTY  OBLIGOR")  waives  notice of
default, presentment,  demand for payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of
nonpayment  or  dishonor,  and  all  other  notices  and  demands  of  any  kind
whatsoever;  and each Third Party  Obligor  consents and agrees that Lender may,
from  time  to  time,  without  notice  or  demand  and  without  affecting  the
enforceability of this Joinder: (a) supplement,  modify,  amend, extend,  renew,
accelerate  or  otherwise  change  the  time  for  payment  or the  terms of the
Obligations  or any part  thereof,  including  any  increase  or decrease of the
rate(s) of interest thereon; (b) supplement,  modify,  amend, or waive, or enter
into or give any agreement, approval or consent with respect to, the Obligations
or any part thereof, or any security or guaranties, or any condition,  covenant,
default, remedy, right, representation or term thereof or thereunder; (c) accept
new or  additional  instruments,  documents  or  agreements  in exchange  for or
relative to the Obligations or any part thereof;  (d) accept partial payments on
the Obligations;  (e) receive and hold additional security or guaranties for the
Obligations  or any part  thereof;  (f)  release,  reconvey,  terminate,  waive,
abandon, fail to perfect,  subordinate,  exchange,  substitute,  transfer and/or
enforce any security or guaranties,  and apply any security and direct the order
or manner of sale  thereof  as Lender in its sole and  absolute  discretion  may
determine;  (g) release any Person from any personal  liability  with respect to
the Obligations or any part thereof;  (h) settle,  release on terms satisfactory
to Lender or by operation of applicable Laws, or otherwise  liquidate or enforce
any Obligations, including any of the Nonrecourse Carve-Outs and any security or
guaranty in any manner,  consent to the  transfer of any  security,  and bid and
purchase at any sale; (i) amend, modify, waive, supplement or terminate the Loan
Agreement,  the Note or any of the other Loan Documents;  and (j) consent to the
merger,  change or any other  restructuring  or  termination of the existence of
Borrower or any other Person, and  correspondingly  restructure the Obligations,
and any such merger,  change,  restructuring or termination shall not affect the
enforceability or security hereof.

3. RIGHTS  INDEPENDENT.  Each Third Party Obligor's  obligations with respect to
the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs  are  independent  of  those  of any  other  Person
(including the other Third Party  Obligors),  and upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default  (subject to the limitations set forth in
Paragraph  1 of this  Joinder),  Lender may proceed in the  enforcement  of each
Third Party  Obligor's  obligations  independently  of any other right or remedy
that Lender may at any time hold with respect to the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs or
any  security  therefor  (except as  expressly  set forth in Paragraph 1 of this
Joinder).  Except as set forth in Section 12.1,  each Third Party Obligor waives
any right to require Lender to: (a) proceed against Borrower or any guarantor or
other Person,  including any other Third Party  Obligor  (regardless  of whether
such other Third Party  Obligor's  liability for the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs is
more or less extensive (or the same) as that of such Third Party  Obligor);  (b)
proceed against or exhaust any security for the Nonrecourse Carve-Outs; (c) give
notice of the terms, time and place of any public or private sale of any real or
personal  property  security for the Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs;  or (d) pursue any
other remedy in Lender's power whatsoever.

4. DEFERRAL OF RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
elsewhere  contained  herein or in any other  document  to which any Third Party
Obligor is a party, each Third Party Obligor hereby expressly agrees that, until
payment and  performance  in full of all  Obligations,  such Third Party Obligor
shall not  assert,  with  respect to  Borrower  and its  successors  and assigns
(including  any  surety) and any other  Person,  any and all rights at law or in
equity to subrogation,  to reimbursement,  to exoneration,  to contribution,  to
setoff or to any other rights that could accrue to a surety against a principal,
to a guarantor against a maker or obligor, to an accommodation party against the
party accommodated, or to a holder or transferee against a maker, and which such
Third Party Obligor may have or hereafter  acquire against Borrower or any other
Person  in  connection  with  or as a  result  of  such  Third  Party  Obligor's
execution,  delivery  and/or  performance  of this Joinder or any other document
relating to the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs  to which such Third Party Obligor is a
party.  Each Third Party Obligor agrees that,  until payment and  performance in
full of all  Obligations,  it shall not have or assert any such  rights  against
Borrower  or its  successors  and  assigns or any other  Person  (including  any
surety),  either  directly  or as an  attempted  setoff to any action  commenced
against  such Third  Party  Obligor by  Borrower  (as  borrower  or in any other
capacity),  Lender  or  any  other  Person.  Each  Third  Party  Obligor  hereby
acknowledges  and agrees that this waiver is  intended to benefit  Borrower  and
Lender  and shall not limit or  otherwise  affect  such  Third  Party  Obligor's
liability hereunder,  under any other document to which such Third Party Obligor
is a party, or the enforceability hereof or thereof.

5.  CONDITION OF BORROWER.  Each Third Party Obligor  represents and warrants to
Lender that: (a) this Joinder is being  separately  executed by such Third Party
Obligor at Borrower's request;  and (b) such Third Party Obligor has established
adequate  means of obtaining from Borrower on a continuing  basis  financial and
other information pertaining to Borrower's businesses.  Each Third Party Obligor
hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of Lender to disclose to any
matter,  fact or thing  relating to the  business,  operation  or  condition  of
Borrower and its assets now known or hereafter  known by Lender  during the life
of the Loan Agreement. With respect to any Obligations,  Lender need not inquire
into the  power of  Borrower  or the  officers,  partners  or  agents  acting or
purporting to act on its behalf.

6. DEED OF TRUST ON REAL PROPERTY.  Each Third Party Obligor  acknowledges  that
all or a portion of the  Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs  is or may be secured by one or
more  deed(s) of trust and/or  mortgage(s)  covering  certain  interests in real
property.  Each Third  Party  Obligor  authorizes  Lender,  at its sole  option,
without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of such Third Party
Obligor for the Nonrecourse  Carve-Outs,  to foreclose any or all of the deed(s)
of trust and/or  mortgage(s) and the interests in real property  secured thereby
by  nonjudicial  sale,  or to exercise any other right or remedy with respect to
the deed(s) of trust and/or mortgage(s) or the property covered thereby. No such
action by Lender shall release or limit the liability of any Third Party Obligor
for the Nonrecourse Carve-Outs,  even if the effect of that action is to deprive
Third Party  Obligors of the right to  reimbursement  from Borrower for any sums
paid  by  Third  Party  Obligors  to  Lender  with  respect  to the  Nonrecourse
Carve-outs.  Each Third Party Obligor  waives any right to receive notice of any
judicial or nonjudicial  sale or foreclosure of any real property subject to any
deed of trust or mortgage securing the Nonrecourse Carve-Outs and the failure of
any Third Party  Obligor to receive  any such notice  shall not impair or affect
any Third Party Obligor's liability hereunder.

7.  LIMITATION  REGARDING  WAIVERS.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary
contained in this  Joinder,  Third Party  Obligors do not waive,  and each shall
retain  the right to raise,  defenses  or rights of setoff  that would have been
available to such Third Party  Obligor had it been named as a  "Borrower"  under
the Loan Agreement, other than any defenses available to the Borrower based upon
any applicable  anti-deficiency laws or "one form of action" or "security first"
laws (the  benefits  and  protections  of which are waived by each  Third  Party
Obligor).

8.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  TO THE  MAXIMUM  EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY LAW,  BORROWER
PARTIES HEREBY  KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY AND  INTENTIONALLY  WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS JOINDER, THE LOAN AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT,  OR
ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING,  STATEMENT (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN)
OR ACTION OF ANY PARTY OR ANY EXERCISE BY ANY PARTY OF THEIR  RESPECTIVE  RIGHTS
UNDER THE LOAN  DOCUMENTS  OR IN ANY WAY  RELATING  TO THE LOAN OR ANY  PROPERTY
(INCLUDING  ANY  ACTION TO  RESCIND  OR CANCEL  THIS  JOINDER  AND/OR  THIS LOAN
AGREEMENT  AND ANY CLAIM OR  DEFENSE  ASSERTING  THAT THIS  JOINDER  OR THE LOAN
AGREEMENT  WAS  FRAUDULENTLY  INDUCED OR IS OTHERWISE  VOID OR  VOIDABLE).  THIS
WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR LENDER TO ENTER THIS LOAN AGREEMENT.

               PART B - GENERAL CONDITIONS TO SUBSEQUENT ADVANCES

In addition to the specific conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement for

a condition for subsequent Advances.

58.  There shall exist no Potential  Default and no Event of Default  (currently
and after giving  effect to the  requested  Advance);  provided  that (a) if the
Advance is a Working Capital Advance,  then the foregoing  requirement regarding
Potential Defaults shall apply only to monetary Potential  Defaults,  and (b) if
the  Advance  is from  one of the  Holdbacks,  then  the  foregoing  requirement
regarding Potential Defaults shall apply only to monetary Potential Defaults and
those  nonmonetary  Potential  Defaults for which Lender has delivered notice to
Borrower under Section 10.1(2) and which Lender reasonably determined would have
a Material Adverse Effect.

59. The representations  and warranties  contained in this Loan Agreement and in
all other Loan  Documents  are true and correct  (other than with respect to the
representations  that are given to the  knowledge  of  Borrower,  as to which no
further  representation shall be deemed given) on and as of the Closing Date and
as of the date of the requested  Advance  (I.E.,  the  representations  shall be
updated as of such dates  rather  than  restated  at such time as of the Closing
Date, except that no such update shall be required if the matter to be disclosed
would  not  have  a  Material   Adverse   Effect),   other  than   breaches   of
representations  or warranties  for which Lender has remedies under Section 8.17
so long as Borrower is performing its obligations thereunder.

60. The requested  Advance shall be secured by the Loan Documents,  subject only
to Permitted Encumbrances and to those exceptions to title approved by Lender at
the  time  of  Loan  closing,  provided  that  if the  Title  Policies  and  the
endorsements  originally  issued  thereto  do not  insure  the  priority  of the
requested  Advance as required herein,  such priority shall be evidenced by such
additional endorsements to each Title Policy as are satisfactory to Lender.

61. If the Adjusted Loan Basis for a Property is being  increased to reflect the
requested Advance, or a portion thereof (if the Advance relates to more than one
Property),   Borrower  shall  have  provided  Lender  with  evidence  reasonably
satisfactory  to  Lender  that the  interest  rate cap  agreement  covering  the
Adjusted  Loan Basis of such  Property has been amended to increase the notional
amount  thereunder to an amount equal to the  increased  Adjusted Loan Basis for
such Property.

62.  Borrower  shall  have  paid  Lender's  reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs and
expenses in connection with such advance (including title and recording charges,
taxes and filing fees and costs and expenses of Lender's inspecting engineer and
attorneys).

63. A certification  from the manager or a duly authorized  officer of Borrower,
certifying that there have been (a) no additional building improvements,  and no
expansion  of  existing  building  improvements,  at  any  Property,  except  as
previously  approved by Lender or otherwise not prohibited under this Agreement,
and (b) no other  changes,  alterations  or  improvements  to any Property which
would cause a Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Property.

64. If the Adjusted Loan Basis for any Property is being adjusted to reflect the
Advance,  Borrower  shall have amended any applicable  Collateral  Document that
contains a maximum indebtedness  provision that is based upon such Adjusted Loan
Basis to increase such maximum indebtedness, if it is not already equal, to 120%
of the Adjusted Loan Basis  calculated  after such Advance,  and Borrower  shall
have paid all additional mortgage recording taxes which may be due on account of
such  reallocation  and all  recording  charges  and  filing  fees  incurred  in
connection with recording any amended Collateral Documents.

The  acceptance  by Borrower of the  proceeds of any Advance  shall be deemed to
constitute, as of the date of such acceptance, a confirmation by Borrower of the
granting and continuance of Lender's Liens pursuant to the Collateral Documents.

                        PART C - WORKING CAPITAL ADVANCES

In  addition to the  applicable  terms and  conditions  set forth in Section 2.1
hereof,  and the  general  conditions  set forth in Part B above,  each  Working

and/or  confirmation of the following,  at Borrower's cost and expense,  each in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender:

65. Lender shall have approved the Working  Capital  Budget for the Property for
which the Working Capital Advance is requested.

officer of Borrower stating that:

(2)  the sum requested is justly  required to reimburse  Borrower (or the Nomura
     Borrower)  for  payments by  Borrower  (or the Nomura  Borrower)  to, or is
     justly  due to,  the  contractor,  subcontractors,  materialmen,  laborers,
     engineers,  architects  or other  persons  rendering  services or supplying
     materials  in  connection  with  such  Capital   Expenditures   and  Tenant
     Improvements  (giving a brief  description of such services and materials),
     and that when added to all sums previously paid out by Lender,  if any, the
     resulting  sum does not exceed the value of the such  Capital  Expenditures
     and Tenant Improvements done to the date of such certificate; and

(3)  with  respect to the  certificate  of the manager or an officer of Borrower
     only, the amount of the requested  Working Capital Advance (as allocated to
     such  Property)  will be sufficient  (together  with other funds  otherwise
     available to  Borrower) on  completion  of such  Capital  Expenditures  and
     Tenant  Improvements to pay for the same in full (giving in such reasonable
     detail as Lender may require an estimate of the cost of such completion and
     if such other funds are required as to the sources of such funds).

70. With  respect to Capital  Expenditures  or Tenant  Improvements  the cost of
which (in the aggregate with respect to the completion of the entire project) is
or is estimated to equal or exceed $150,000:

     that part of such Capital  Expenditures and Tenant Improvements  previously
     paid for, if any;

     wetlands,  coastal or other rules,  regulations,  ordinances,  statutes and
     requirements applicable thereto;

(5)  Lender  shall  retain an amount  equal to 10% of the cost to  perform  such
     Capital  Expenditures,  until delivery of acceptable  final lien waivers or
     releases from all contractors performing such Capital Expenditures; and

(6)  Lender  shall  retain an amount  equal to 10% of the cost to  perform  such
     Tenant Improvements until Lender receives delivery of acceptable final lien
     waivers  or  releases   from  all   contractors   performing   such  Tenant
     Improvements.

71.  As to  Tenant  Improvements  in  which  the cost in the  aggregate  for the

the Leasing Cost then due and payable as provided in the  immediately  preceding
sentence.

Tenant Improvements for any Lease shall not exceed (i) $4.00 per square foot for
each year of the initial Lease term not subject to a Tenant termination right or
option, up to 5 years (plus $1.00 per square foot for each  non-terminable  year
of the  initial  term of such Lease in excess of 5 years,  up to a maximum of an
additional  $5.00) for space which has been previously  leased by the current or
any prior  Tenant,  and (ii) $5.00 per square  foot for each year of the initial
Lease term not subject to a Tenant  termination  right or option,  up to 5 years
(plus $1.00 per square foot for each  non-terminable year of the initial term of
such  Lease in excess of 5 years,  up to a maximum of an  additional  $5.00) for
space which has not been previously  leased by the Tenant under such Lease or by
a prior Tenant;  (b) the aggregate  amount of Working  Capital  Advances for any
Leasing  Costs  shall  not  exceed  7.0% of the  total  rent  payable  under the

and Leasing  Costs for any single Lease exceeds  $600,000.00,  Lender shall have
the right to  approve  such  Lease  prior to making  any such  advance;  (d) any
remaining balance of the Lease Buy Out  Consideration  with respect to the space
for which the Tenant Improvement will be constructed,  shall be used by Borrower
for such Tenant  Improvement  prior to using or requesting  any Working  Capital
Advance  therefor.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the  limitations for Tenant
Improvements  and Leasing Costs set forth in the immediately  preceding  clauses
(a) and (b)  respectively  may be reasonably  increased to such amount as may be
requested by Borrower, provided that Borrower is able to demonstrate to Lender's
reasonable  satisfaction  that the  increased  amount  requested  by Borrower is
consistent with the market in the relevant geographic market.

Tenant  Improvements,  Leasing  Costs or Capital  Expenditures,  shall have been

rental  rate in any one year of not  less  than  eighty  percent  of the  annual
average rental for the entire term thereof,  provided that if the Lease provides
for any free rent  during  the first year of its term  (which in no event  shall
exceed six (6) months of free  rent),  then no income  from such Lease  shall be
included in calculating  Adjusted Operating Cash Flow for any purpose under this
Agreement until the free rent period has expired and the Tenant commences paying
rent;  (d) shall  provide  with  respect to Leases which are not triple net, for
base year  operating  expense  stops for purposes of  calculating  each Tenant's
operating  expense  escalation  for each Property  which are, in the  aggregate,
equal to then current  operating  expenses for such  Property  plus or minus ten
percent  (10%);  and (e) if the Tenant has the right or option to terminate  the
Lease prior to its stated  expiration  date,  either (i) the Lease shall provide
that such Tenant shall  reimburse  Borrower for the  unamortized  cost of Tenant
Improvements  and Leasing  Costs paid for by Borrower,  or (ii) the total amount
advanced  for Tenant  Improvements  and Leasing  Costs with respect to the Lease
pursuant to paragraph 11 above shall be calculated assuming the Lease terminated
on the first date on which the  Tenant  could  exercise  such right or option to
terminate.

77. With respect to any funding to be advanced for Capital  Expenditures,  in no
event shall the Working  Capital  Advances  with respect to any single  Property
exceed (in the  aggregate for all Capital  Expenditures  made in respect of such
Property) the total amount of Loan funds  allocated to Capital  Expenditures  in
the  approved  Working  Capital  Budget for such  Property.  In no event shall a
Working Capital Advance for Capital Expenditures, Tenant Improvements or Leasing
Costs be  available  for Work or Major  Work  required  in  connection  with any
casualty or condemnation.

78. With respect to Capital Expenditures and Tenant Improvements, Borrower shall
have delivered to Lender, to the extent not previously delivered to Lender:

(1)  if the cost thereof is equal to or greater than  $150,000,  complete  plans
     and  specifications for such Capital  Expenditures and Tenant  Improvements
     (approved by all  Governmental  Authorities  whose  approval is required at
     such time), for Lender's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
     withheld or delayed,  which plans and specifications  shall bear the signed
     approval   thereof  by  an  Architect  and  shall  be  accompanied  by  the
     Architect's  signed estimate,  bearing the Architect's  seal, of the entire
     cost of completing such Capital Expenditures and Tenant Improvements;

(2)  certified or  photostatic  copies of all permits and approvals  required by
     Law  in  connection  with  the   commencement   and  conduct  such  Capital

     by  Lender,  a payment  and  performance  bond for and/or  guaranty  of the
     payment  for  and  completion  of  such  Capital  Expenditures  and  Tenant
     Improvements,   which  bond  or  guaranty  shall  be  in  form   reasonably
     satisfactory  to Lender,  and shall be signed by a surety or  sureties,  or
     guarantor or guarantors,  as the case may be, who are reasonably acceptable
     to  Lender,  and shall be in an amount  of not less  than one  hundred  ten
     percent (110%) of the Architect's estimate of the entire cost of completing
     such Capital Expenditures and Tenant Improvements;  provided, however, that
     no such  performance  bond or guaranty  shall be  required if Borrower  has
     completed and paid for such Capital Expenditures or Tenant Improvements and
     is seeking a Loan disbursement to reimburse Borrower for such costs.

                           PART D - HOLDBACK ADVANCES

Re:  Deposit Account - Wellsford/Whitehall Holdings, L.L.C. ("CUSTOMER")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     At the request and instruction of Customer, we confirm to you that Customer
maintains with us at our offices at  _________________________,  ______________,
New    York,    an    Account    No.     ___________     in    the    name    of
"___________________________________________"  (the "DEPOSIT ACCOUNT"). Customer
may not make  any  withdrawals  from  this  Deposit  Account,  except  as may be
provided below.  The aggregate amount on deposit in the Deposit Account shall be
referred to as the "DEPOSITS".

     In addition we acknowledge and agree as follows:

     (1) Customer has notified us that it has pledged and assigned its rights in
the Deposit  Account  and the  Deposits  to Lender as  security  for  Customer's
obligations  under that certain Loan Agreement between Lender and Customer dated
June ___, 2001.

     (2) The Deposit  Account has been  established  and will be  maintained  to
allow  withdrawals  by  Customer  alone  until  one  business  day after we have
received notice (in accordance  with the notice  provision set forth below) from
Lender that an Event of Default has  occurred  with  respect to the  obligations
secured by the Account, after which withdrawals may be made only by Lender or as
Lender expressly  instructs us in writing.  We will be fully protected in acting
on any  instructions  signed by the Lender regarding the Deposit Account without
making  any  inquiry  as  to  the  Lender's  right  or  authority  to  give  the
instructions or as to the application of any payment made pursuant thereto,  and
any payment of all or part of the Deposit Account made to the Lender or pursuant
to  instructions  received on Lender's  letterhead will satisfy any liability we
have to the  Lender,  and  relieve us of all  liability  to the  Customer,  with
respect to such payment.

     (3) We retain  the right to debit the  Deposit  Account at any time for (i)
the amount of any  overdraft in the Account,  (ii) the amount of any  electronic
credit or paper item deposited to the Deposit Account and subsequently  reversed
or returned  for any reason,  and (iii) the amount of all service fees and other
charges  associated  with the  Deposit  Account  (collectively,  the  "PERMITTED
DEBITS").  If we are  unable  to debit the  Deposit  Account  of if the  Deposit
Account contains  insufficient  available  balances at the time of any attempted
Permitted Debit, Customer agrees to promptly reimburse us for the face amount of
the Permitted Debit.

     (4) This  agreement  shall be  effective  upon our receipt of an  original,
executed counterpart of this agreement.

     We hereby  confirm to you that we have not received any notice of any other
lien,  pledge,  charge assignment,  attachment,  claim or other encumbrance with
respect  to  Customer's  rights in the  Deposit  Account  or the  Deposits.  Our
responsibilities  under this  agreement  pertain to the Deposit  Account and all
funds on deposit in the Deposit  Account.  We do not  represent  or warrant that
Lender's lien is valid or enforceable.

     In  furtherance  of the pledge and  assignment of Customer's  rights in the
Deposit  Account and the  Deposits in your favor,  we agree that we will execute
such  further  documents  as you may  reasonably  request  at your sole cost and
expense with respect to such pledge and  assignment.  Lender's rights under this
agreement may be assigned only if the assignee  agrees to assume all obligations
of the assignor.

     By its signature  below,  Customer agrees to indemnify and hold us harmless
from and against  all claims,  expenses,  liabilities  or damages  that we shall
incur or suffer by reason of our entry into or  performance  of this  agreement,
except for the undersigned's  failure to exercise  reasonable care in accordance
with such practices as depository institutions would follow in the normal course
of their  business with respect to this  agreement and Deposit  Account.  To the
maximum  extent   permitted  by  law  we  will  not  be  liable  for  events  or
circumstances  beyond our reasonable  control. IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR
ANY INDIRECT DAMAGES,  LOST PROFITS,  SPECIAL PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES
WHICH  ARISE OUT OF OR IN  CONNECTION  WITH THE  SERVICES  CONTEMPLATED  BY THIS
AGREEMENT WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE (WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE
ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY  OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES.) The  provisions of this
paragraph will survive termination of this agreement.

     Customer's  tax  identification   number  for  tax  reporting  purposes  is
13-3962862, and Customer agrees that it shall treat all income, gains and losses
from amounts in the Deposit  Account as its income or loss for Federal and State
income tax purposes.

     Nothing  in  this  agreement  requires  that  we  act in  violation  of any
applicable laws, any court order, or the instructions of any bankruptcy trustee.

     Notices may be delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
overnight or local delivery  courier.  All notices provided under this agreement
will be  effective  when  actually  received  by the  addressee,  except for fax

not be  contradicted by evidence of prior,  contemporaneous,  or subsequent oral
agreements of the parties.  We are not bound by any provisions  contained in any
other document  executed between the Customer and the Lender and to which we are
not a party, even if we have been provided with a copy of that document.

     None of the provisions in this agreement  limits our rights under any other
agreement between us and the Lender,  including any  participation  agreement or
participation  certificate.  If we  participate  in the  loan  facility  between
Customer and Lender,  nothing in this  agreement will limit our right to receive
our pro-rata share of any amounts to which we are entitled.

     This letter  agreement  shall  remain in full force and effect until (a) we
have received notice from you that this agreement has been terminated, or (b) 30
days after you have received  written notice from us that we are terminating our
obligations under this agreement. Additionally, we may terminate with 5 business
days prior written  notice if either of you or the Customer fails to comply with
this agreement.

     Except as modified by this  agreement,  the Deposit Account remains subject
to our Terms and  Conditions  of  Deposit  Accounts,  and,  if  applicable,  our
Treasury Solutions Service Agreement, however, we agree that except as otherwise
provided in this agreement,  we shall have no right of set-off against any funds
in the Deposit Account and hereby waive any such rights, until this agreement is
terminated.

     This agreement which relates solely to our duties shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
