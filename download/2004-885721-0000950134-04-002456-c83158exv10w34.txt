and shall no longer be due under the Swing Line Note of Swing Line Lender but
shall instead constitute part of Swing Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans
and shall be due under the Revolving Note of Swing Line Lender. Company hereby
authorizes Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender to charge Company's
accounts with Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender (up to the amount
available in each such account) in order to immediately pay Swing Line Lender
the amount of the Refunded Swing Line Loans to the extent the proceeds of such
Revolving Loans made by Revolving Lenders, including the Revolving Loan deemed
to be made by Swing Line Lender, are not sufficient to repay in full the
Refunded Swing Line Loans. If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to
be paid) to Swing Line Lender should be recovered by or on behalf of Company
from Swing Line Lender in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors
or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among
all Revolving Lenders in the manner contemplated by subsection 10.5.

                  If for any reason (a) Revolving Loans are not made upon the
request of Swing Line Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph
in an amount sufficient to repay any amounts owed to Swing Line Lender in
respect of any outstanding Swing Line Loans or (b) the Revolving Loan
Commitments are terminated at a time when any Swing Line Loans are outstanding,
each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have purchased a
participation in such outstanding Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Pro
Rata Share (calculated, in the case of the foregoing clause (b), immediately
prior to such termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments) of the unpaid
amount of such Swing Line Loans together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one
Business Day's notice from Swing Line Lender, each Revolving Lender shall
deliver to Swing Line Lender an amount equal to its respective participation in
same day funds at the Funding and Payment Office. In order to further evidence
such participation (and without prejudice to the effectiveness of the
participation provisions set forth above), each Revolving Lender agrees to enter
into a separate participation agreement at the request of Swing Line Lender in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Swing Line Lender. In the event
any Revolving Lender fails to make available to Swing Line Lender the amount of
such Revolving Lender's participation as provided in this paragraph, Swing Line
Lender shall be enti-

                                      -30-

tled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with
interest thereon at the rate customarily used by Swing Line Lender for the
correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the
Alternate Base Rate. In the event Swing Line Lender receives a payment of any
amount in which other Revolving Lenders have purchased participations as
provided in this paragraph, Swing Line Lender shall promptly distribute to each
such other Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment.

                  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans for the purpose of
repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans pursuant to the second preceding
paragraph and each Revolving Lender's obligation to purchase a participation in
any unpaid Swing Line Loans pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph
shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
other right which such Revolving Lender may have against Swing Line Lender,
Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or
continuation of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default; (c) any
adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (d)
any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any party thereto; or
(e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; provided that such obligations of each
Revolving Lender are subject to the condition that (X) Swing Line Lender
believed in good faith that all conditions under Section 4 to the making of the
applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans, as the
case may be, were satisfied at the time such Refunded Swing Line Loans or unpaid
Swing Line Loans were made or (Y) the satisfaction of any such condition not
satisfied had been waived in accordance with subsection 10.6 prior to or at the
time such Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans were made.

                  B.       Borrowing Mechanics. Term Loans or Revolving Loans
made on any Funding Date (other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to a request
by Swing Line Lender pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iii) for the purpose of
repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans or Revolving Loans made pursuant to
subsection 3.3B for the purpose of reimbursing any Issuing Lender for the amount
of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it) shall be in an aggregate
minimum amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of
that amount. Swing Line Loans made on any Funding Date shall be in an aggregate
minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that
amount. Whenever Company desires that Lenders make Term Loans or Revolving Loans
it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing no later than
12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least three Eurodollar Business Days in
advance of the proposed Funding Date (in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan) or
at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in the case
of an Alternate Base Rate Loan); provided that, any such notice delivered with
respect to Loans requested to be made on the Closing Date may be delivered at
any time prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least one Business Day in
advance of the Closing Date. Whenever Company desires that Swing Line Lender
make a Swing Line Loan, it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of
Borrowing no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the proposed Funding

<PAGE>

                                      -31-

Date. The Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the proposed Funding Date (which
shall be a Business Day), (ii) the amount and type of Loans requested, (iii) in
the case of Swing Line Loans, that such Loans shall be an Alternate Base Rate
Loans, (iv) in the case of Term Loans and Revolving Loans, whether such Loans
shall be Alternate Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans; provided, that
Tranche A Term Loans and Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date shall be
Alternate Base Rate Loans; provided, however, on such a Funding Date Company may
request such Loans be converted to Eurodollar Rate Loans in the manner provided
in subsection 2.2D; and (v) in the case of any Loans requested to be made as
Eurodollar Rate Loans, the initial Interest Period requested therefor. Term
Loans and Revolving Loans may be continued as or converted into Alternate Base
Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans in the manner provided in subsection 2.2D.
In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of Borrowing, Company may give
Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed
borrowing under this subsection 2.1B; provided that such notice shall be
promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a Notice of Borrowing to
Administrative Agent on or before the applicable Funding Date.

                  Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any
liability to Company in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that
Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly
authorized officer or other person authorized to borrow on behalf of Company or
for otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.1B, and upon funding
of Loans by Lenders in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such
telephonic notice Company shall have effected Loans hereunder.

                  Company shall notify Administrative Agent prior to the funding
of any Loans in the event that any of the matters to which Company is required
to certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing is no longer true and correct
as of the applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by Company of the proceeds
of any Loans shall constitute a re-certification by Company, as of the
applicable Funding Date, as to the matters to which Company is required to
certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.

                  Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and
2.6G, a Notice of Borrowing for a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in
lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate
Determination Date, and Company shall be bound to make a borrowing in accordance
therewith.

                  C.       Disbursement of Funds. All Term Loans and Revolving
Loans under this Agreement shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and
proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no
Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in that other
Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder nor shall the Commitment
of any Lender to make the particular type of Loan requested be increased or
decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that other Lender's
obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder. Promptly after receipt by
Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to subsection 2.1B (or
telephonic notice in lieu thereof), Administrative Agent shall no-

<PAGE>

                                      -32-

tify each Lender or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, of the proposed
borrowing. Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
applicable Funding Date, and Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of its
Swing Line Loan available to Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the applicable Funding Date, in each case in same day funds
in Dollars, at the Funding and Payment Office. Except as provided in subsection
2.1A(iii) or subsection 3.3B with respect to Revolving Loans used to repay
Refunded Swing Line Loans or to reimburse any Issuing Lender for the amount of a
drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, upon satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions precedent specified in subsections 4.1 (in the case of Loans made
on the Closing Date) and 4.2 (in the case of all Loans), Administrative Agent
shall make the proceeds of such Loans available to Company on the applicable
Funding Date by causing an amount of same day funds in Dollars equal to the
proceeds of all such Loans received by Administrative Agent from Lenders or
Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, to be credited to the account of Company
at the Funding and Payment Office.

                  Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any
Lender prior to the Funding Date for any Loans that such Lender does not intend
to make available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Loan
requested on such Funding Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such amount available to Administrative Agent on such Funding Date and
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Company a corresponding amount on such Funding Date. If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by
such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to
Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the
correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the
Alternate Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount
within three Business Days after such amount should have been made available,
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Company and Company shall immediately
pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent together with interest
thereon, for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid
to Administrative Agent, at the rate payable under this Agreement for Alternate
Base Rate Loans. Nothing in this subsection 2.1C shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments hereunder or to prejudice
any rights that Company may have against any Lender as a result of any default
by such Lender hereunder.

                  D.       The Register.

                  (i)      Administrative Agent shall maintain, at its address
referred to in subsection 10.8, a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of Lenders and the Commitments and Loans of each Lender from time to
time (the "Register"). The Register shall be available for inspection by Company
or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

<PAGE>

                                      -33-

                  (ii)     Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the
Tranche A Commitment and Tranche B Commitment, respectively, and the Tranche A
Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan, respectively, of each Term Lender, the
Revolving Loan Commitment and the Revolving Loans from time to time of each
Revolving Lender, the Swing Line Loan Commitment and the Swing Line Loans from
time to time of Swing Line Lender, and each repayment or prepayment in respect
of the principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan,
respectively, of each Term Lender, the Revolving Loans of each Revolving Lender
or the Swing Line Loans of Swing Line Lender. Any such recordation shall be
conclusive and binding on Company and each Lender, absent manifest error;
provided that failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such
recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Company's Obligations
in respect of any applicable Loans.

                  (iii)    Each Lender shall record on its internal records
(including any Notes held by such Lender) the amount of the Tranche A Term Loan
and the Tranche B Term Loan, respectively, and each Revolving Loan made by it
and each payment in respect thereof. Any such recordation shall be conclusive
and binding on Company, absent manifest error; provided that failure to make any
such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any
Lender's Commitments or Company's Obligations in respect of any applicable
Loans; and provided, further, that in the event of any inconsistency between the
Register and any Lender's records, the recordations in the Register shall
govern.

                  (iv)     Company, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall deem
and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders and
owners of the corresponding Commitments and Loans listed therein for all
purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Commitment or Loan
shall be effective, in each case unless and until an Assignment Agreement
effecting the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by
Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register as provided in subsection
10.1B(ii). Prior to such recordation, all amounts owed with respect to the
applicable Commitment or Loan shall be owed to the Lender listed in the Register
as the owner thereof, and any request, authority or consent of any Person who,
at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is
listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding Commitments or
Loans.

                  (v)      Company hereby designates CSFB to serve as Company's
agent solely for purposes of maintaining the Register as provided in this
subsection 2.1D, and Company hereby agrees that, to the extent CSFB serves in
such capacity, CSFB and its officers, directors, employees, agents and
affiliates shall constitute Indemnitees for all purposes under subsection 10.3.

                  E.       Notes. At the request of any Lender, Company shall
execute and deliver to that Lender (or to Administrative Agent for that Lender)
each of the following, as appropriate: (i) a Tranche A Term Note substantially
in the form of Exhibit IV-A annexed hereto to evidence that Lender's Tranche A
Term Loan, in the principal amount of that Lender's Tranche A Term Loan and with
other appropriate insertions, and a Tranche B Term Note substantially in the
form

<PAGE>

                                      -34-

of Exhibit IV-B annexed hereto to evidence that Lender's Tranche B Term Loan, in
the principal amount of that Lender's Tranche B Term Loan and with other
appropriate insertions, (ii) a Revolving Note substantially in the form of
Exhibit V annexed hereto to evidence that Lender's Revolving Loans, in the
principal amount of that Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment and with other
appropriate insertions, and (iii) a Swing Line Note substantially in the form of
Exhibit VI annexed hereto to evidence that Lender's Swing Line Loans, in the
principal amount of the Swing Line Loan Commitment and with other appropriate
insertions. In the event a Lender requests such Notes at least 3 Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Company shall execute and deliver the Notes on such
date.

                  2.2.     Interest on the Loans

                  A.       Rate of Interest. Subject to the provisions of
subsections 2.6 and 2.7, each Term Loan and each Revolving Loan shall bear
interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate or the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate. Subject to
the provisions of subsection 2.7, each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on
the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through maturity (whether
by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate. The applicable basis for determining the rate of interest with
respect to any Term Loans or any Revolving Loan shall be selected by Company
initially at the time a Notice of Borrowing is given with respect to such Loans
pursuant to subsection 2.1B, and the basis for determining the interest rate
with respect to any Term Loans or any Revolving Loan may be changed from time to
time pursuant to subsection 2.2D. If on any day a Tranche A Term Loan, Tranche B
Term Loan or Revolving Loan is outstanding with respect to which notice has not
been delivered to Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement specifying the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest,
then for that day that Loan shall bear interest determined by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate. Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E and 2.7, the
Term Loans and the Revolving Loans shall bear interest through maturity as
follows:

                  (i)      if an Alternate Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of
         the Alternate Base Rate and the applicable Base Rate Margin set forth
         in the table below opposite the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the
         four-Fiscal Quarter period ending on the date for which the applicable

                  Upon delivery of the Compliance Certificate by Company to
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 6.1(iii), the applicable Base Rate
Margin and Eurodollar Rate Margin shall automatically be adjusted in accordance
with such Compliance Certificate, such adjustment to become effective on the
next succeeding Business Day following receipt by Administrative Agent of such
Compliance Certificate; provided, that if at any time a Compliance Certificate
is not delivered at the time required pursuant to subsection 6.1(iii), from the
time such Compliance Certificate was required to be delivered until delivery of
such Compliance Certificate, such applicable Base Rate Margin and Eurodollar
Rate Margin shall be the maximum percentage amount until such Compliance
Certificate is delivered.

                  Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.2E and 2.7, any
Swing Line Loans provided to Company shall bear interest through maturity at the
rate then applicable to Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.2A(i).

                  B.       Interest Periods. In connection with each Eurodollar
Rate Loan, Company may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice
of Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an interest period (each
an "Interest Period") to be applicable to such Loan, which Interest Period shall
be, at Company's option, either a seven day, 14 day, or one, two, three or six
month period or, if deposits in the interbank Eurodollar market are available to
all Lenders for such period (as determined by each Lender), a nine or twelve
month period; provided that:

                  (i)      the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate
         Loan shall commence on the Funding Date in respect of such Loan, in the
         case of a Loan initially made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on the date
         specified in the applicable Notice of Conversion/Continuation, in the
         case of a Loan converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan;

                  (ii)     in the case of immediately successive Interest
         Periods applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan continued as such pursuant
         to a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, each successive Interest Period
         shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period
         expires;

                  (iii)    if an Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
         that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the
         next succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any Interest Period
         would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day
         of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,
         such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

                  (iv)     any Interest Period that begins on the last Business
         Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically
         corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest
         Period) shall, subject to clause (v) of this subsection 2.2B, end on
         the last Business Day of a calendar month;

<PAGE>

                                      -37-

                  (v)      no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
         Tranche A Term Loans shall extend beyond the Tranche A Maturity Date,
         no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the Tranche B Term
         Loans shall extend beyond the Tranche B Maturity Date, and no Interest
         Period with respect to any portion of the Revolving Loans shall extend
         beyond the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date;

                  (vi)     no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
         Term Loans shall extend beyond a date on which Company is required to
         make a scheduled payment of principal of such Term Loans unless the sum
         of (a) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans of the type to be
         repaid that are Alternate Base Rate Loans plus (b) the aggregate
         principal amount of Term Loans of the type to be repaid that are
         Eurodollar Rate Loans with Interest Periods expiring on or before such
         date equals or exceeds the principal amount required to be paid on the
         Term Loans of such type on such date;

                  (vii)    there shall be no more than 15 Interest Periods
         outstanding at any time; and

                  (viii)   in the event Company fails to specify an Interest
         Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan in the applicable Notice of
         Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Company shall be deemed
         to have selected an Interest Period of one month.

                  C.       Interest Payments. Subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.2E, interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to
each Interest Payment Date applicable to that Loan, upon any prepayment of that
Loan (to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) and at maturity
(including final maturity); provided that in the event any Swing Line Loans or
any Revolving Loans that are Alternate Base Rate Loans are prepaid pursuant to
subsection 2.4B(i), interest accrued on such Swing Line Loans or Revolving Loans
through the date of such prepayment shall be payable on the next succeeding
Interest Payment Date applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans (or, if earlier,
at final maturity).

                  D.       Conversion or Continuation. Subject to the provisions
of subsection 2.6, Company shall have the option (i) to convert at any time all
or any part of its outstanding Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or
Revolving Loans equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in
excess of that amount from Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by
reference to one basis to Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by
reference to an alternative basis or (ii) upon the expiration of any Interest
Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, to continue all or any portion of
such Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of
that amount as a Eurodollar Rate Loan; provided, however, that a Eurodollar Rate
Loan may only be converted into a Alternate Base Rate Loan on the expiration
date of an Interest Period applicable thereto.

                  Company shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to
Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least one
Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a
conversion to an Alternate Base Rate Loan) and at

<PAGE>

                                      -38-

least three Eurodollar Business Days in advance of the proposed
conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation
of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). A Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall specify
(i) the proposed conversion/continuation date (which shall be a Business Day),
(ii) the amount and type of the Loan to be converted/continued, (iii) the nature
of the proposed conversion/continuation, (iv) in the case of a conversion to, or
a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the requested Interest Period, and
(v) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate
Loan, that no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, Company may give Agent telephonic notice by the
required time of any proposed conversion/continuation under this subsection
2.2D; provided that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by
delivery of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Administrative Agent on or
before the proposed conversion/continuation date. Upon receipt of written or
telephonic notice of any proposed conversion/continuation under this subsection
2.2D, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender.

                  Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any
liability to Company in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that
Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly
authorized officer or other person authorized to act on behalf of Company or for
otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.2D, and upon conversion
or continuation of the applicable basis for determining the interest rate with
respect to any Loans in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such
telephonic notice Company shall have effected a conversion or continuation, as
the case may be, hereunder.

                  Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and
2.6G, a Notice of Conversion/Continuation for conversion to, or continuation of,
a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be
irrevocable and Company shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in
accordance therewith.

                  E.       Default Rate. In the event that the outstanding
principal amount of any Loan, any interest or any fees or other amounts due and
payable hereunder are not paid when due, such overdue amounts shall thereafter
bear interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable upon demand at a
rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under
this Agreement with respect to the applicable Loans (or, in the case of any such
fees and other amounts, at a rate which is 2% per annum, in excess of the
interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement for Alternate Base Rate
Loans); provided that, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, upon the expiration
of the Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in interest rate
is effective such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon become Alternate Base
Rate Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate
which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under
this Agreement for Alternate Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the
increased rates of interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a
permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any
Event of

<PAGE>

                                      -39-

Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative
Agent or any Lender.

                  F.       Computation of Interest. Interest on the Loans shall
be computed on the basis of (i) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans a 360-day
year or (ii) in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, a 365 or 366 day year,
unless the interest rate on such Alternate Base Rate Loans is based on the
Federal Funds Rate, in which case the calculation will be on the basis of a 360
day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period
during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the
making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such
Loan or, with respect to an Alternate Base Rate Loan being converted from a
Eurodollar Rate Loan the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan to such
Alternate Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of
payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to
such Loan or, with respect to an Alternate Base Rate Loan being converted to a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such
Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; provided that if a
Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be
paid on that Loan.

                  2.3.     Fees

                  A.       Commitment Fees. Company agrees to pay to
Administrative Agent, for distribution to each Revolving Lender in proportion to
that Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share, commitment fees for the period from and
including the Closing Date to and excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment
Termination Date equal to the average of the daily excess of the Revolving Loan
Commitments over the sum of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Revolving Loans (but not any outstanding Swing Line Loans) and the Letter of
Credit Usage multiplied by the percentage per annum determined by reference to
the applicable percentage set forth in the table below opposite the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio for the four-Fiscal Quarter period ending on the date for which
the applicable Compliance Certificate has been delivered pursuant to subsection
6.1(iii), such commitment fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year
and the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on
the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year,
commencing on March 31, 2004, and on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination
Date:

or penalty, the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount up to the amount by
which the Revolving Loan Commitments exceed the Total Utilization of Revolving
Loan Commitments at the time of such proposed termination or reduction after
giving effect to any prepayments of the Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans
made on the effective date thereof; provided that any such partial reduction of
the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of
$1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount.
Company's notice to

<PAGE>

                                      -44-

Administrative Agent shall designate the date (which shall be a Business Day) of
such termination or reduction and the amount of any partial reduction, and such
termination or reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be effective on
the date specified in Company's notice and shall reduce the Revolving Loan
Commitment of each Revolving Lender proportionately to its Pro Rata Share.

                  (iii)    Application of Prepayments and Unscheduled Reductions
of Revolving Loan Commitments.

                  (a)      Application of Voluntary Prepayments by Type of Loans
and Maturity. Any voluntary prepayments pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be
applied as specified by Company in the applicable notice of prepayment. In the
event Company fails to specify the Loans to which prepayment shall be applied,
such prepayment shall be applied first, to outstanding Swing Line Loans to the
full extent thereof, second to outstanding Revolving Loans to the full extent
thereof, and third to outstanding Term Loans pro rata between Tranche A Term
Loans and Tranche B Term Loans based upon the aggregate amounts then outstanding
to the full extent thereof. Any voluntary prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant
to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be applied to reduce the scheduled installments of
principal of the Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans set forth in
subsections 2.4A(i) and (ii), respectively, as specified by Company.

                  (b)      Application of Prepayments to Alternate Base Rate
Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans. Considering Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B
Term Loans and Revolving Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment thereof
shall be applied first to Alternate Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof
before application to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case in a manner which
minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by Company pursuant to
subsection 2.6D.

                  C.       General Provisions Regarding Payments.

                  (i)      Manner and Time of Payment. All payments by Company
of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations hereunder and under the Notes
shall be made in Dollars in same day funds, without defense, setoff or
counterclaim, free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date
due at the Funding and Payment Office for the account of Lenders; funds received
by Administrative Agent after that time on such due date shall be deemed to have
been paid by Company on the next succeeding Business Day. Company hereby
authorizes Administrative Agent to charge its accounts with Agent in order to
cause timely payment to be made to Administrative Agent of all principal,
interest, fees and expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being
available in its accounts for that purpose).

                  (ii)     Application of Payments to Principal and Interest.
Except as provided in subsection 2.2C, all payments in respect of the principal
amount of any Loan shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal
amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments

<PAGE>

                                      -45-

(and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when interest
is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of
interest before application to principal.

                  (iii)    Apportionment of Payments. Aggregate principal and
interest payments in respect of Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and
Revolving Loans shall be apportioned among all outstanding Loans to which such
payments relate, in each case proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro Rata
Shares. Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, at its
primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page
hereof or at such other address as such Lender may request, its Pro Rata Share
of all such payments received by Administrative Agent and the commitment fees of
such Lender when received by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.4C(iii), if,
pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2.6C, any Notice of
Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any
Affected Lender makes Alternate Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share of
any Eurodollar Rate Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in
apportioning payments received thereafter.

                  (iv)     Payments on Business Days. Whenever any payment to be
made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such
extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of
interest hereunder or of the commitment fees hereunder, as the case may be.

                  (v)      Notation of Payment. Each Lender agrees that before
disposing of any Note held by it, or any part thereof (other than by granting
participations therein), that Lender will make a notation thereon of all Loans
evidenced by that Note and all principal payments previously made thereon and of
the date to which interest thereon has been paid; provided that the failure to
make (or any error in the making of) a notation of any Loan made under such Note
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Company hereunder or
under such Note with respect to any Loan or any payments of principal or
interest on such Note.

                  D.       Application of Proceeds of Collateral and Payments
Under Subsidiary Guaranty.

                  (i)      Application of Proceeds of Collateral. All proceeds
received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or
other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral under any Pledge
Agreements may, in the discretion of the Collateral Agent, be held by Collateral
Agent as Collateral for, and/or (then or at any time thereafter) applied in full
or in part by the Collateral Agent against, the applicable secured obligations
(as defined in such Pledge Agreement, the "Secured Obligations") in the
following order of priority:

                  (a)      to the payment of all costs and expenses of such
         sale, collection or other realization, including reasonable
         compensation to Collateral Agent and its agents and counsel, and all
         other expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Collateral

<PAGE>

                                      -46-

         Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts for which Collateral
         Agent is entitled to indemnification under such Pledge Agreement and
         all advances made by Collateral Agent thereunder for the account of the
         applicable Loan Party, and to the payment of all costs and expenses
         paid or incurred by Collateral Agent in connection with the exercise of
         any right or remedy under such Pledge Agreement, all in accordance with
         the terms of this Agreement and such Pledge Agreement;

                  (b)      thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         proceeds, to the payment of all other such Secured Obligations for the
         ratable benefit of the holders thereof;

                  (c)      thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         proceeds, to the payment of cash collateral for Letters of Credit for
         the ratable benefit of the Issuing Lenders thereof and holders of
         participations therein; and

                  (d)      thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         proceeds, to the payment to or upon the order of such Loan Party or to
         whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of
         competent jurisdiction may direct.

                  (ii)     Application of Payments Under Subsidiary Guaranty.
All payments received by Administrative Agent under the Subsidiary Guaranty
shall be applied promptly from time to time by Administrative Agent in the
following order of priority:

                  (a)      to the payment of the costs and expenses of any
         collection or other realization under the Subsidiary Guaranty,
         including reasonable compensation to Administrative Agent and its
         agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or
         incurred by Administrative Agent in connection therewith, all in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Subsidiary
         Guaranty;

                  (b)      thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         payments, to the payment of all other Guarantied Obligations (as
         defined in the Subsidiary Guaranty) for the ratable benefit of the
         holders thereof;

                  (c)      thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         payments, to the payment of cash collateral for Letters of Credit for
         the ratable benefit of the Issuing Lenders thereof and holders of
         participations therein; and

                  (d)      thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         payments, to the payment to the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor or to
         whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of
         competent jurisdiction may direct.

                  2.5.     Use of Proceeds

                  A.       Term Loans. The proceeds of the Term Loans and
Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date shall be used:

<PAGE>

                                      -47-

                  (i)      to refinance the Indebtedness outstanding under the
         Existing Credit Agreement;

                  (ii)     to pay fees and expenses in connection with the
         Refinancing; and

                  (iii)    for working capital and general corporate purposes.

                  B.       Revolving Loans; Swing Line Loans. Revolving Loans
and any Swing Line Loans shall also be used for working capital requirements and
general corporate purposes, which may include the making of intercompany loans
to any of Company's Wholly Owned Subsidiaries, for making acquisitions and for
the refinancing of the 9 5/8% Notes.

                  C.       Margin Regulations. No portion of the proceeds of any
borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any manner that might cause the borrowing or the application of
such proceeds to violate Regulation U, Regulation T or Regulation X of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board
or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the date or dates
of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

                  2.6.     Special Provisions Governing Eurodollar Rate Loans

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate
Loans as to the matters covered:

                  A.       Determination of Applicable Interest Rate. As soon as
         practicable after 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on each Interest Rate
         Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine (which
         determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and
         binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to the
         Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then being
         determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give
         notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to
         Company and each Lender.

                  B.       Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. In
         the event that Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
         determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all
         parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect
         to any Eurodollar Rate Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting
         the interbank Eurodollar market adequate and fair means do not exist
         for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the
         basis provided for in the definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate,
         Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile
         or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender of
         such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted
         to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative Agent
         notifies Company and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
         notice no longer exist and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of

<PAGE>

                                      -48-

         Conversion/Continuation given by Company with respect to the Loans in
         respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be
         rescinded by Company.

                  C.       Illegality of Eurodollar Rate Loans. In the event
         that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which determination
         shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but
         shall be made only after consultation with Administrative Agent) that
         the making, maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans
         has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good
         faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or
         order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule,
         regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though
         the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), then, and in
         any such event, such Lender shall be an "Affected Lender" and it shall
         on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in
         writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such determination
         (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each
         other Lender). Thereafter (a) the obligation of the Affected Lender to
         make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
         suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender,
         (b) to the extent such determination by the Affected Lender relates to
         a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a
         Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the
         Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as
         the case may be) an Alternate Base Rate Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's
         obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the
         "Affected Loans") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the
         expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the
         Affected Loans or when required by law, and (d) the Affected Loans
         shall automatically convert into Alternate Base Rate Loans on the date
         of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a
         determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates to a
         Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a
         Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Company
         shall have the option, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, to
         rescind such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation
         as to all Lenders by giving notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone
         confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of such rescission on the
         date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as
         described above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall
         promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in the
         immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection 2.6C shall
         affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to
         make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar Rate
         Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  D.       Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement of
         Interest Periods. Company shall compensate each Lender, upon written
         request by that Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable
         detail the basis for requesting such amounts), for all reasonable
         losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid by that
         Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its
         Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss,

<PAGE>

                                      -49-

         expense or liability sustained by that Lender in connection with the
         liquidation or re-employment of such funds) which that Lender may
         sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by that Lender) a
         borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date
         specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a telephonic request for
         borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any Eurodollar Rate
         Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of
         Conversion/Continuation or a telephonic request for conversion or
         continuation, (ii) if any prepayment (including any prepayment pursuant
         to subsection 2.4B(i) or by virtue of the replacement of any Lender
         pursuant to subsection 2.8B or 10.6B) or other principal payment or any
         conversion of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a date prior
         to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan, (iii) if
         any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any
         date specified in a notice of prepayment given by Company, or (iv) as a
         consequence of any other default by Company in the repayment of its
         Eurodollar Rate Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement.

                  E.       Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender may
         make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the
         account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of
         that Lender; provided, that such making, carrying or transferring
         Eurodollar Rate Loans does not result in any costs or taxes to Company
         pursuant to subsection 2.7.

                  F.       Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate
         Loans. Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this
         subsection 2.6 and under subsection 2.7A shall be made as though that
         Lender had actually funded each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans
         through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the
         rate obtained pursuant to the definition of Eurodollar Rate in an
         amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a
         maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the
         transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that
         Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United States of
         America; provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its
         Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing
         assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating
         amounts payable under this subsection 2.6 and under subsection 2.7A.

                  G.       Eurodollar Rate Loans After Default. After the
         occurrence of and during the continuation of a Potential Event of
         Default or an Event of Default, (i) Company may not elect to have a
         Loan be made or maintained as, or converted to, a Eurodollar Rate Loan
         after the expiration of any Interest Period then in effect for that
         Loan and (ii) subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, any Notice
         of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Company with
         respect to a requested borrowing or conversion/continuation that has
         not yet occurred shall be deemed to be rescinded by Company.

                  2.7.     Increased Costs; Taxes; Capital Adequacy

                  A.       Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes. Subject
to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with respect to
the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender shall determine
(which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order, or any change therein or in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof (including the introduction of any new
law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order), or any determination of
a court or governmental authority, in each case that becomes effective after the
date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any guideline, request or
directive issued or made after the date hereof by any central bank or other
governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
law):

                  (i)      subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending
         office) to any additional Tax (other than any Tax on the Overall Net
         Income of such Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any of its
         obligations hereunder or any payments to such Lender (or its applicable
         lending office) of principal, interest, fees or any other amount
         payable hereunder;

                  (ii)     imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve
         (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
         reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
         requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in
         or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit
         extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such
         Lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect
         to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of
         Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or

                  (iii)    imposes any other condition (other than with respect
         to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending
         office) or its obligations hereunder or the interbank Eurodollar
         market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost
         to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or maintaining Loans
         hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender
         (or its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any
         such case, Company shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of
         the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount
         or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method
         of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole
         discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such
         Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or
         receivable hereunder; provided that Company shall not be required to
         compensate a Lender pursuant to this subsection for any increased cost
         or reduction incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such
         Lender notifies Company of such change giving rise to such increased
         cost or reduction and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation
         therefor; provided, further, that, if such change giving rise to such
         increased cost or reduction is retroactive, then the 180 day period
         referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
         retroactive effect thereof. Such Lender shall deliver to

<PAGE>

                                      -51-

         Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement,
         setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the
         additional amounts owed to such Lender under this subsection 2.7A,
         which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
         absent manifest error.

                  B.       Withholding of Taxes.

                  (i)      Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by
Company under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall (except to the
extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or
withholding on account of, any Tax (other than a Tax on the Overall Net Income
of any Lender) imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the
United States of America or any political subdivision in or of the United States
of America or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made by or on
behalf of Company or by any federation or organization of which the United
States of America or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment.

                  (ii)     Grossing-Up of Payments. If Company or any other
Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any
such Tax from any sum paid or payable by Company to Administrative Agent or any
Lender under any of the Loan Documents:

                  (a)      Company shall notify Administrative Agent of any such
         requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as Company
         becomes aware of it;

                  (b)      Company shall pay any such Tax before the date on
         which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the
         liability to pay is imposed on Company) for its own account or (if that
         liability is imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the
         case may be) on behalf of and in the name of Administrative Agent or
         such Lender;

                  (c)      the sum payable by Company in respect of which the
         relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be
         increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of
         that deduction, withholding or payment, Administrative Agent or such
         Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to
         what it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or
         payment been required or made; and

                  (d)      within 30 days after paying any sum from which it is
         required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within 30
         days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required by
         clause (b) above to pay, Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent
         evidence satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction,
         withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant
         taxing or other authority;

provided that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid to any
Lender under clause (c) above except to the extent that any change in any law,
treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or in
the interpretation, administration or application thereof (in-

                                      -52-

cluding the introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation
or order), or any determination of a court or governmental authority, in each
case that becomes effective after the date hereof (in the case of each Lender
listed on the signature pages hereof) or after the date of the Assignment
Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each
other Lender) affecting any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or
payment as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such
deduction, withholding or payment from that in effect at the date of this
Agreement or at the date of such Assignment Agreement, as the case may be, in
respect of payments to such Lender.

                  (iii)    Evidence of Exemption From Withholding Tax.

                  (a)      Each Lender that is not a United States person as
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code (for purposes of
this subsection 2.7B(iii), a "Non-US Lender") shall deliver to Administrative
Agent for transmission to Company, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case
of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on or prior to the date
of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case
of each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary in the
determination of Company or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable
exercise of its discretion), (1) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY, as the case may be (or any successor
forms), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with any
other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Internal Revenue
Code or the regulations issued thereunder to establish that such Lender is not
subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts payable under any of the Loan Documents or (2) if such Lender is not a
"bank" or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code, a Certificate re Non-Bank Status together with two original copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8IMY (or any successor form), properly
completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with any other certificates
or statements of exemption requested by Company required under the Internal
Revenue Code or the regulations issued thereunder to establish that such Lender
is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax
with respect to any payments to such Lender of interest payable under any of the
Loan Documents.

                  (b)      Each Lender required to deliver any forms,
certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal income tax
withholding matters pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) hereby agrees, from time
to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or
other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such
forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material
respect, that such Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to Administrative Agent for
transmission to Company two new original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as the case may be, or a Certificate re Non-Bank
Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
W-8IMY, as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender,
together with any other certificates or statements of exemption requested by

<PAGE>

                                      -53-

Company required in order to confirm or establish that such Lender is not
subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
respect to payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents or (2) notify
Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such forms,
certificates or other evidence.

                  (c)      Company shall not be required to pay any additional
amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of subsection 2.7B(ii) if such
Lender shall have failed to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) or (b)(1) of
this subsection 2.7B(iii); provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied the
requirements of subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) on the Closing Date (in the case of each
Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on the date of the Assignment
Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender (in the case of each other
Lender), nothing in this subsection 2.7B(iii)(c) shall relieve Company of its
obligation to pay any additional amounts pursuant to clause (c) of subsection
2.7B(ii) in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law,
treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer
properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to
withholding as described in subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).

                  C.       Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender shall have
determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the
date hereof of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding
capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Lender (or its applicable lending office) with any guideline, request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or
any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference
to, such Lender's Loans or Commitments or Letters of Credit or participations
therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters
of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling
corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase-in,
applicability, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of
such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy),
then from time to time, within five Business Days after receipt by Company from
such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, Company shall pay
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
or such controlling corporation on an after-tax basis for such reduction;
provided that Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to
this subsection for any reduction incurred more than 180 days prior to the date
that such Lender notifies Company of such change giving rise to such reduction
and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided,
further, that, if such change giving rise to such reduction is retroactive, then
the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof. Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to
Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis of

<PAGE>

                                      -54-

the calculation of such additional amounts, which statement shall be conclusive
and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

                  D.       Refund and Contest. If Administrative Agent or any
Lender receives a refund with respect to Tax deducted, withheld or paid by
Company and with respect to which Company has been required to and has paid an
additional amount under this subsection 2.7, which in the good faith judgment of
such Lender is allocable to such deduction, withholding or payment, it shall
promptly pay such refund, together with any other amount paid by Company in
connection with such refunded Tax and any interest paid by the relevant
governmental authority with respect to such refund, to Company, net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender incurred in obtaining such refund,
provided, however, that Company agrees to promptly return such refund to
Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, if it
receives notice from Administrative Agent or applicable Lender that such
Administrative Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund. Each of
Administrative Agent and such Lender agrees that it will contest such Tax or
liabilities paid by Company if Agent or such Lender determines, in its sole
discretion, that it would not be materially disadvantaged or prejudiced as a
result of such contest.

                  2.8.     Obligation of Lenders and Issuing Lenders to
                           Mitigate; Replacement

                  A.       Mitigation. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees
that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender or Issuing
Lender responsible for administering the Loans or Letters of Credit of such
Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, becomes aware of the occurrence of
an event or the existence of a condition that would cause such Lender to become
an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to
receive payments under subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6, it will, to the extent
not inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender or Issuing Lender and
any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use reasonable efforts (i) to
make, issue, fund or maintain the Commitments of such Lender or the affected
Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender through another
lending or letter of credit office of such Lender or Issuing Lender, or (ii)
take such other measures as such Lender or Issuing Lender may deem reasonable,
which may include assignment of its rights and obligations hereunder to another
of its offices, branches or affiliates, if as a result thereof the circumstances
which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or
the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such
Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 would be
materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in its
sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such Commitments
or Loans or Letters of Credit through such other lending or letter of credit
office or in accordance with such other measures, including assignment, as the
case may be, would not otherwise materially adversely affect such Commitments or
Loans or Letters of Credit or the interests of such Lender or Issuing Lender;
provided that such Lender or Issuing Lender will not be obligated to utilize
such other lending or letter of credit office pursuant to this subsection 2.8
unless Company agrees to pay all reasonable incremental expenses in-

<PAGE>

                                      -55-

curred by such Lender or Issuing Lender as a result of utilizing such other
lending or letter of credit office as described in clause (i) above. A
certificate as to the amount of any such expenses payable by Company pursuant to
this subsection 2.8 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting
such amount) submitted by such Lender or Issuing Lender to Company (with a copy
to Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  B.       Replacement. In the event of (a) a refusal by a
Lender to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with
respect to this Agreement which has been approved by Requisite Lenders (but
requires consent of all Lenders) as provided in subsection 10.6, (b) any Lender
becomes an Affected Lender or requests compensation under subsection 2.7A, 2.7C
or 3.6, (c) Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or
any governmental authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to subsection
2.7B, or (d) any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then
Company may, at its sole expense and effort, replace such Lender (a "Replaced
Lender") with one or more Eligible Assignees (collectively, the "Replacement
Lender") acceptable to Administrative Agent, provided that (i) at the time of
any replacement pursuant to this subsection 2.8 the Replacement Lender shall
enter into one or more Assignment Agreements pursuant to subsection 10.1B (and
with all fees payable pursuant to such subsection 10.1B to be paid by the
Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all
of the outstanding Loans and Commitments of, and in each case participations in
Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans by, the Replaced Lender and, in
connection therewith, shall pay to (x) the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an
amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all
accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, (B) an amount
equal to all unpaid drawings with respect to Letters of Credit that have been
funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender, together with all then
unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount equal to all
accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender with respect
thereto, (y) the appropriate Issuing Lender an amount equal to such Replaced
Lender's Pro Rata Share of any unpaid drawings with respect to Letters of Credit
(which at such time remains an unpaid drawing) issued by it to the extent such
amount was not theretofore funded by such Replaced Lender, and (z) Swing Line
Lender an amount equal to such Replaced Lender's Pro Rata Share of any Refunded
Swing Line Loans to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded by such
Replaced Lender, and (ii) all obligations (including without limitation all such
amounts, if any, owing under subsection 2.6D) of Company owing to the Replaced
Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect
of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being,
paid), shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such
replacement. Upon the execution of the respective Assignment Agreements and the
acceptance thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 10.1B, the
payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so
requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to the Replacement Lender of the
appropriate Note or Notes executed by Company, the Replacement Lender shall
become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a
Lender hereunder except with respect to indemnification provisions under this
Agreement which by the terms of this Agreement survive the termination of this
Agreement, which indemnification provisions shall survive as to such Replaced
Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

<PAGE>

                                      -56-

contained above, no Issuing Lender may be replaced hereunder at any time while
it has Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory
to such Issuing Lender (including the furnishing of a Standby Letter of Credit
in form and substance, and issued by an issuer satisfactory to such Issuing
Lender or the furnishing of cash collateral in amounts and pursuant to
arrangements satisfactory to such Issuing Lender) have been made with respect to
such outstanding Letters of Credit. A Lender shall not be required to make any
such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Company to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                   SECTION 3.

                                LETTERS OF CREDIT

                  3.1.     Issuance of Letters of Credit and Lenders' Purchase
                           of Participations Therein

                  A.       Letters of Credit. In addition to Company requesting
that Revolving Lenders make Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(ii) and
that Swing Line Lender make Swing Line Loans pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iii),
Company may request, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 3.1,
from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the
date that is 30 days prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date,
that one or more Revolving Lenders issue Letters of Credit for the account of
Company. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance
upon the representations and warranties of Company herein set forth, any one or
more Revolving Lenders may, but (except as provided in subsection 3.1B(ii))
shall not be obligated to, issue such Letters of Credit in accordance with the
provisions of this subsection 3.1; provided that such Letters of Credit shall be
issued on a sight basis only and Company shall not request that any Revolving
Lender issue (and no Revolving Lender shall issue):

                  (i)      any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
         issuance, the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments would
         exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect;

                  (ii)     any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such
         issuance, the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $100,000,000;

                  (iii)    any Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other
         than Dollars; or

                  (iv)     any Letter of Credit having an expiration date later
         than the earlier of (a) the date that is five Business Days prior to
         the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and (b) the date which
         is one year from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit;
         provided that the immediately preceding clause (b) shall not prevent
         any Issuing Lender from agreeing that a Letter of Credit will
         automatically be extended for one or more successive periods not to
         exceed one year each unless such Issuing Lender elects not to ex-

<PAGE>

                                      -57-

         tend for any such additional period; and provided, further, that such
         Issuing Lender shall elect not to extend such Letter of Credit if it
         has knowledge that an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default
         has occurred and is continuing (and has not been waived in accordance
         with subsection 10.6) at the time such Issuing Lender must elect
         whether or not to allow such extension.

                  B.       Mechanics of Issuance.

                  (i)      Notice of Issuance. Whenever Company desires the
issuance of a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver to the proposed Issuing Lender
and Administrative Agent a Notice of Request to Issue Letter of Credit in the
form of Exhibit III annexed hereto no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time)
at least three Business Days or in each case such shorter period as may be
agreed to by the proposed Issuing Lender in any particular instance, in advance
of the proposed date of issuance. The Notice of Request to Issue Letter of
Credit shall specify (a) the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a
Business Day), (b) the face amount of the Letter of Credit, (c) the expiration
date of the Letter of Credit, (d) the name and address of the beneficiary, and
(e) either the verbatim text of the proposed Letter of Credit or the proposed
terms and conditions thereof, including a precise description of any documents
to be presented by the beneficiary which, if presented by the beneficiary prior
to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, would require the Issuing Lender
to make payment under the Letter of Credit; provided that the Issuing Lender, in
its reasonable discretion, may require changes in the text of the proposed
Letter of Credit or any such documents.

                  Company shall notify the applicable Issuing Lender (and
Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such Issuing Lender) prior
to the issuance of any Letter of Credit in the event that any of the matters to
which Company is required to certify in the applicable Notice of Request to
Issue Letter of Credit is no longer true and correct as of the proposed date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit, and upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit
Company shall be deemed to have re-certified, as of the date of such issuance,
as to the matters to which Company is required to certify in the applicable
Notice of Request to Issue Letter of Credit.

                  The existing Letters of Credit identified on Schedule 3.1B(i)
shall be deemed issued under and pursuant to this subsection 3.1B(i) and shall
be treated as Letters of Credit for all purposes under this Agreement.

                  (ii)     Determination of Issuing Lender. Upon receipt by a
proposed Issuing Lender and Administrative Agent of a Notice of Request to Issue
Letter of Credit pursuant to subsection 3.1B(i) requesting the issuance of a
Letter of Credit, any Revolving Lender so requested to issue such Letter of
Credit shall promptly notify Company and Administrative Agent whether or not, in
its sole discretion, it has elected to issue such Letter of Credit, and any such
Revolving Lender which so elects to issue such Letter of Credit shall be the
Issuing Lender with respect thereto. In the event that the proposed Issuing
Lender selected by Company with respect to any Letter of Credit shall have
declined to issue such Letter of Credit, Administrative Agent shall be obligated
to issue such Letter of Credit and shall be the Issuing Lender with respect

<PAGE>

                                      -58-

thereto, notwithstanding the fact that the Letter of Credit Usage with respect
to such Letter of Credit and with respect to all other Letters of Credit issued
by Administrative Agent, when aggregated with Administrative Agent's outstanding
Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans, may exceed Administrative Agent's
Revolving Loan Commitment then in effect.

                  (iii)    Issuance of Letter of Credit. Upon satisfaction or
waiver (in accordance with subsection 10.6) of the conditions set forth in
subsection 4.3, the Issuing Lender shall issue the requested Letter of Credit in
accordance with the Issuing Lender's standard operating procedures.

                  (iv)     Notification to Revolving Lenders. Upon the issuance
of any Letter of Credit the applicable Issuing Lender shall promptly notify
Administrative Agent and each other Revolving Lender of such issuance, which
notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of Credit. Promptly after
receipt of such notice (or, if Administrative Agent is the Issuing Lender,
together with such notice), Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving
Lender of the amount of such Revolving Lender's respective participation in such
Letter of Credit, determined in accordance with subsection 3.1C.

                  (v)      Reports to Revolving Lenders. Within 5 days after the
end of each calendar quarter ending after the Closing Date, so long as any
Letter of Credit shall have been outstanding during such calendar quarter, each
Issuing Lender shall deliver to Administrative Agent a report setting forth for
such calendar quarter the daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under the
Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender that were outstanding during
such calendar quarter.

                  C.       Revolving Lenders' Purchase of Participations in
Letters of Credit. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably
purchased from the Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and
any drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become
available to be drawn thereunder.

                  3.2.     Letter of Credit Fees

                  Company agrees to pay the following amounts with respect to
Letters of Credit issued hereunder:

                  (i)      with respect to each Letter of Credit, (a) a fronting
         fee, payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own
         account, equal to 0.125% per annum of the daily amount available to be
         drawn under such Letter of Credit and (b) a letter of credit fee,
         payable to Administrative Agent for the account of Revolving Lenders,
         equal to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin for Revolving Loans per
         annum of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
         Credit, each such fronting fee and letter of credit fee to be payable
         in arrears on and to (but excluding) the last Business Day of

<PAGE>

                                      -59-

         March, June, September and December of each year and computed on the
         basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed;

                  (ii)     with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer
         of each Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made thereunder
         (without duplication of the fees payable under clauses (a) and (b)
         above), documentary and processing charges payable directly to the
         applicable Issuing Lender for its own account in accordance with such
         Issuing Lender's standard schedule for such charges in effect at the
         time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may
         be.

                  For purposes of calculating any fees payable under clause (i)
of this subsection 3.2, the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter
of Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of
determination. Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount
described in clause (i)(b) of this subsection 3.2, Administrative Agent shall
distribute to each Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share of such amount.

                  3.3.     Drawings and Reimbursement of Amounts Paid Under
                           Letters of Credit

                  A.       Responsibility of Issuing Lender With Respect to
Drawings. In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to
examine the documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care
so as to ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

                  B.       Reimbursement by Company of Amounts Paid Under
Letters of Credit. In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a
drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall
immediately notify Company and Administrative Agent, and Company shall reimburse
such Issuing Lender on or before the Business Day immediately following the date
on which such drawing is honored (the "Reimbursement Date") in an amount in
Dollars and in same day funds equal to the amount of such honored drawing;
provided that, anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) unless Company shall have notified Administrative Agent and
such Issuing Lender prior to 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the Business Day
following the date such drawing is honored that Company intends to reimburse
such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than
the proceeds of Revolving Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely
Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent requesting Revolving Lenders to make
Revolving Loans that are Alternate Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in
an amount in Dollars equal to the amount of such honored drawing and (ii)
subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in subsection
4.2B, Revolving Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans
that are Base Rate Loans in the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of
which shall be applied directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse such
Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing; and provided, further
that if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by such
Issuing Lender on the Reimbursement Date in an amount

<PAGE>

                                      -60-

equal to the amount of such honored drawing, Company shall reimburse such
Issuing Lender, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of
the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving
Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this subsection 3.3B shall be
deemed to relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligation to make Revolving
Loans on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Company shall
retain any and all rights it may have against any Revolving Lender resulting
from the failure of such Revolving Lender to make such Revolving Loans under
this subsection 3.3B.

                  C.       Payment by Revolving Lenders of Unreimbursed Amounts
Paid Under Letters of Credit.

                  (i)      Payment by Revolving Lenders. In the event that
Company shall fail for any reason to reimburse any Issuing Lender as provided in
subsection 3.3B in an amount equal to the amount of any drawing honored by such
Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall
promptly notify each other Revolving Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such
honored drawing and of such other Revolving Lender's respective participation
therein based on such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share. Each Revolving Lender
shall make available to such Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective
participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of such Issuing
Lender specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time)
on the first business day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such
office of such Issuing Lender is located) after the date notified by such
Issuing Lender. In the event that any Revolving Lender fails to make available
to such Issuing Lender on such business day the amount of such Revolving
Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this subsection
3.3C, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand
from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the rate
customarily used by such Issuing Lender for the correction of errors among banks
for three Business Days and thereafter at the Alternate Base Rate. Nothing in
this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Revolving
Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such
Revolving Lender to such Issuing Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.3C in the
event that it is determined by the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit by such Issuing
Lender in respect of which payment was made by such Revolving Lender constituted
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender.

                  (ii)     Distribution to Revolving Lenders of Reimbursements
Received From Company. In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been
reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or
any portion of any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of
Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other
Revolving Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under subsection
3.3C(i) with respect to such honored drawing such other Revolving Lender's Pro
Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by such Issuing Lender from
Company in reimbursement of such honored drawing when such payments are
received. Any such distribution shall be made to a Revolving

                                      -61-

Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate
signature page hereof or at such other address as such Revolving Lender may
request.

                  D.       Interest on Amounts Paid Under Letters of Credit.

                  (i)      Payment of Interest by Company. Company agrees to pay
to each Issuing Lender, with respect to drawings honored under any Letters of
Credit issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing Lender in
respect of each such honored drawing from the date such drawing is honored to
but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by Company (including any such
reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection
3.3B) at a rate equal to (a) for the period from the date such drawing is
honored to but excluding the Reimbursement Date, the rate then in effect under
this Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans that are Alternate Base Rate
Loans and (b) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the rate of
interest otherwise payable under this Agreement with respect to Revolving Loans
that are Alternate Base Rate Loans. Interest payable pursuant to this subsection
3.3D(i) shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year for the actual
number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues and shall be
payable on demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related
drawing under a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full.

                  (ii)     Distribution of Interest Payments by Issuing Lender.
Promptly upon receipt by any Issuing Lender of any payment of interest pursuant
to subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a drawing honored under a Letter of Credit
issued by it, (a) such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other Revolving
Lender, out of the interest received by such Issuing Lender in respect of the
period from the date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which
such Issuing Lender is reimbursed for the amount of such drawing (including any
such reimbursement out of the proceeds of Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection
3.3B), the amount that such other Revolving Lender would have been entitled to
receive in respect of the letter of credit fee that would have been payable in
respect of such Letter of Credit for such period pursuant to subsection 3.2 if
no drawing had been honored under such Letter of Credit, and (b) in the event
such Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders
pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of such honored drawing,
such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other Revolving Lender which has
paid all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such
honored drawing such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest
received by such Issuing Lender in respect of that portion of such honored
drawing so reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders for the period from the date on
which such Issuing Lender was so reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders to but
excluding the date on which such portion of such honored drawing is reimbursed
by Company. Any such distribution shall be made to a Revolving Lender at its
primary address set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page
hereof or at such other address as such Revolving Lender may request.

                  3.4.     Obligations Absolute

                  The obligation of Company to reimburse each Issuing Lender for
drawings honored under the Letters of Credit issued by it and to repay any

ing Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3B and the obligations of Revolving Lenders
under subsection 3.3C(i) shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be
paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances including any of the following circumstances:

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
         of Credit;

                  (ii)     the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
         right which Company or any Revolving Lender may have at any time
         against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any
         Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Lender
         or other Revolving Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a
         Revolving Lender, against Company, whether in connection with this
         Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated
         transaction (including any underlying transaction between Company or
         one of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary for which any Letter of
         Credit was procured);

                  (iii)    any draft or other document presented under any
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv)     payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under any
         Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document
         which does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of
         Credit;

                  (v)      any adverse change in the business, operations,
         properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

                  (vi)     any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan
         Document by any party thereto;

                  (vii)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; or

                  (viii)   the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential
         Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

provided, in each case, that payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under the
applicable Letter of Credit shall not have constituted gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender under the circumstances in question
(as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

                  3.5.     Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties

                  A.       Indemnification. In addition to amounts payable as
provided in subsection 3.6, Company hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and
save harmless each Issuing Lender from and against any and all claims, demands,
liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable
fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal
counsel) which such Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence,
direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing
Lender, other than as a result of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Issuing Lender as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or (b) subject to the following clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor
by such Issuing Lender of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of
Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing Lender to honor a
drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission,
whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto
government or governmental authority (all such acts or omissions herein called
"Governmental Acts").

                  B.       Nature of Issuing Lenders' Duties. As between Company
and any Issuing Lender, Company assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of,
or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender by, the
respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for:
(i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of
any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and
issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in
any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;
(ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of
any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions required in order
to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or
delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph,
telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in
interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or
otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such
Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the
beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under
such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the
control of such Issuing Lender, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the
above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of such Issuing
Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5B,
any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with
the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered
thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender
under any resulting liability to Company, except for liability arising solely
out of the gross negli-

<PAGE>

                                      -64-

gence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender, as determined by a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  3.6.     Increased Costs and Taxes Relating to Letters of
Credit

                  Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be
controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any
Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender shall determine (which determination shall,
absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto) that any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any
change therein or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof
(including the introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule,
regulation or order), or any determination of a court or governmental authority,
in each case that becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by any
Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender with any guideline, request or directive
issued or made after the date hereof by any central bank or other governmental
or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law):

                  (i)      subjects such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or
         its applicable lending or letter of credit office) to any additional
         Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such Issuing
         Lender or Revolving Lender) with respect to the issuing or maintaining
         of any Letters of Credit or the purchasing or maintaining of any
         participations therein or any other obligations under this Section 3,
         whether directly or by such being imposed on or suffered by any
         particular Issuing Lender;

                  (ii)     imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve
         (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
         reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
         requirement in respect of any Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing
         Lender or participations therein purchased by any Revolving Lender; or

                  (iii)    imposes any other condition (other than with respect
         to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Issuing Lender or Revolving
         Lender (or its applicable lending or letter of credit office) regarding
         this Section 3 or any Letter of Credit or any participation therein;
         and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
         Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender of agreeing to issue, issuing or
         maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase, purchasing or
         maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount received
         or receivable by such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or its
         applicable lending or letter of credit office) with respect thereto;
         then, in any case, Company shall promptly pay to such Issuing Lender or
         Revolving Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next
         sentence, such additional amount or amounts as may be necessary to
         compensate such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender for any such
         increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable
         hereunder; provided that Company shall not be required to compensate a
         Lender pursuant to this subsection for any increased cost or reduction
         incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies
         Company of such change giving rise to such increased cost or reduction
         and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided
         further that, if

<PAGE>

                                      -65-

         such change giving rise to such increased cost or reduction is
         retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be
         extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. Such
         Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender shall deliver to Company (with a
         copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in
         reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed
         to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender under this subsection 3.6,
         which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
         absent manifest error.

                                   SECTION 4.

                    CONDITIONS TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

                           (ii)     No event shall have occurred and be
                  continuing or would result from the consummation of the

         conditions precedent described in subsection 4.2B shall be satisfied to
         the same extent as if the issuance of such Letter of Credit were the
         making of a Loan and the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit were
         a Funding Date.

                                   SECTION 5.

each Funding Date and on the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, that the
following statements are true, correct and complete:
<PAGE>

                                      -70-

                  5.1.     Organization, Powers, Qualification, Good Standing,
                           Business and Subsidiaries

                  A.       Organization and Powers. Each Loan Party is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization as specified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto. Each
Loan Party has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own and
operate its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a
party and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby.

                  B.       Qualification and Good Standing. Each Loan Party is
qualified to do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction where its
assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out its business and
operations, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  C.       Conduct of Business. Company and its Subsidiaries are
engaged only in the businesses permitted to be engaged in pursuant to subsection
7.10.

                  D.       Subsidiaries. All of the Subsidiaries of Company are
identified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto, as said Schedule 5.1 may be
supplemented from time to time pursuant to the provisions of subsection 6.1(xi).
The capital stock or other interests of each of the Subsidiaries of Company
identified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (as so supplemented) are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of
all liens except liens created by the Loan Documents and liens permitted
thereunder and none of such capital stock constitutes Margin Stock. Each of the
Subsidiaries of Company identified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (as so
supplemented) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization set forth therein, has all
requisite corporate or other power and authority to own and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted and is qualified to do business and in good standing in every
jurisdiction where its assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out
its business and operations, in each case except where failure to be so
qualified or in good standing or a lack of such corporate or other power and
authority has not had and is not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (as so supplemented) correctly sets forth
the ownership interest of Company and each of its Subsidiaries in each of the
Subsidiaries of Company identified therein.

                  5.2.     Authorization of Borrowing, Etc.

                  A.       Authorization of Borrowing. The execution, delivery
and performance of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other equivalent action on the part of each Loan Party that is a
party thereto.
<PAGE>
                                      -71-

                  B.       No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance
by Loan Parties of the Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents do not and will not (i) violate any provision
of any law or any governmental rule or regulation applicable to Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, the Certificate or Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or
other organizational documents) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of government binding on
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or
constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any
Contractual Obligation of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or
require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Liens created under
any of the Loan Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent on behalf of
Lenders), or (iv) require any approval of stockholders or any approval or
consent of any Person under any Contractual Obligation of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such approvals or consents which will be obtained on or
before the Closing Date and disclosed in writing to Lenders.

                  C.       Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and
performance by Loan Parties of the Loan Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents do not and will not require any
registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to,
with or by, any federal, state or other governmental authority or regulatory
body.

                  D.       Binding Obligation. Each of the Loan Documents has
been duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party that is a party thereto and
is the legally valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable
against such Loan Party in accordance with its respective terms, subject to (i)
the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing.

                  5.3.     Financial Condition

                  Company has heretofore delivered to Lenders, at Lenders'
request, (i) the audited financial statements (including balance sheets and
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows) of Company and
its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and (ii) the
unaudited financial statements (including balance sheets and statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows) of Company and its Subsidiaries
for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30,
2003. Except as disclosed in Company's 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2003, all such statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP and fairly
present, in all material respects, the financial position (on a consolidated
basis) of the entities described in such financial statements as at the date
thereof and the results of operations and cash flows (on a consolidated basis)
of the entities described therein for the period then ended. Company does not
(and will not immediately following the funding of the initial Loans) have any
Contingent Obligation, contingent liability or liability for taxes, long-

term lease or unusual forward or long-term commitment that is not reflected in
the foregoing financial statements or the notes thereto and which in any such
case is material in relation to the business, operations, properties, assets or
financial condition of Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                  5.4.     No Material Adverse Change

                  Since December 31, 2002, no event or change has occurred that
has caused or evidences, either in any case or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  5.5.     Title to Properties; Liens

                  Company and its Subsidiaries have (i) good title to (in the
case of fee interests in real property), (ii) valid leasehold interests in (in
the case of leasehold interests in real or personal property), or (iii) good
title to (in the case of all other personal property), all of their respective
properties and assets necessary or useful for the conduct of their business, in
each case except for assets disposed of since the date of the most recent
financial statements received by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of
business or as otherwise permitted under subsection 7.5 and except where failure
to have such title would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as permitted by this Agreement, all such properties and
assets are free and clear of Liens.

                  5.6.     Litigation; Adverse Facts

                  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.6, there are no actions,
suits, proceedings, arbitrations or governmental investigations (whether or not
purportedly on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at law or in
equity, or before or by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign (including any Environmental Claims) that are pending or, to the
knowledge of Company, threatened against or affecting Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property, license or registration of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (i) is in violation of any applicable laws (including those
involving the licensing or registration relating to the pharmaceutical and
healthcare services provided by Company and its Subsidiaries and Environmental
Laws) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) is subject to or in default with
respect to any final judgments, writs, injunctions, decrees, rules or
regulations of any court or any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -73-

                  5.7.     Payment of Taxes

                  Except to the extent permitted by subsection 6.3, (i) all tax
returns and reports of Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed by any
of them have been timely filed, and (ii) all taxes shown on such tax returns to
be due and payable and all assessments, fees and other governmental charges upon
Company and its Subsidiaries and upon their respective properties, assets,
income, businesses and franchises which are due and payable have been paid when
due and payable, except for taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings for which Company or relevant Subsidiary, as applicable,
has set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP, and in
either case, to the extent that the failure to do so would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Company knows of no proposed
material tax assessment against Company or any of its Subsidiaries which is not
being actively contested by Company or such Subsidiary in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings; provided that such reserves or other appropriate
provisions, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been
made or provided therefor.

                  5.8.     Performance of Agreements

                  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in
the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants
or conditions contained in any of its Contractual Obligations, and no condition
exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default, except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of
such default or defaults, if any, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  5.9.     Governmental Regulation

                  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding
company" under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 or an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

                  5.10.    Securities Activities

                  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.

                  5.11.    Employee Benefit Plans

                  A.       Except as would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all applicable provisions and requirements of ERISA and the
regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by any of them and have performed all their
respective obligations under each Employee Benefit Plan sponsored by any of
them.
<PAGE>
                                      -74-

                  B.       No ERISA Event that would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur.

                  C.       As of the most recent valuation date for any Pension
Plan, the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as defined in Section
4001(a)(18) of ERISA), individually or in the aggregate for all Pension Plans
(excluding for purposes of such computation any Pension Plans with respect to
which assets exceed benefit liabilities), which if amortized over ten years,
would not reasonably be expected, after considering the financial condition of
all relevant ERISA Affiliates who could have liability in respect of such
liabilities, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  D.       For each Multiemployer Plan as of the most recent
valuation date for which an actuarial report has been received, the potential
liability of Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates for
a complete withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan (within the meaning of
Section 4203 of ERISA), when aggregated with such potential liability for a
complete withdrawal from all Multiemployer Plans, based on information available
pursuant to Section 4221(e) of ERISA, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  5.12.    Environmental Protection

                  No event or condition has occurred or is occurring with
respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any Environmental Law,
that individually or in the aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  5.13.    Employee Matters

                  There is no strike or work stoppage in existence or threatened
involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  5.14.    Solvency

                  Each Loan Party is and, upon the incurrence of any Obligations
by such Loan Party on any date on which this representation is made, will be,
Solvent.

                  5.15.    Matters Relating to Collateral

                  A.       Creation, Perfection and Priority of Liens. The
execution and delivery by each Loan Party of each Pledge Agreement to which it
is a party, together with (i) the actions taken on or prior to the date hereof
pursuant to subsection 4.1E and (ii) the delivery to the Collateral Agent of any
Collateral (all of which Collateral has been so delivered) are effective to
create in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of Lenders, as security
for the respective Secured Obligations (as defined in the applicable Pledge
Agreement in respect of any Collateral), a valid and perfected First Priority
Lien on all of the Collateral, and other actions necessary or
<PAGE>
                                      -75-

desirable to perfect and maintain the perfection and First Priority status of
such Liens have been duly made or taken and remain in full force and effect.

                  B.       Governmental Authorizations. No authorization,
approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental
authority or regulatory body is required for either (i) the pledge or grant by
any Loan Party of the Liens with respect to the Collateral purported to be
created in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to any of the Pledge
Agreements or (ii) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of any rights or
remedies in respect of any Collateral (whether specifically granted or created
pursuant to any of the Pledge Agreements or created or provided for by
applicable law), except for filings or recordings contemplated by subsections
5.15A and except as may be required, in connection with the disposition of any
Collateral, by laws generally affecting the offering, sale or disposition of
property of the same type as the Collateral.

                  C.       Absence of Third-Party Filings. Except such as may
have been filed in favor of the Collateral Agent, Company has not filed any UCC
financing statement or other instrument similar in effect covering all or any
part of the Collateral in any filing or recording office.

                  D.       Margin Regulations. The pledge of the Collateral
pursuant to the Pledge Agreements does not violate Regulation T, U or X of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                  E.       Information Regarding Collateral. All information
supplied to the Collateral Agent by or on behalf of any Loan Party with respect
to any of the Collateral (in each case taken as a whole with respect to any
particular Collateral) is accurate and complete in all material respects.

                  5.16.    Disclosure

                  No representation or warranty of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries contained in any Loan Document or in any other document,
certificate or written statement furnished to Lenders by or on behalf of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taken as a whole, contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact (known to Company, in the
case of any document not furnished by it) necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances in which the same were made; provided, that no representation is
made as to projections or pro forma financial information except as set forth in
the next sentence. Any projections and pro forma financial information contained
in such materials are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed
by Company to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by Lenders
that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that
actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may
differ from the projected results.

                                   SECTION 6.

                         COMPANY'S AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

                  Company covenants and agrees that, so long as any of the
Commitments hereunder shall remain in effect and until payment in full of all of
the Loans and other Obligations and the cancellation or expiration of all
Letters of Credit, unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise give prior written
consent, Company shall perform, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
perform, all covenants in this Section 6.

                  6.1.     Financial Statements and Other Reports

                  Company will maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to

                           Laws

remedies available to them under any of the Loan Documents, even if the
conditions set forth in this paragraph are met.

                                   SECTION 9.

                                     AGENTS

                  9.1.     Appointment

                  A.       Appointment of Agent. CSFB is hereby appointed as
Joint Lead Arranger, Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, CGMI is hereby
appointed as Joint Lead Arranger and Syndication Agent, and Bank of America,
Bank One, N.A. and U.S. Bank National Association, are hereby appointed as
Co-Documentation Agents hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and each
Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to act as its agent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Agent agrees to act
upon the express conditions contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, as applicable. The provisions of this Section 9 are solely for the
benefit of Agents and Lenders and Company shall have no rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In performing its functions and
duties under this Agreement, each Agent shall act solely as an agent of Lenders
and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation
towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Upon the conclusion of the Initial Period, all obligations of the
Joint Lead Arrangers hereunder shall terminate and thereafter the Joint Lead
Arrangers (in such capacities) shall have no obligations or liabilities under
any of the Loan Documents.

                  B.       Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents. It is
the intent of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no
violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of
banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in
such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the
enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case Collateral Agent deems that
by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise
any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan
Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or
<PAGE>
                                      -92-

necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that the Collateral Agent
appoint an additional individual or institution as a separate trustee,
co-trustee, collateral agent or collateral co-agent (any such additional
individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a
"Supplemental Collateral Agent" and collectively as "Supplemental Collateral
Agents").

                  In the event that the Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental
Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right,
power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the
Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and
vest in such Supplemental Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the
extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such
rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform
such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation
contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance
thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by
either the Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and (ii) the
provisions of this Section 9 and of subsections 10.2 and 10.3 that refer to the
Collateral Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral
Agent and all references therein to the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be
references to Agent and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context
may require.

                  Should any instrument in writing from Company or any other
Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by the
Collateral Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him
or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, Company shall, or shall cause
such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such
instruments promptly upon request by the Collateral Agent. In case any
Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, to the extent permitted by
law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Collateral Agent until the
appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

                  9.2.     Powers and Duties; General Immunity

                  A.       Powers; Duties Specified. Each Lender irrevocably
authorizes each Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to
exercise such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents as are specifically delegated or granted to such Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers, rights and remedies as are
reasonably incidental thereto. An Agent shall have only those duties and
responsibilities that are expressly specified in this Agreement with respect to
such Agent and the other Loan Documents. An Agent may exercise such powers,
rights and remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or
employees. An Agent shall not have, by reason of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and
nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, expressed or
implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon any Agent any
obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

                  B.       No Responsibility for Certain Matters. An Agent shall
not be responsible to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or
statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statements or
in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or certificates or
any other documents furnished or made by such Agent to Lenders or by or on
behalf of Company to such Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loan
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the financial
condition or business affairs of Company or any other Person liable for the
payment of any Obligations, nor shall such Agent be required to ascertain or
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions,
provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Loan Documents or as
to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of the Letters of Credit or
as to the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Potential
Event of Default. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, an Agent shall not have any liability arising from
confirmations of the amount of outstanding Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage
or the component amounts thereof.

                  C.       Exculpatory Provisions. None of Agents or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to
Lenders for any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection
with any of the Loan Documents except to the extent caused by such Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. An Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any
act or the taking of any action (including the failure to take an action) in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or from the
exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or
thereunder unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in
respect thereof from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required
to give such instructions under subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt of such
instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be),
such Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from
acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with
such instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) an
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and
shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and
judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Company and its Subsidiaries),
accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against an Agent as a result of
such Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from acting under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions
of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such
instructions under subsection 10.6).

                  D.       Agents Entitled to Act as Lenders. The agency hereby
created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or
impose any duties or obligations upon, an Agent in its individual capacity as a
Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters
of Credit, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the
duties and
<PAGE>
                                      -94-

functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any
similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include such
Agent in its individual capacity. Each Agent and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory or other business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if
it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
other consideration from Company for services in connection with this Agreement
and otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.

                  9.3.     Representations and Warranties; No Responsibility for
                           Appraisal of Creditworthiness

                  Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Loans and the issuance of
Letters of Credit hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its
own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Company and its Subsidiaries. Agents
shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing
basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders
or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect
thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at
any time or times thereafter, and Agents shall not have any responsibility with
respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to
Lenders.

                  9.4.     Right to Indemnity

                  Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally
agrees to indemnify each Agent, to the extent that such Agent shall not have
been reimbursed by Company, for and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
such Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its
duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity
as Agent, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished to an Agent for any purpose
shall, in the opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such
Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the
acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.

                  9.5.     Successor Agent and Swing Line Lender

                  A.       Successor Agent. Any Agent may resign at any time by
giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Company. Upon any
such notice of resignation, Requisite Lenders shall have the right, with, so
long as no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the consent of Company (not to be unreasonably

<PAGE>
                                      -95-

withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor to such Agent. Upon the acceptance
of any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, that successor
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, as the case may be, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as an Agent, the
provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement.

                  B.       Successor Swing Line Lender. Any resignation of
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall also constitute the
resignation of CSFB or its successor as Swing Line Lender, and any successor
Administrative Agent appointed pursuant to subsection 9.5A shall, upon its
acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Swing Line Lender for all
purposes hereunder. In such event (i) Company shall prepay any outstanding Swing
Line Loans made by the retiring Administrative Agent in its capacity as Swing
Line Lender, (ii) upon such prepayment, the retiring Administrative Agent and
Swing Line Lender shall surrender the Swing Line Note held by it to Company for
cancellation, and (iii) Company shall issue a new Swing Line Note to the
successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender substantially in the form
of Exhibit VI annexed hereto, in the principal amount of the Swing Line Loan
Commitment then in effect and with other appropriate insertions.

                  9.6.     Pledge Agreements and Guaranties

                  Each Lender hereby further authorizes Collateral Agent, on
behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into each Pledge Agreement as
secured party and to be the agent for and representative of Lenders under the
Subsidiary Guaranty, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of each
Pledge Agreement and the Subsidiary Guaranty; provided that Collateral Agent
shall not (i) enter into or consent to any amendment, modification, termination
or waiver of any provision contained in any Pledge Agreement or the Subsidiary
Guaranty or (ii) release any Collateral (except as otherwise expressly permitted
or required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the applicable Pledge
Agreement), in each case without the prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or, if
required pursuant to subsection 10.6, all Lenders); provided further, however,
that, without further written consent or authorization from Lenders, Collateral
Agent may execute any documents or instruments necessary to (a) release any Lien
encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of a sale or other
disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders
have otherwise consented or (b) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from the
Subsidiary Guaranty if all of the capital stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor is
sold to any Person (other than an Affiliate of Company) pursuant to a sale or
other disposition permitted hereunder or to which Requisite Lenders have
otherwise consented. Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the
contrary notwithstanding, Company, Collateral Agent and each Lender hereby agree
that (X) no Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the
Collateral under any Pledge Agreement or to enforce the Subsidiary Guaranty, it
being understood and agreed that all rights and remedies under the Pledge
Agreements and the Subsidiary Guaranty may be exercised solely by Collateral
Agent for the benefit of
<PAGE>
                                      -96-

Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y) in the event of a
foreclosure by Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or
private sale, Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all
of such Collateral at any such sale and Collateral Agent, as agent for and
representative of Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their
respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree
in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement
or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold
at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on
account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by Collateral Agent at
such sale.

                                  SECTION 10.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

                  10.1.    Assignments and Participations in Loans and Letters
                           of Credit

                  A.       General. Subject to subsection 10.1B, each Lender
shall have the right at any time to (i) sell, assign or transfer to any Eligible
Assignee, or (ii) sell participations to any Person in, all or any part of its
Commitments or any Loan or Loans made by it or its Letters of Credit or in any
case its rights or obligations with respect thereto or participations therein or
any other interest herein or in any other obligations owed to it; provided,
further, that no such sale, assignment or transfer described in clause (i) above
shall be effective unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting such sale,
assignment or transfer shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent and
recorded in the Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii); provided, further
that no such sale, assignment, transfer or participation of any Letter of Credit
or any participation therein may be made separately from a sale, assignment,
transfer or participation of a corresponding interest in the Revolving Loan
Commitment and the Revolving Loans of the Lender effecting such sale,
assignment, transfer or participation; and provided, further that, anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Swing Line Loan Commitment
and the Swing Line Loans of Swing Line Lender may not be sold, assigned or
transferred as described in clause (i) above to any Person other than a
successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender to the extent contemplated
by subsection 9.5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 10.1, no
Lender shall, as between Company and such Lender, be relieved of any of its
obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or transfer of, or any
granting of participations in, all or any part of its Commitments or the Loans,
the Letters of Credit or participations therein, or the other Obligations owed
to such Lender.

                  B.       Assignments.

                  (i)      Amounts and Terms of Assignments. Each Commitment,
Loan, Letter of Credit or participation therein, or other Obligation may (a) be
assigned in any amount to another Lender, or to an Affiliate of the assigning
Lender or another Lender or to an Approved Fund, with the giving of notice to
Company and Administrative Agent or (b) be assigned in an aggre-
<PAGE>
                                      -97-

gate amount of not less than (i) $5,000,000 in the case of Revolving Loans and
Revolving Commitments and Tranche A Term Loans and (ii) $1,000,000 in the case
of Tranche B Term Loans (or, in each case, such lesser amount as shall
constitute the aggregate amount of the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit and
participations therein, and other Obligations of the assigning Lender) to any
other Eligible Assignee with the consent of Company, Administrative Agent and,
in the case of an assignment of Revolving Loans, each Issuing Lender which then
has a Letter of Credit outstanding (which consent of Company, Administrative
Agent and Issuing Lender shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided that assignment to an Affiliate (or an Approved Fund) of the assigning
Lender that would result in increased costs to Company shall also require the
prior written consent of Company and such prior written consent of Company may
not be unreasonably withheld and which may be conditioned on the Eligible
Assignee agreeing not to require reimbursement from Company of such increased
costs; provided, further, that after an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the consent of Company shall not be required for assignment to an
Eligible Assignee. To the extent of any such assignment in accordance with
either clause (a) or (b) above, the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its
obligations with respect to its Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or
participations therein, or other obligations or the portion thereof so assigned.
The parties to each such assignment shall (i) electronically execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance via an electronic
settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (which initially shall
be ClearPar, LLC) or (ii) manually execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation
fee of US$3,500 (except in the event of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate
of a Lender or an Approved Fund) and, in each case, such forms, certificates or
other evidence, if any, with respect to United States federal income tax
withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be
required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a).
Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recordation, from and after the
effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement, (y) the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (z)
the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement,
relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination of
this Agreement under subsection 10.9B) and be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all
or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided that,
anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding,
if such Lender is the Issuing Lender with respect to any outstanding Letters of
Credit such Lender shall continue to have all rights and obligations of an
Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or
expiration of such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn
thereunder). The Commitments hereunder shall be modified to reflect the
Commitment of such assignee and any remaining Commitment of such assigning
Lender and, if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of the Notes
hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment
or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable Notes to
Administrative Agent for cancellation, and
<PAGE>
                                      -98-

thereupon new Notes shall be issued to the assignee and/or to the assigning
Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit IV-A, Exhibit IV-B or Exhibit V
annexed hereto, as the case may be, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the
new Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee
and/or the assigning Lender.

                  (ii)     Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in
Register. Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an assigning
Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together
with the processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection 10.1B(i) and
any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal
income tax withholding matters that such assignee may be required to deliver to
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a), Administrative Agent
shall, if Administrative Agent and Company have consented to the assignment
evidenced thereby (in each case to the extent such consent is required pursuant
to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment Agreement by executing a
counterpart thereof as provided therein (which acceptance shall evidence any
required consent of Administrative Agent to such assignment), (b) record the
information contained therein in the Register, and (c) promptly provide a copy
of the Register to Company on the last Business Day of each quarter and at its
request from time to time. Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each
Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as provided in this
subsection 10.1B(ii).

                  C.       Participations. The holder of any participation,
other than an Affiliate of the Lender granting such participation, shall not be
entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder
except action directly affecting (i) the extension of the scheduled final
maturity date of any Loan allocated to such participation or (ii) a reduction of
the principal amount of or the rate of interest payable on any Loan allocated to
such participation, and all amounts payable by Company hereunder (including
amounts payable to such Lender pursuant to subsections 2.6D, 2.7 and 3.6) shall
be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation. Company and
each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that, solely for purposes of
subsections 10.4 and 10.5, (a) any participation will give rise to a direct
obligation of Company to the participant and (b) the participant shall be
considered to be a "Lender".

                  D.       Pledges of Obligations. In addition to the
assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this
subsection 10.1, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its
Loans, the other Obligations owed to such Lender, and its Notes to secure
obligations of such Lender including without limitation any assignment or pledge
to a Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating circular
issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that (i) no Lender shall, as
between Company and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder
as a result of any such assignment and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such
Federal Reserve Bank be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require
the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.
<PAGE>
                                      -99-

                  E.       Assignments to Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. In
addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing
provisions of this subsection 10.1, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant
to special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPV"), identified as such in writing
from time to time by the Granting Lender to Administrative Agent and Company,
the option to provide to Company all or any part of any Loan that such Granting
Lender would otherwise be obligated to make Company pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make
any Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise
fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be
obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan
by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the
same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain
with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it
will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against,
such SPV, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In
addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection
10.1E(i), any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent
of, Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loan to the Granting
Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by Company and
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii)
disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
guarantee or credit liquidity enhancement to such SPV. After the date of a grant
to any SPV, this section may not be amended without the written consent of such
SPV.

                  F.       Information. Each Lender may furnish any information
concerning Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender from
time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignee and
participants), subject to subsection 10.19.

                  G.       Representations of Lenders. Each Lender listed on the
signature pages hereof hereby represents and warrants (i) that it is an Eligible
Assignee described in clause (A) of the definition thereof; (ii) that it has
experience and expertise in the making of or investing in loans such as the
Loans; and (iii) that it will make or invest in its Loans for its own account in
the ordinary course of its business and without a view to distribution of such
Loans within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other
federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the provisions of
this subsection 10.1, the disposition of such Loans or any interests therein
shall at all times remain within its exclusive control). Each Lender that
becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to
agree that the
<PAGE>
                                     -100-

representations and warranties of such Lender contained in Section 2(c) of such
Assignment Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference.

                  10.2.    Expenses

                  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, Company agrees to pay promptly after the presentation of invoices
(i) all the actual and reasonable costs and expenses of Agents in connection
with the preparation of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers
or other modifications thereto; (ii) all reasonable costs of furnishing all
opinions by counsel for Company (including any opinions requested by Lenders as
to any legal matters arising hereunder) and of Company's performance of and
compliance with all agreements and conditions on its part to be performed or
complied with under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents including with
respect to confirming compliance with environmental, insurance and solvency
requirements; (iii) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel
to Agents (including allocated costs of internal counsel) in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and administration of the Loan Documents and
any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and any other
documents or matters requested by Company; (iv) all the actual costs and
reasonable expenses of creating and perfecting Liens in favor of Collateral
Agent on behalf of Lenders pursuant to any Pledge Agreement, including filing
and recording fees, expenses and taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, search fees,
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel to Collateral Agent and
of counsel providing any opinions that Collateral Agent or Requisite Lenders may
request in respect of the Collateral Documents or the Liens created pursuant
thereto; (v) the custody or preservation of any of the Collateral; (vi) all
other actual and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agents in connection
with the syndication of the Commitments; and (vii) after the occurrence of an
Event of Default, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
(including allocated costs of internal counsel) and costs of settlement,
incurred by Agents and Lenders in enforcing any Obligations of or in collecting
any payments due from any Loan Party hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
by reason of such Event of Default (including in connection with the sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral or the
enforcement of the Subsidiary Guaranty) or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

                  10.3.    Indemnity

                  In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to subsection
10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
Company agrees to defend (subject to Indemnitees' selection of counsel),
indemnify, pay and hold harmless Agents and Lenders, and the officers,
directors, employees, trustee, agents and affiliates of Agents and Lenders
(collectively called the "Indemnitees"), from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities (as hereinafter defined); provided that Company shall
not have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities
<PAGE>
                                     -101-

arise solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee
as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  As used herein, "Indemnified Liabilities" means, collectively,
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages (including natural
resource damages), penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims (including
Environmental Claims), costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for
Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
proceeding commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any such
Indemnitee shall be designated as a party or a potential party thereto, and any
fees or expenses incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether
direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or
foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations (including securities and
commercial laws, statutes, rules or regulations and Environmental Laws), on
common law or equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating
to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including Lenders' agreement to
make the Loans hereunder or the use or intended use of the proceeds thereof or
the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder or the use or intended use of any
thereof, or any enforcement of any of the Loan Documents (including any sale of,
collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral or the
enforcement of the Subsidiary Guaranty) or (ii) the statements contained in the
commitment letter delivered by any Lender to Company with respect thereto.

                  To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay
and hold harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in
whole or in part because they are violative of any law or public policy, Company
shall contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy
under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified
Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

                  10.4.    Set-Off

                  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by Company
at any time or from time to time, without notice to Company or to any other
Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including
Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured,
but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or
owing by that Lender to or for the credit or the account of Company against and
on account of the obligations and liabilities of Company to that Lender under
this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein and the other
Loan Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising out of
or connected with this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations
therein or any other Loan Document, provided that said obligations and
liabilities shall then be due and payable (whether by acceleration or
otherwise).

                  10.5.    Ratable Sharing

                  Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them
shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans
made and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization
upon security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan
Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash
collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in
respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts owing to that Lender
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "Aggregate
Amounts Owing" to such Lender) which is greater than the proportion received by
any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Owing to such other Lender,
then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify
Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and
(ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations (which it shall
be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously
upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate
Amounts Owing to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of Aggregate
Amounts Owing shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate
Amounts Owing to them; provided that if all or part of such proportionately
greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from
such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or otherwise, those
purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such
participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent
of such recovery, but without interest. Company expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased
may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with
respect to any and all monies owing by Company to that holder with respect
thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation
held by that holder.

                  10.6.    Amendments and Waivers

                  A.       No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or of the Notes, and no consent to any departure
by Company therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written
concurrence of Requisite Lenders; provided that any such amendment,

Lenders hereunder; increases the maximum duration of Interest Periods permitted
hereunder; extends the required expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond

to all or substantially all of the Collateral; releases all or substantially all
Subsidiary Guarantors from their respective obligations under the Subsidiary
Guaranty, in each case other than in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents; or changes in any manner the provisions contained in subsection 8.1
or this subsection 10.6 shall be effective only if evidenced by a writing signed
by or on behalf of all Lenders; provided, further, that no such amendment,
modification, termination, waiver or consent shall increase the Commitments of a
Lender over the amount hereof then in effect without the consent of such Lender;
provided, further, that if any matter described in this sentence relates only to
(a) all Term Loans, the approval of all Term Lenders shall be sufficient, (b)
Tranche A Term Loans or Tranche B Term Loans, as the case may be, the approval
of all of the Lenders of the affected Term Loan shall be sufficient and (c) a
Revolving Loan or Revolving Loan Commitment, the approval of all Revolving
Lenders shall be sufficient. In addition, (i) any amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of any of the provisions contained in Section 4 with
respect to any Revolving Loans or Letters of Credit made or issued after the
Closing Date shall be effective only if evidenced by a writing signed by or on
behalf of Administrative Agent and Majority Facility Lenders with respect to
Revolving Loans, (ii) no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
provision of any Note shall be effective without the written concurrence of the
Lender which is the holder of that Note, (iii) no amendment, modification,

provision of this Agreement relating to the Swing Line Loan Commitment or the

and, with respect to any reduction of the amount or postponement of the due date
of any amount payable in respect of any Letter of Credit, the Majority Facility
Lenders with respect to the Revolving Loans, (v) no amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of any provision of Section 9 or of any other provision of
this Agreement which, by its terms, expressly requires the approval or
concurrence of any Agent shall be effective without the written concurrence of
such Agent, (vi) any amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement that adversely affects the rights of Lenders holding
Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class shall
not be effective without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in
interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class,
(vii) any amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement that extends the interim amortization of any Class shall not be

amortization is so extended and (viii) any amendment which (a) adds a new
tranche of term loans to this Agreement, (b) increases the Base Rate Margin or
the Eurodollar Rate Margin applicable to any Class or (c) shortens the interim
amortization of any Class, shall not be effective without the written consent of
Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused
Commitments of each Class. Each such amendment, modification, waiver or consent
shall indicate with respect
<PAGE>
                                     -104-

to each Lender party thereto whether such Lender is executing in the capacity of
a Requisite Lender and/or as a member of a Class. Administrative Agent may, but
shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute
amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender. Any
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on Company in
any case shall entitle Company to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver
or consent effected in accordance with this subsection 10.6 shall be binding
upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by
Company, on Company.

                  B.       Replacement of Lender. If, in connection with any
proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination to any of the provisions of
this Agreement as contemplated by the first proviso contained in the first
sentence of subsection 10.6A, the consent of the Requisite Lenders is obtained
but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required
is not obtained, then Administrative Agent shall have the right with the consent
of Company, so long as all non-consenting Lenders whose individual consent is
required are treated as described in either clause (A) or (B) below, to either
(A) replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more
Replacement Lenders pursuant to subsection 2.8 so long as at the time of such
replacement each outstanding Loan of each such Lender being replaced is repaid
in full and so long as each such Replacement Lender consents to the proposed
change, waiver, discharge or termination or (B) terminate such non-consenting
Lender's Commitments and/or repay in full each outstanding Loan of such Lender,
provided that, unless the Commitments that are terminated, and Loans repaid,
pursuant to preceding clause (B) are immediately replaced in full at such time
through the addition of new Lenders or the increase of the Commitments and/or
outstanding Loans of existing Lenders (who in each case must specifically
consent thereto), then in the case of any action pursuant to preceding clause
(B) the Requisite Lenders (determined after giving effect to the proposed
action) shall specifically consent thereto; provided, further, that Company
shall not have the right to terminate such non-consenting Lender's Commitments
and repay in full its outstanding Loans pursuant to clause (B) if, immediately
after the termination of such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, the Revolving
Loan Exposure of all Lenders would exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments of all
Lenders; and provided, further, that in any event Administrative Agent shall not
have the right to replace a Lender, terminate its Commitments or repay its Loans
solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender's rights (and the withholding
of any required consent by such Lender) to refuse to increase its Commitment
over the amount then in effect pursuant to the second proviso contained in the
first sentence of subsection 10.6A.

                  10.7.    Independence of Covenants

                  All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so
that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such
covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would
otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not
<PAGE>
                                     -105-

avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default if
such action is taken or condition exists.

                  10.8.    Notices

                  Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice or
other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing
and may be personally served or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or
courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person
or by courier service, upon receipt of telefacsimile, or three Business Days
after depositing it in the United States mail with postage prepaid and properly
addressed; provided that notices to Agents shall not be effective until
received. For the purposes hereof, the address of each party hereto shall be as
set forth under such party's name on the signature pages hereof or (i) as to
Company and any Agent, such other address as shall be designated by such Person
in a written notice delivered to the other parties hereto and (ii) as to each
other party, such other address as shall be designated by such party in a
written notice delivered to Administrative Agent.

                  10.9.    Survival of Representations, Warranties and
                           Agreements

                  A.       All representations, warranties and agreements made
herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making
of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder.

                  B.       Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied
by law to the contrary, the agreements of Company set forth in subsections 2.6D,
2.7, 3.5A, 3.6, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in
subsections 9.2C, 9.4 and 10.5 shall to the extent set forth therein survive the
payment of the Loans, the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit
and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the termination of
this Agreement.

                  10.10.   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative

                  No failure or delay on the part of any Agent or any Lender in
the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a
waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

                  10.11.   Marshalling; Payments Set Aside

                  Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be under any
obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Company or any other party or
against or in payment of any or all
<PAGE>
                                     -106-

of the Obligations. To the extent that Company makes a payment or payments to
Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to Administrative Agent for the benefit of
Lenders), or Administrative Agent or Lenders enforce any security interests or
exercise their rights of set-off, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any
other state or federal law, common law or any equitable cause, then, to the
extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to
be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto,
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or
payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

                  10.12.   Severability

                  In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement or
the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  10.13.   Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders'
                           Rights

                  The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender
shall be responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender
hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action
taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute
Lenders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of
entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a
separate and independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and
enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be necessary
for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for
such purpose.

                  10.14.   Headings

                  Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included
herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this
Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

                  10.15.   Applicable Law

                  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  10.16.   Successors and Assigns

                  This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and the successors and assigns of Lenders (it being understood
that Lenders' rights of assignment are subject to subsection 10.1). Neither
Company's rights or obligations hereunder nor any interest therein may be
assigned or delegated by Company without the prior written consent of all
Lenders.

                  10.17.   CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS

JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK. BY EXECUTING AND
DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, COMPANY, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY

         NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS;

                  (ii)     WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS WITH

                  (iii)    AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH
         PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED
         MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO COMPANY AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN
         ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSECTION 10.8;

                  (iv)     AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (iii) ABOVE
         IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER COMPANY IN ANY SUCH
         PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND
         BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT;

                  (v)      AGREES THAT LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS
         IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
         COMPANY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION; AND

                  (vi)     AGREES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION 10.17
         RELATING TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE SHALL BE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE TO
         THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW

                  10.18.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

                  EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE
ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON
OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY
DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR
THE LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. The scope of this
waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be
filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction,
including contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other
common law and statutory claims. Each party hereto acknowledges that this waiver
is a material inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each has
already relied on this waiver in entering into this Agreement, and that each
will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each
party hereto further warrants and represents that it has reviewed this waiver
with its legal counsel and that it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury
trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER IS
IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING
(OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION
10.18 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY
TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS MADE HEREUNDER. In the event of litigation,
this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.

                  10.19.   Confidentiality

                  Each Lender shall hold all non-public information obtained
pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement which has been identified as
confidential by Company in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures
for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe
and sound banking practices, if applicable, it being understood and agreed by
Company that in any event a Lender may make disclosures to the accountants,
auditors, attorneys, and Affiliates of such Lender or disclosures reasonably
required by any bona fide assignee, transferee or participant or to any actual
or prospective contractual counterparty (or its advisor) to any securitization,
hedge or other derivative transaction in connection with the contemplated
assignment or transfer by such Lender of any Loans or any participations therein
or disclosures required or requested by any governmental agency or
representative thereof or pursuant to legal process; provided that, in each of
the foregoing cases, the Person to which disclosure is to be made is informed of
the confidential nature of such information and agrees to maintain its
confidentiality; provided, further, that, unless specifically prohibited by
applicable law or court order, each Lender shall notify Company of any request
by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such
request in connection with any routine compliance examination or examination of
the financial condition of such Lender by such governmental
<PAGE>
                                     -109-

agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of
such information; and provided, further, that in no event shall any Lender be
obligated or required to return any materials furnished by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of information
as provided in this subsection shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such information as such person would accord to
its own confidential information.

                  10.20.   Counterparts; Effectiveness
