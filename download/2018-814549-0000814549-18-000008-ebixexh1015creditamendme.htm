Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (1) the &#13;&#10;proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by the Lenders other than the Swingline Lender shall be &#13;&#10;immediately delivered by the Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender (and not to the &#13;&#10;Borrower) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the Refunded Swingline Loans and (2) &#13;&#10;on the day such Revolving Loans are made, the Swingline Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment &#13;&#10;Percentage of the Refunded Swingline Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a &#13;&#10;Revolving Loan made by the Swingline Lender to the Borrower, and such portion of the &#13;&#10;Swingline Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swingline Loans and &#13;&#10;shall no longer be due under the Swingline Note of the Swingline Lender but shall instead &#13;&#10;constitute part of the Swingline Lender&#8217;s outstanding Revolving Loans to the Borrower and shall &#13;&#10;be due under the Revolving Loan Note issued by the Borrower to the Swingline Lender.  The &#13;&#10;Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender to charge the &#13;&#10;Borrower&#8217;s accounts with the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender (up to the amount &#13;&#10;available in each such account) in order to immediately pay the Swingline Lender the amount of &#13;&#10;the Refunded Swingline Loans to the extent of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by &#13;&#10;the Lenders, including the Revolving Loans deemed to be made by the Swingline Lender, are &#13;&#10;insufficient to repay in full the Refunded Swingline Loans.

On the Business Day that notice is provided by the &#13;&#10;Swingline Lender (or by the 11:00 a.m. on the following Business Day if such notice is provided &#13;&#10;after 2:00 p.m.), each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment shall deliver to the Swingline &#13;&#10;Lender an amount equal to its respective participation in the applicable unpaid amount in same &#13;&#10;day funds at the Principal Office of the Swingline Lender.  In order to evidence such participation &#13;&#10;each Lender holding a Revolving Commitment agrees to enter into a participation agreement at &#13;&#10;the request of the Swingline Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the &#13;&#10;Swingline Lender.

The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of &#13;&#10;Credit for the account of the Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower&#8217;s &#13;&#10;business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. &#13;&#10;(j) Conflict with Issuer Documents.  In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof &#13;&#10;and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. &#13;&#10;Section 2.4 Pro Rata Shares; Availability of Funds. &#13;&#10;(a) Pro Rata Shares.  All Loans shall be made, and all participations purchased, by the &#13;&#10;applicable Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their respective pro rata shares of the Loans, it &#13;&#10;being understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other &#13;&#10;Lender&#8217;s obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder or purchase a participation required hereby nor &#13;&#10;shall any Revolving Commitment or any Term Loan Commitment, or the portion of the aggregate &#13;&#10;outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans or the Term Loans, of any Lender be increased or &#13;&#10;decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in such other Lender&#8217;s obligation to make a Loan &#13;&#10;requested hereunder or purchase a participation required hereby. &#13;&#10;(b) Availability of Funds. &#13;&#10;(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.  Unless the &#13;&#10;Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any &#13;&#10;Borrowing (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date &#13;&#10;of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such &#13;&#10;Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has &#13;&#10;made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.1(c) or, in the case of a &#13;&#10;Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance &#13;&#10;with and at the time required by Section 2.1(c) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make &#13;&#10;available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact &#13;&#10;made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the &#13;&#10;applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith &#13;&#10;on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for &#13;&#10;each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but &#13;&#10;excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be &#13;&#10;made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the &#13;&#10;Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and &#13;&#10;(B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate &#13;&#10;Loans, plus, in either case, any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by &#13;&#10;the Administrative Agent in connection therewith.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay &#13;&#10;such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the &#13;&#10;Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by &#13;&#10;the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the &#13;&#10;Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in &#13;&#10;such Borrowing.

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this &#13;&#10;Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the &#13;&#10;same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its &#13;&#10;own confidential information. &#13;&#10;Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders acknowledges &#13;&#10;that (i) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or any &#13;&#10;Subsidiary, as the case may be, (ii) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material &#13;&#10;non-public information and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with &#13;&#10;Applicable Law, including United States federal and state securities laws. &#13;&#10;Section 11.16 Usury Savings Clause.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the &#13;&#10;aggregate interest rate charged or agreed to be paid with respect to any of the Obligations, including all &#13;&#10;charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under Applicable Laws shall not &#13;&#10;exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding &#13;&#10;sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the aggregate outstanding &#13;&#10;amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount &#13;&#10;of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated &#13;&#10;rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect.  In addition, if when the Loans &#13;&#10;made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase &#13;&#10;provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the &#13;&#10;stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent &#13;&#10;permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference &#13;&#10;between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest &#13;&#10;Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the &#13;&#10;Lenders and each of the Credit Parties to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if &#13;&#10;any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the &#13;&#10;Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall &#13;&#10;at such Lender&#8217;s option be applied to the aggregate outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or &#13;&#10;be refunded to each of the applicable Credit Parties.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, &#13;&#10;charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, such &#13;&#10;Person may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, (a) characterize any payment that is not &#13;&#10;principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the &#13;&#10;effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of &#13;&#10;interest, throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. &#13;&#10;Section 11.17 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
